The original works lacked references to unpublished sources when published before 1970. Government archives were opened to an extent by the Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1967. The works were published with only references to published sources. A number of official histories were produced by government departments. The authors worked under the same conditions and had the same access to official files but their works did not appear in the History of the Second World War. I am currently researching deployment of the BEF, before and possibly after 01 Sep 1939. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *","Not to be outdone by the detailed and sprawling history of New Zealands involvement in the Second World War, the Australian military undertook one of the longest and largest historical endeavours the nation has ever seen.  The 22 volumes, written by 14 authors, were published by the Australian War Memorial over a 25-year period between 1952 and 1977. As after the Great War, Canada did not issue a collected official history of the war, but commissioned a series of historical works that, taken together, enable readers to form a comprehensive picture. Owing to the magnitude of the German defeat, it took more than thirty years before the first official work on the Second World War was started. Originally planned as a ten-volume work, the expanding research necessitated the split of some volumes into two seperate books. Published by the historical section of the German Army, the Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt, the resulting work titled “Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg” progresses from a more operational outlook to a more inclusive viewpoint in later volumes, examining in detail the terrors war brought to Europe. The History of the Second World War is the official history of Britain’s contribution to the Second World War and was published by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO). The immense project was sub-divided into areas to ease publication. The History Office of the General Staff of the Italian Army (Stato Maggiore dell’esercito – Ufficio Storico) is responsible for official military history, and thus has published a series of monographs, illustrating various aspects of military history from Italy’s unification to the present. Of course the Second World War makes up a significant part of the available volumes. However, no official, complete italian history of the Second World War was eveeer written. The transcribed name of the official Japanese history of the Second World War is “Senshi Sosho”. Its a monumental work, covering virtually all aspects of the war except the Japanese war crimes. The Senshi Sosho totals 102 volumes that consist of 34 volumes on the Imperial General Headquarters, 37 volumes on the Army, 21 volumes on the Navy, nine volumes on the aerial war the Army and one volume of chronology. The fifty volume series covers all areas of New Zealand’s involvement in the Second World War, from detailed accounts of particular battalions, to the political and economic background and consequences, to full accounts of particular episodes and campaigns. The number of studies and books published by the US military on the Second World War alone fills a small library. Official histories do not only exist for the Army and the Navy, then the two arms of the US military, but also for the nascent forces of the Air Force and the Marines, and of course for countless other organisations like the Corps of Engineers or the Coast Guard. The first official history of the Soviet Union in the Second World War was published from 1960-64 by a collective and describes the war following Germanys attack on the USSR.  Subsequent works published documents and statistics, but neither the six-volume official history nor most of the subsequent publications have ever been translated to English.",,,,,,,,

where does the hogan stand get its name from,"The Hogan Stand at Croke Park, built in 1924, is named after Michael Hogan.","It is always a spectacular highlight of the Six Nations rugby union championship. Tomorrow's England vs Ireland international will also make history as an act of sporting reconciliation. The event is in danger of being overshadowed, however, by a dispute over the playing of God Save the Queen. For the first time the annual match is being staged at Dublin's Croke Park, the traditional home of gaelic games and the scene of an infamous massacre by British ""Black and Tan"" forces more than 80 years ago. The Irish team's home ground, Landsdowne Road in properous south Dublin, is in the process of being demolished to make way for a larger, more modern arena. So this season the game has been transferred to the city's only other major stadium, Croke Park, on the north side, which hosts Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) games. The GAA was founded in 1884 amid a surge of nationalist fervour aimed at promoting hurling and gaelic football in preference to English or ""foreign"" games. In 1918, in the run-up to the Irish war of independence, the organisation was even included in a list of organisations banned by the British government. Until five years ago, members of Northern Ireland's police force and the UK armed forces were barred from participating in GAA matches. The prospect of an English rugby team being greeted by an Irish army band performing God Save the Queen is still too much for some ardent GAA fans and hardline republicans. For them, Croke Park is doubly-hallowed ground because of what occurred there on November 21 1920. In what became known as the first Bloody Sunday, a detachment of ""Black and Tan"" police auxilaries - intent on extracting revenge for IRA attacks - opened fire on the crowds gathered to watch a GAA match. Fourteen spectators were killed and British control over Ireland was further undermined. Among those who died were Michael Hogan, a Tipperary player. The Hogan stand in Croke Park is named after him. Earlier this week J J Barrett, the son of a celebrated GAA player who won six all-Ireland final medals, announced he would withdraw his father's medal collection from the museum at Croke Park in protest at the decision to play the British national anthem this weekend. ""I cannot reconcile the provocative words of God Save The Queen being sung in the very stadium where Michael Hogan and others died at the hands of crown forces on Bloody Sunday,"" he wrote in a published letter. ""The words run contrary to our [GAA] constitution and I believe the GAA should have foreseen this problem when they rented out Croke Park and instead insisted on an England's Call type of musical prelude - the sort we are confined to now when we play away from home. Republican Sinn Féin, a dissident faction opposed to the peace process, is planning a protest near the ground objecting to the playing of the UK's national anthem. The police have stepped up security around the stadium. Yesterday the Archbishop of Cashel, Dermot Clifford, who is also a patron of the GAA, waded into the controversy by giving his blessing to the singing of God Save The Queen. ""As the Lansdowne Road stadium is being redeveloped, the GAA has allowed the IRFU to stage international rugby matches in Croke Park,"" he said. ""It is logical therefore that the protocols which apply to Landsdowne Road should also apply to Croke Park on Saturday."" The venue is politically sensitive. Earlier this month it was suggested that the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, might use the occasion to lay a wreath as an act of atonement for the 1920 massacre. Disapproval by unionists and concerns that it would confuse sport with politics to the detriment of both supposedly dissuaded him. Mr Hain later issued a statement declaring: ""I have never proposed doing anything other than attend and watch the match at the specific request of the Taoiseach and prime minister."" The issue has sparked a debate among media commentators in Dublin about residual Irish resentment of England. ""We are a sovereign nation with average per capita incomes above those of the UK,"" wrote Fintan O'Toole in the Irish Times. ""There are probably no two countries in the world whose governments work more closely together than the Irish and British governments do. ""It is time we got over ourselves. The great thing about the arrival of the English rugby team in Croke Park is that it provides a precise, public, almost ritual occasion when we can ... be confident and at ease in situations where we used to feel Anglophobia."" Another commentator called for the removal of national anthems from sporting occasions on the grounds that they were inherently bombastic and jingoistic. ""Otherwise we are liable inadvertently to do more damage to Anglo-Irish relations than Jade Goody has done to Angl-Indian relations,"" he observed. The sky-high prices being charged for tickets on eBay demonstrates there is no likelihood of a boycott of the match. A pair of seats was recently offered for €2,400 (£1,600). The stadium's capacity is 82,300. One letter writer to an Irish paper pointed out that God Save the Queen had already been played at Croke Park in 2003 for the Special Olympics. There was no complaint then.",,,,,,,,,

why do we celebrate the feast of pentecost,"The Christian feast day of Pentecost is seven weeks after Easter Sunday: that is to say, the fiftieth day after Easter inclusive of Easter Sunday. It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles. Some Christians believe that this event represents the birth of the Church. The Feast of the Ascension occurs 40 days after Easter, so Pentecost is a moveable feast. In Eastern Christianity, Pentecost can also refer to the entire 50 days between Easter and the feast, and the book containing the liturgical texts for the period is called the Pentecostarion.","Start contacting with suitable matchesJust 1 Rupee a day..!

how long has there been land plants on earth,"Evidence for the appearance of the first land plants occurs in the Ordovician, around 450 million years ago, in the form of fossil spores. Land plants began to diversify in the Late Silurian, from around 430 million years ago, and the results of their diversification are displayed in remarkable detail in an early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert. This chert, formed in volcanic hot springs, preserved several species of early plants in cellular detail by petrification.",,,,,,,,,,

who wrote the song we built this city,"""We Built This City"" is a 1985 song written by Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf, and originally recorded by US rock group Starship and released as their debut single on their album Knee Deep in the Hoopla.","For this “Things That Bring Back Memories” post, I am going to pick something in the topic of “Music”.  My family is one that really loves music, and can think back to where we were when we heard a certain song, etc.  I can’t play music for anything, but my husband is a bass guitar player, and our son plays the piano.  Lucky I don’t have to do anything but listen, otherwise, we’d be in trouble. :/ So starting on this beautiful Monday of the week, I’ll give you a little look into my life and past with “Things That Brings Back Memories” for me.  This Starship song We Built This City is one that a lot of us remember.   So many of us would give each other that “look” when this came on the radio and then start our rendition in karaoke mode!! 🙂  Apparently listeners loved it, sending it to the top of the Billboard charts.  But since then it’s topped (or placed) in critics’ lists in publications like Blender and Rolling Stone as one of the worst popular tunes ever recorded.  How sad!  I never thought it was a bad one.  Have you ever heard of this song?  Check it out here: Is there a song that brings back memories for you? or an area that you lived?  Leave a comment and let me know. We Built This City is a 1985 song written by Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf, and originally recorded by US rock group Starship and released as their debut single on their album Knee Deep in the Hoopla. Commercially, the single reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the United States, the top 10 in Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland, the top 20 in Belgium, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and number 21 in Austria and the Netherlands. It has appeared on several “worst song” lists, topping a 2011 Rolling Stone poll of worst songs of the 1980’s by a wide margin. What exists of a narrative in the song consists of an argument between the singers (Mickey Thomas and Grace Slick) and an unidentified “you”, presumably a music industry executive, who is marginalizing the band and ripping them off by “playing corporation games” (“who counts the money underneath the bar?”). In response to this injustice, the singers remind the villain of their importance and fame: “Listen to the radio! Don’t you remember? We built this city on rock and roll!” A spoken-word interlude explicitly mentions the Golden Gate Bridge and refers to “the city by the bay”, a common moniker for Starship’s hometown of San Francisco; Starship’s predecessors, Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, were prominent members of San Francisco’s psychedelic rock scene in the late 1960’s and into the 1970’s. However, the interlude then rapidly refers to the same city as “the city that rocks”, a reference to Cleveland, Ohio (home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum), and then “the city that never sleeps”, one of the nicknames for New York City. Capitalizing on the ambiguity, several radio stations added descriptions of their own local areas when they broadcast the song, or even simply added their own indent in its place. Mickey Thomas joined joined Jefferson Starship in 1979. Mickey’s voice had become legendary after recording “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” with the Elvin Bishop Band and he was planning to pursue a solo career. Jefferson Starship quickly proved to be the right decision as they recorded their first hit, “Jane”, almost immediately after getting together. In 1985, Starship released the album that would come to define the eighties, Knee Deep in the Hoopla. Featuring two #1 hits – “We Built this City” and “Sara” – the album reached #7 on Billboard and went platinum. Starship followed- up their initial success with another #1 single, “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” featured on the soundtrack for Mannequin. As Starship continued to reach the top of the charts, MTV infiltrated pop culture and the band released videos for all of their hits that are still popular today. Starship music is featured in the soundtracks for “Rock of Ages,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Skeleton Twins,” and most recently on the popular TV series “Glee”. Starship is on tour now, delighting audiences around the world. I agree – music is amazing for that.  Now I just wish I could remember where I put my keys! 🙂 I was 7 and I remember the song very well. I didn’t realize they also sang Sara and the song from the movie Mannequin. Great 80s hits indeed! It’s fun to find out new details about different bands, and songs. 🙂 Seeing this reminded me of another one of their songs “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” which was from the movie Mannequin. I watched that movie so much as a kid and had such a crush on Andrew McCarthy. I don’t remember this song it may have been before my time lol. Nothing like some good nostalgia! Of Course I remember, how could I forget?  I love this song.  This section of your blog always has the most interesting of posts.  Old songs will never run out so I look forward to reading these often!",,,,,,,,,
which action by the state of maryland led to mcculloch v. maryland,"McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the Bank of the United States. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution.","17 U.S. 316 (1819); a landmark United States Supreme Court decision.  In this case, the state of Maryland attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable, the U.S. Bank was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law is generally recognized as specifically targeting the U.S. Bank. The Court invoked the Elastic Clause in the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers as long as those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers. 17 U.S. 316 McCulloch v. Maryland Congress has power to incorporate a bank. The Act of the 10th of April, 1816, ch. 44, to ""incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States"" is a law made in pursuance of the Constitution. The Government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action, and its laws, when made in pursuance of the Constitution, form the supreme law of the land. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States similar to the Articles of Confederation, which exclude incidental or implied powers. If the end be legitimate, and within the scope of the Constitution, all the means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may constitutionally be employed to carry it into effect. The power of establishing a corporation is not a distinct sovereign power or end of Government, but only the means of carrying into effect other powers which are sovereign. Whenever it becomes an appropriate means of exercising any of the powers given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union, it may be exercised by that Government. If a certain means to carry into effect of any of the powers expressly given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union be an appropriate measure, not prohibited by the Constitution, the degree of its necessity is a question of legislative discretion, not of judicial cognizance. The Bank of the United States has, constitutionally, a right to establish its branches or offices of discount and deposit within any state. The State within which such branch may be established cannot, without violating the Constitution, tax that branch. The State governments have no right to tax any of the constitutional means employed by the Government of the Union to execute its constitutional powers. The States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burthen, or in any manner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into effect the powers vested in the national Government. This principle does not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the Bank of the United States in common with the other real property in a particular state, nor to a tax imposed on the proprietary interest which the citizens of that State may hold in this institution, in common with other property of the same description throughout the State. This was an action of debt, brought by the defendant in error, John James, who sued as well for himself as for the State of Maryland, in the County Court of Baltimore County, in the said State, against the plaintiff in error, McCulloch, to recover certain penalties, under the act of the Legislature of Maryland hereafter mentioned. Judgment being rendered against the plaintiff in error, upon the following statement of facts agreed and submitted to the court by the parties, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland, the highest court of law of said State, and the cause was brought by writ of error to this Court. It is admitted by the parties in this cause, by their counsel, that there was passed, on the 10th day of April, 1816, by the Congress of the United States, an act entitled, ""an act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States;"" and that there was passed on the 11th day of February, 1818, by the General Assembly of Maryland, an act, entitled, ""an act to impose a tax on all banks, or branches thereof, in the State of Maryland, not chartered by the legislature,"" [p318] which said acts are made part of this Statement, and it is agreed, may be read from the statute books in which they are respectively printed. It is further admitted that the President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, incorporated by the act of Congress aforesaid, did organize themselves, and go into full operation, in the City of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, in pursuance of the said act, and that they did on the ___ day of _____ 1817, establish a branch of the said bank, or an office of discount and deposit, in the City of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, which has, from that time until the first day of May 1818, ever since transacted and carried on business as a bank, or office of discount and deposit, and as a branch of the said Bank of the United States, by issuing bank notes and discounting promissory notes, and performing other operations usual and customary for banks to do and perform, under the authority and by the direction of the said President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, established at Philadelphia as aforesaid. It is further admitted that the said President, directors and company of the said bank had no authority to establish the said branch, or office of discount and deposit, at the City of Baltimore, from the State of Maryland, otherwise than the said State having adopted the Constitution of the United States and composing one of the States of the Union. It is further admitted that James William McCulloch, the defendant below, being the cashier of the said branch, or office of discount and [p319] deposit did, on the several days set forth in the declaration in this cause, issue the said respective bank notes therein described, from the said branch or office, to a certain George Williams, in the City of Baltimore, in part payment of a promissory note of the said Williams, discounted by the said branch or office, which said respective bank notes were not, nor was either of them, so issued on stamped paper in the manner prescribed by the act of assembly aforesaid. It is further admitted that the said President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, and the said branch, or office of discount and deposit have not, nor has either of them, paid in advance, or otherwise, the sum of $15,000, to the Treasurer of the Western Shore, for the use of the State of Maryland, before the issuing of the said notes, or any of them, nor since those periods. And it is further admitted that the Treasurer of the Western Shore of Maryland, under the direction of the Governor and Council of the said State, was ready, and offered to deliver to the said President, directors and company of the said bank, and to the said branch, or office of discount and deposit, stamped paper of the kind and denomination required and described in the said act of assembly. The question submitted to the Court for their decision in this case is as to the validity of the said act of the General Assembly of Maryland on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress aforesaid, or to one of them. Upon the foregoing statement of facts and the pleadings in this cause (all errors in [p320] which are hereby agreed to be mutually released), if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then judgment, it is agreed, shall be entered for the plaintiffs for $2,500 and costs of suit. B ut if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover upon the statement and pleadings aforesaid, then judgment of non pros shall be entered, with costs to the defendant. It is agreed that either party may appeal from the decision of the County Court to the Court of Appeals, and from the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States, according to the modes and usages of law, and have the same benefit of this statement of facts in the same manner as could be had if a jury had been sworn and impanneled in this cause and a special verdict had been found, or these facts had appeared and been stated in an exception taken to the opinion of the Court, and the Court's direction to the jury thereon.
