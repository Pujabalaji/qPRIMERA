who was the man who stood in front of a tank,"Tank Man (also known as the Unknown Protester or Unknown Rebel) is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the Chinese military had suppressed the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and seen worldwide. There were only a few sources who caught the incident on tape.","This will be an interesting look at history. On this Day, Interesting Histories, Mysteries of History and more… June 5th 1989 was the day during the Tiananmen Square protests that a man, now referred to as ‘Tank Man’, stepped in the path of an advancing column of tanks. The man delayed the tank’s for over an hour. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank’s attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and shown worldwide. The event occurred the day after protestors had been violently suppressed by Chinese force, known as the Tiananmen Square massacre. This has become an iconic image in world history from a time of terror in China. The man in the picture is still unknown to this day despite being the centre of such a high profile situation, what happened to the crew of the tank is also unknown. China during this time was a dangerous and militaristic country and with what occurred the day before it would be believable to think the man and even the tank crew were killed in the aftermath.

After killing a trainer in Kingsport, Tennessee, she was hanged in nearby Erwin, Tennessee, in 1916. Her death is sometimes interpreted as a cautionary tale of circus animal abuse during the early 20th century. On September 11, 1916, a homeless man named Red Eldridge, who landed a job as a transient hotel clerk was hired as an assistant elephant trainer by the Sparks World Famous Shows circus. He was killed by Mary in Sullivan County, Tennessee, on the evening of September 12. Eldridge led the elephant parade, although he was not qualified, riding on the top of Mary’s back; Mary was the star of the show, riding at the front. There have been several accounts of his death. One, recounted by W.H. Coleman, who claimed to be a witness, is that he prodded her behind the ear with a hook after she reached down to nibble on a watermelon rind. She went into a rage, snatched Eldridge with her trunk, threw him against a drink stand and stepped on his head, crushing it. “collided its trunk vice-like about [Eldridge’s ] body, lifted him 10 feet in the air, then dashed him with fury to the ground… and with the full force of her beastly fury is said to have sunk her giant tusks entirely through his body. The animal then trampled the dying form of Eldridge as if seeking a murderous triumph, then with a sudden… swing of her massive foot hurled his body into the crowd.” It is clear from the photo of her hanging that Mary was either tuskless or had short ‘tushes’ common amongst female Asian elephants. The details of the aftermath are confused in a maze of sensationalist newspaper stories and folklore. Most accounts indicate that she calmed down afterward and didn’t charge the onlookers, who began chanting, “Kill the elephant! Let’s kill it.” Within minutes, local blacksmith Hench Cox tried to kill Mary, firing five rounds with little effect. Meanwhile, the leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included. The circus owner, Charlie Sparks, reluctantly decided that the only way to quickly resolve the potentially ruinous situation was to kill the wounded elephant in public. On the following day, a foggy and rainy September 13, 1916, Mary was transported by rail to Erwin , Unicoi County, Tennessee, where a crowd of over 2,500 people (including most of the town’s children) assemb led in the Clinchfield Railroad yard. The elephant was hanged by the neck from a railcar-mounted industrial crane between four o’clock and five o’clock that evening. The first attempt resulted in a snapped chain, causing Mary to fall and break her hip as dozens of children fled in terror. The severely wounded elephant died during a second attempt and was buried beside the tracks. A veterinarian examined Mary after the hanging and determined that she had a severely infected tooth in the precise spot where Red Eldridge had prodded her. Although the authenticity of a widely distributed (and heavily retouched) photo of her death was disputed years later by Argosy magazine, other photographs taken during the incident confirm its provenance. I think Mary was treated appallingly and those that killed her should have been punished for such a heinous act . However in 1916  the world was a very different place and many folks had strange primitive attitude towards animals and animal welfare. Thankfully we now live in a more enlighten time and we are way to busy killing each other to execute our fella animals.

See: palacebarracksmemorialgarden.co.uk for more details and memorials A British Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Officer approaches a suspect device at the junction of Manor Street and Oldpark Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Manor Street marked the line between protestant and catholic neighbourhoods. The quotation on the sign on the building to the left is from the Old Testament (Amos 4:12) and it reads: Probably the most discouraging thing to possibly read before approaching something that may or may not blow you to pieces. What is even more morbid is that the technician pictured is already within the “kill” radius for an explosive of that size. Fortunately, the technician in this photo did not lose his life, the bomb did not explode. The Ammunition Technicians of the Royal Logistic Corps became highly experienced in bomb disposal, after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and other groups. The bombs employed by the PIRA ranged from simple pipe bombs to sophisticated victim-triggered devices and infra-red switches. The roadside bomb was in use by PIRA from the early 1970s onwards, evolving over time with different types of explosives and triggers. Improvised mortars were also developed by the IRA, usually placed in static vehicles, with self-destruct mechanisms. During the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland, 23 British ATO bomb disposal specialists were killed in action. The EOD squad who served in Northern Ireland pioneered gears and tactics. For example the first EOD robot was made from a wheelchair stolen from a hospital and a various pulleys and some bits of wood. Also they were first to use the protective suit. The EOD suit only protects from the shrapnel that is ejected by an explosive device, it does not prevent the technician from being killed by the pressure wave produced by a large explosion. The issue is that the bomb suit stops fragmentation injuries, but explosive force doesn’t care about the suit. Either the explosive force hits you without it and you haemorrhage and die, or it hits the suit and the suit hits you and you haemorrhage and die. It’s useful, but for smaller pipe – bombs, grenades, and small IED objects. Bomb disposal is the process by which hazardous explosive devices are rendered safe. Bomb disposal is an all-encompassing term to describe the separate, but interrelated functions in the military fields of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and improvised explosive device disposal (IEDD), and the public safety roles of public safety bomb disposal (PSBD) and the bomb squad. The Ammunition Technicians of the Royal Logistic Corps (formerly RAOC) became highly experienced in bomb disposal, after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and other groups. The bombs employed by the PIRA ranged from simple pipe bombs to sophisticated victim-triggered devices and infrared switches. The roadside bomb was in use by PIRA from the early 1970s onwards, evolving over time with different types of explosives and triggers. Improvised mortars were also developed by the IRA, usually placed in static vehicles, with self-destruct mechanisms. During the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland, 23 British ATO bomb disposal specialists were killed in action. A specialist Army unit, 321 EOD Unit (later 321 EOD Company, and now part of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC), was deployed to tackle increased IRA violence and willingness to use bombs against both economic and military targets. The unit’s radio call-sign was Felix. Many  believe this to be an allusion to the cat with nine lives and led to the phrase “Fetch Felix” whenever a suspect device was encountered, which later became the title of the 1981 book Fetch Felix. However, the real reason could be either of two possibilities. All units in Northern Ireland had a callsign to be used over the radios. 321 Company, a newly formed unit, didn’t have such a callsign, so a young signaller was sent to the OC of 321 Coy. The OC, having lost two technicians that morning, decided on “Phoenix“. This was misheard as “Felix” by the signaller and was never changed. The other possible reason is that the callsign for RAOC was “Rickshaw”; however, the 321 EOD felt it needed its own callsign, hence the deliberate choice of “Felix the Cat with nine lives”. 321 Coy RAOC (now 321 EOD Sqn RLC) is unique in that it is the most decorated unit (in peace time) in the British Army with over 200 gallantry awards, notably for acts of great bravery during Operation Banner (1969–2007) in Northern Ireland. British Ammunition Technicians of 11 EOD Regiment RLC were requested by the US Forces commanders to operate in support of the US Marine Corps in clearing the Iraqi oilfields of booby traps and were among the first British service personnel sent into Iraq in 2003 prior to the actual ground invasion.

The photograph was published a week later in Life magazine, among many photographs of celebrations around the United States that were presented in a twelve-page section titled “Victory Celebrations”. A two-page spread faces three other kissing poses among celebrators in Washington, D.C.; Kansas City; and Miami opposite Eisenstaedt’s, which was given a full-page display. Kissing was a favorite pose encouraged by media photographers of service personnel during the war, but Eisenstaedt was photographing a spontaneous event that occurred in Times Square soon before the announcement of the end of the war on Japan was made by U.S. President Harry S. Truman at seven o’clock. Similar jubilation spread quickly with the news. Because he was photographing rapidly changing events during the celebrations, Eisenstaedt did not have an opportunity to get the names and details.  The photograph does not clearly show the face of either person involved, and numerous people have claimed to be the subjects. The photograph was shot just south of 45th Street looking north from a location where Broadway and Seventh Avenue converge. Soon afterward, throngs of people crowded into the square and it became a sea of people. The photograph was taken at 5:51 p.m. ET, according to Donald W. Olson and his team. It was taken with a Leica IIIa. In two different books he wrote, Alfred Eisenstaedt gave two slightly different accounts of taking the photograph and of its nature. In Times Square on V.J. Day I saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight. Whether she was a grandmother, stout, thin, old, didn’t make a difference. I was running ahead of him with my Leica looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me. Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse. If she had been dressed in a dark dress I would never have taken the picture. If the sailor had worn a white uniform, the same. I took exactly four pictures. It was done within a few seconds. Only one is right, on account of the balance. In the others the emphasis is wrong — the sailor on the left side is either too small or too tall. People tell me that when I am in heaven they will remember this picture. I was walking through the crowds on V-J Day, looking for pictures. I noticed a sailor coming my way. He was grabbing every female he could find and kissing them all — young girls and old ladies alike. Then I noticed the nurse, standing in that enormous crowd. I focused on her, and just as I’d hoped, the sailor came along, grabbed the nurse, and bent down to kiss her. Now if this girl hadn’t been a nurse, if she’d been dressed dark clothes, I wouldn’t have had a picture. The contrast between her white dress and the sailor’s dark uniform gives the photograph its extra impact. U.S. Navy photo journalistVictor Jorgensen captured another view of the same scene, which was published in the New York Times the following day. Jorgensen titled his photograph Kissing the War Goodbye. It shows less of Times Square in the background, lacking the characteristic view of the complex intersection so that the location needs to be identified, it is dark and shows few details of the main subjects, and it does not show the lower legs and feet of the subjects. Unlike the Eisenstaedt photograph, which is protected by copyright, this Navy photograph is in the public domain as it was produced by a federal government employee on official duty. While the angle of the photograph may be less interesting than that of Eisenstaedt’s photo, it clearly shows the actual location of the iconic kiss occurring in the front of the Chemical Bank and Trust building, with the Walgreens pharmacy signage on the building façade visible in the background. The surprised woman on the left in Jorgensen’s photograph has been positively identified as Kay Hughes Dorius of Utah. Edith Shain wrote to Eisenstaedt in the late 1970s claiming to be the woman in the picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor’s Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought she might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject. Since the identity of the woman had been claimed, in its August 1980 issue, the editors of Life asked that the kissing sailor come forward. In the October 1980 issue, the editors reported that eleven men and three women had come forward claiming to be the subjects of the photograph. Listed in the October 1980 issue as claiming to be the woman were Greta Friedman and Barbara Sokol as well as Edith Shain. On June 20, 2010, Shain died at age 91 of liver cancer.In April 2012 the issue of who the woman was, remained, as a new book on the topic was about to be released. The authors, George Galdorisi and Lawrence Verria, stated that Shain could not have been the woman because her height of just four feet ten inches was insufficient in comparison with the height of any of the men claiming to be the sailor. Galdorisi and Verria used interviews of claimants, expert photo analysis, identifying people in the background and consultations with forensic anthropologists and facial recognition specialists. They concluded that the woman was Greta Zimmer Friedman and that she was wearing her dental hygienist uniform in the photograph. “It wasn’t my choice to be kissed,” Friedman stated in a 2005 interview with the Library of Congress. “The guy just came over and grabbed!” she said, adding, “That man was very strong. I wasn’t kissing him. He was kissing me.”  “I did not see him approaching, and before I know it I was in this tight grip,” Friedman told CBS News in 2012. Friedman died at age 92 on September 8, 2016, in Richmond, Virginia, due to health complications of old age. Numerous men have claimed to be the sailor, including Donald Bonsack, John Edmonson, Wallace C. Fowler, Clarence “Bud” Harding, Walker Irving, James Kearney, Marvin Kingsburg, Arthur Leask, George Mendonça, Jack Russell, and Bill Swicegood. The issue regarding the identity of the kissers is no longer contended in a court of law. George Mendonsa of Newport, Rhode Island, on leave from the USS The Sullivans (DD-537), was watching a movie with his future wife, Rita, at Radio City Music Hall when the doors opened and people started screaming the war was over. George and Rita joined the partying on the street, but when they could not get into the packed bars decided to walk down the street. It was then that George saw a woman in a white dress walk by and took her into his arms and kissed her, “I had quite a few drinks that day and I considered her one of the troops—she was a nurse.” In one of the four pictures that Eisenstaedt took, Mendonsa claims that Rita is visible in the background behind the kissing couple. In 1987, George Mendonsa filed a lawsuit against Time Inc. in Rhode Island state court, alleging that he was the sailor in the photograph and that both Time and Life had violated his right of publicity by using the photograph without his permission. After Time Inc. removed the case to federal court, Mendonsa survived a motion to dismiss. Mendonsa was identified by a team of volunteers from the Naval War College in August 2005 as “the kisser”. His claim was based on matching his scars and tattoos to scars and tattoos in the photograph. They made their determination after much study including photographic analysis by the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who were able to match scars and tattoo spotted by photograph experts, and the testimony of Richard M. Benson, a photograph analysis expert, professor of photographic studies, plus the former Dean of the School of Arts at Yale University. Benson stated that “it is therefore my opinion, based upon a reasonable degree of certainty, that George Mendonsa is the sailor in Mr. Eisenstaedt’s famous photograph.” The identity of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa’s account of the events of the day, the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows in the photographs suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, whose hour hand appears closer to the 6 o’clock position than to the 2 o’clock position; and to Victor Jorgensen’s account of the circumstances of his own picture; concluding that Mendonsa’s version of events is untenable. Carl Muscarello is a retired police officer with the New York City Police Department, now living in Plantation, Florida. In 1995, he claimed to be the kissing sailor. He claimed that he was in Times Square on August 14, 1945, and that he kissed numerous women. A distinctive birthmark on his hand enabled his mother to identify him as the subject. Edith Shain initially said she believed Muscarello’s claim to be the sailor and they even dated after their brief reunion. But in 2005, Shain was much less certain, telling the New York Times, “I can’t say he isn’t. I just can’t say he is. There is no way to tell.” Muscarello has described his condition on August 14, 1945 as being quite drunk and having no clear memory of his actions in the square, stating that his mother claimed he was the man after seeing the photograph and he came to believe it. Glenn McDuffie laid claim in 2007 and was supported by Houston Police Department forensic artist Lois Gibson. Gibson’s forensic analysis compared the Eisenstaedt photographs with current-day photographs of McDuffie, analyzing key facial features identical on both sets. She measured his ears, facial bones, hairline, wrist, knuckles, and hand, and compared those to enlargements of Eisenstaedt’s picture. I could tell just in general that yes, it’s him. But I wanted to be able to tell other people so I replicated the pose. In the August 14, 2007, issue of AM New York McDuffie said he passed five polygraph tests confirming his claim to be the man. McDuffie, a native of Kannapolis, North Carolina, who had lied about his age so he could enlist at the age of 15, went on after the war to play semi-pro baseball and work for the United States Postal Service. He says that on that day he was on the subway to Brooklyn to visit his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield. He came out of the subway at Times Square, where people were celebrating in the streets. Excited that his brother, who was being held by the Japanese as a prisoner of war, would be released, McDuffie began hollering and jumping up and down. A nurse saw him, and opened her arms to him. In apparent conflict with Eisenstaedt’s recollections of the event, McDuffie said he ran over to her and kissed her for a long time so that Eisenstaedt could take the photograph: I went over there and kissed her and saw a man running at us…I thought it was a jealous husband or boyfriend coming to poke me in the eyes. I looked up and saw he was taking the picture and I kissed her as long as took for him to take it. Gibson had also analyzed photographs of other men who have claimed to be the sailor, including Muscarello and Mendonça, reporting that neither man’s facial bones or other features match those of the sailor in the photograph. On August 3, 2008, Glenn McDuffie was recognized for his 81st birthday as the “Kissing Sailor” during the seventh-inning stretch of the Houston Astros and New York Mets game at Minute Maid Park.[citation needed] McDuffie died on March 14, 2014. Life‘s October 1980 issue did not include Muscarello or Glenn McDuffie. These claims have been made much more recently. Mendonça and Friedman (both individually and together), as well as Shain, Muscarello, and McDuffie, were widely interviewed in the succeeding years by Life, PBS, NBC, CBS, and others. The life stories of Mendonça and Friedman, and how they came to be in Times Square that day, as well as the reasons they are considered most likely to be the ones photographed, are the subject of a detailed book on the photo. Mendonça recognizes Friedman, to the exclusion of any other woman, as the “nurse” he kissed in the photographs (or, to be precise, the woman in the white uniform, as Friedman was a dental assistant—a nurse’s uniform was customary in a dentist’s office to be worn by female assistants and hygienists in that era). As part of a World War II memorial at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts, a new painting titled Victory Kiss by Jim Laurier of New Hampshire was first unveiled on August 24, 2013, to honor the event captured in the photo. George Mendonça was in attendance for the unveiling. In 2005, John Seward Johnson II displayed a bronze life-size sculpture, Unconditional Surrender, at an August 14, 2005, sixtieth-anniversary reenactment at Times Square of the kiss. His statue was featured in a ceremony that included Carl Muscarello and Edith Shain, holding a copy of the famous photograph, as participants. Johnson also sculpted a 25-foot-tall (7.6 m) version in plastic and aluminum, which has been displayed in several cities, including San Diego and Sarasota.The 25-foot (7.6 m) version was moved to New York City again on August 12, 2015, for a temporary display. In the 2009 film Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, two characters jump into a life-size enlargement of the photograph, finding themselves in a monochrome Times Square. One of them cuts in on the sailor for a kiss with the nurse. In the 2009 film Watchmen, during the opening credits, the Times Square V-J celebration is shown with a costumed heroine, Silhouette, kissing a female nurse as a photographer captures the moment. In 2009 a furor over the placement of a derivative of the photograph on public land arose in Sarasota, Florida. Television and radio programs concentrated on it, and letters to the editor were printed for months. Letters and articles in the local press continue to debate the central issue of the objections in 2015. The statue was given ten years to stay on the public land by a slim majority of city council members. In the 2010 film Letters to Juliet, the photograph is featured in a scene where a magazine editor questions a writer about her fact-checking regarding the image. In the The Simpsons episode “Bart the General“, victory celebrations following a “war” between two groups of children include a boy in a sailor outfit kissing Lisa as a photograph is taken. She then slaps the boy, exclaiming, “Knock it off!” In 2012, while performing a show for the Marines during the New York City Fleet Week, singer Katy Perry kissed a man on stage, replicating the pose. In the 2012 film Men in Black III, a time traveling character views The Kiss. In the 2014 video game Wolfenstein: The New Order, an alternative history version of the V-J Day kiss (V-A Day in the timeline) appears as a Nazi soldier forcing himself on the nurse.

He was one of the most highly experienced and well-qualified candidates accepted into the Group Air Force № 1(the first squad of cosmonauts of the USSR) . Komarov was declared medically unfit for training or spaceflight twice while he was in the program, but his perseverance and superior skills and his knowledge as an engineer allowed him to continue playing an active role. During his time at the Cosmonaut Training Center, he contributed to space vehicle design, cosmonaut training and evaluation and public relations. He was eventually selected to command the first Soviet multiman Voskhod 1 spaceflight that presented a number of technical innovations in the Space Race. Komarov was later chosen for the rigorous task of commanding Soyuz 1 as part of the Soviet Union‘s bid to reach the Moon first. His spaceflight on Soyuz 1 made him the first Soviet cosmonaut to fly into outer space more than once, and he became the first human to die on a space mission—he was killed when the Soyuz 1 space capsule crashed after re-entry on 24 April 1967 due to a parachute failure. However, because he died when the capsule crashed into the ground, he is not considered to be the first human fatality in outer space. Komarov was born in Moscow on 16 March 1927, where he grew up along with his sister Matilde. His father was a labourer who worked at various low-paid jobs to support the family. In 1935, Komarov began his formal education in the local elementary school. Here he showed a natural aptitude for mathematics. In 1941, Komarov left school because of World War II, and the German invasion of the U.S.S.R., and he became a laborer on a collective farm. He showed an interest in aeronautics from an early age, and he collected magazines and pictures about aviation, in addition to making model aircraft and his own propeller. At the age of fifteen in 1942, Komarov entered the “1st Moscow Special Air Force School” to pursue his dream of becoming an aviator. Shortly thereafter, his family learned that Komarov’s father had been killed in an “unknown war action.” Of necessity because of the German invasion, the flight school was soon moved to the Tyumen Region in Siberia for the duration of the war. Students there learned a wide variety of subjects besides aviation – including zoology and foreign languages. In 1945, Komarov graduated from flight school with honors. Hostilities ended in World War II before Komarov was called on to enter combat. In 1946, Komarov completed his first year of training at the Chkalov Higher Air Force School in Borisoglebsk in Voronezh Oblast. He then completed his training at the A.K. Serov Military Aviation College in Bataisk. Komarov’s mother died in 1948, seven months before his graduation (in 1949) at which he received his pilots wings and commission as a lieutenant in the Soviet Air Force. In December 1949, Komarov served as the pilot of a fighter plane with the 383rd Regiment of the 42nd North Caucasian Fighter Air Division that was based in Grozny. Komarov married Valentina Yakovlevna Kiselyova in October 1950. He was promoted to senior lieutenant in 1952, and he was later assigned as the chief pilot of the 486th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 279th Fighter Air Division in the Prikarpate Region. Komarov continued to fly in that position until 1954, and then he enrolled in an engineering course at the N.E. Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. In 1959, Komarov was promoted to the rank of senior engineer-lieutenant. Later that year he achieved his goal of becoming a test pilot at the Central Scientific Research Institute at Chkalovsky. In September 1959, Komarov was promoted to engineer-captain and invited to participate in the selection process for cosmonaut candidate along with approximately 3,000 other pilots.[4] He was one of only twenty candidates selected for “Air Force Group One”, he and the others reported to the newly formed TsPK just outside Moscow for assignment on 13 March 1960. Although eminently qualified, Komarov was not chosen in the top six candidates, because he did not meet the age, height and weight restrictions specified by the “Chief Designer” of Russia’s space program: Sergei Korolev. “If the criteria had been different,” the cosmonaut trainer Mark Gallai noted in an interview, “certainly Komarov, who was very intelligent, would have been in the group. He had Air Force Academy flight experience. He had a great influence on the design of the Vostok and [the] Voskhod.” At age 32, Komarov was the second oldest of the pilots chosen – Sergei Korolev had specified a maximum age of just 27. Of the first intake, only two members, Pavel Belyayev (of Voskhod 2) and Komarov, were also graduates of the Soviet Air Force Academy. In addition, of the intake, only Komarov had experience as a flight test engineer on new aircraft. Shortly after beginning his training Komarov was hospitalised for a minor operation in May 1960, which left him medically unfit for physical training for approximately 6 months. At the time, the selection criteria placed a heavy emphasis on the physical condition of cosmonauts and any imperfection led to instant disqualification. Since Komarov already held engineering qualifications, he was allowed to remain a part of the program after assuring the administration he would be able to catch up. He continued with the required academic studies while recovering. He returned to training in October, because his recovery was more rapid than medical staff had expected. During that time he assisted his younger peers with their academic studies; earning him the casual nickname of “The Professor” which he shared with Belyayev who was two years his senior. In 1961 the first space flights began. By 1962, Komarov was the third highest paid cosmonaut, due to his qualifications, rank and experience. He earned 528 rubles a month, with only cosmonauts 1 and 2 Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov being more highly paid. When Georgi Shonin demonstrated an unacceptable level of g-force susceptibility in the centrifuge he was replaced by Komarov in May 1962 for planned dual Vostok missions. Komarov was selected as back up for Pavel Popovich (Vostok 4), but subsequent routine ECG testing of Komarov revealed a heart irregularity and he was pulled from the program and replaced by Boris Volynov. The same heart irregularity grounded American astronaut Deke Slayton. After Komarov persistently lobbied medical and military personnel to be readmitted into the program he was allowed to return to training. In 1963, cosmonaut training was conducted in 6 Groups, with Komarov being selected in Group 2 with Valery Bykovsky and Volynov.  This group was to train for missions of up to five days in duration scheduled for the latter part of 1963. In May 1963 Alekseyev proposed to Kamanin that Komarov be named backup for Vostok 5 rather than Khrunov because his suit was ready. Komarov was later named in a further group for planned missions in 1964 with Belyaev, Shonin, Khrunov, Zaikin, Gorbatko, Volynov, and Leonov. The training groups were formed for later Vostok missions, (Vostok 7–13) but no actual crews were assigned and the missions did not occur under the auspices of the original Vostok program. In December 1963, Komarov was shortlisted for flight by Kamanin with Volynov and Leonov, having completed two years of training. In April 1964 Komarov was declared space-flight ready with Bykovsky, Popovich, Titov, Volynov, Leonov, Khrunov, Belyayev, and Lev Demin. From this group the commander of the planned Voskhod mission scheduled for late 1964 would be chosen. In May the group was reduced to Volynov, Komarov, Leonov, Khrunov. During training, Komarov lived at the TsPK (which would later be nicknamed Star City by the Soviet press) with his wife Valentina and their two children Yevgeny and Irina. There he enjoyed hunting, cross country skiing, ice hockey and other social activities with his fellow trainees in their leisure time. Komarov was well liked by his peers and was referred to by them as Volodya (a diminutive of his first name). Pavel Popovich noted that Komarov was respected for his humility and experience: “…he was already an engineer when he joined us, but he never looked down on the others. He was warm-hearted, purposeful and industrious. Volodya’s prestige was so high that people came to him to discuss all questions: personal as well as questions of our work.” Fellow cosmonaut Alexei Leonov described him as “…very serious. He was a first-class test pilot.” By July 1964, only seven cosmonauts remained eligible for the Voskhod crew after some of them had been disqualified on medical grounds. On 6 July, Komarov was named as the commander of the back-up crew for Voskhod 1. After much heated debate over several months about the selection of the crew between Nikolai Kamanin and Sergei Korolev, Komarov was named as prime crew commander on 4 October 1964, by the State Commission;  just eight days before its scheduled launch. Kamanin played tennis with the Voskhod crew that evening and noted that Komarov played poorly in comparison to his crew: Boris Yegorov and Konstantin Feoktistov. On 9 October, Komarov and the crew inspected the Voskhod with Korolev and other members of the administration. Later that day they were interviewed by the state press and played tennis for the benefit of photographers. On the morning of 11 October, Komarov was given various communist relics to take with him into space the following day. In the afternoon the crew again inspected the capsule and were given their final instructions by Korolev. Komarov was the only member of the crew to have undertaken extensive training and was the only member with any flight experience; the two other crewmen being civilians. His call sign was “Ruby” (Russian: Рубин). During the mission Komarov performed various tasks with the other crew members, including medical and navigational tests and observing the Aurora Borealis. He also made a number of radio transmissions, including a greeting to the Tokyo Olympics which had opened on 10 October. Some of the transmissions Komarov made were recorded by amateur radio operators like Sven Grahn. The mission lasted just over twenty-four hours. After the crew landed safely they were flown back to the launch site at Tyuratam (also known as Baikonur to disguise its true location). Kamanin noted in his diary that while his crew were in good spirits, Komarov was fatigued. On 19 October, Komarov and his crew made reports in Red Square and attended an audience at the Kremlin. After the success of this short but scientifically important mission he was promoted to colonel. The success of the mission earned Komarov the awards of the Order of Lenin and Hero of the Soviet Union. In December 1964, the RSVN (Strategic Rocket Forces) requested that Komarov be transferred from the VVS (Soviet Air Force) to the RSVN, in a move possibly motivated by the poor record of the RSVN in producing successful rockets compared to the VVS. The request was opposed by Kamanin. In 1965, Komarov worked with Yuri Gagarin in supervising preparations for the flight of Voskhod 2, which carried out the first attempt of an extravehicular activity in outer space. These preparations included fitting of space suits on the cosmonauts and briefings for the spaceflight. In April of that year, Komarov toured St. Petersburg, Russia, with Kamanin, Gagarin, Gherman Titov, Belyayev, and Leonov, and Komarov visited Petropavlovsk Fortress with Valentin Glushko where he had conducted the first rocket experiments in the early 1930s. In September that year, Komarov toured West Germany. Komarov was assigned to the Soviet Soyuz program along with Yuri Gagarin and Alexei Leonov. In July 1966, Komarov was reprimanded by Kamanin for his unauthorised disclosure, while in Japan, that “the Soviet Union will, at the scheduled time, fly an automated spacecraft around the Moon and return it to (the) Earth, to be followed by a dog flight, then a manned circumlunar flight.” The following month Komarov clashed with other engineers over ongoing design problems in which zero-G tests showed that the Soyuz module hatch was too small to allow the exit of a fully suited cosmonaut safely. Meanwhile, Komarov and his fellow cosmonauts had their groups and assignments constantly revised and they became increasingly anxious about the lack of response to their concerns about the design and manufacture of space craft which had been raised in a letter to Leonid Brezhnev by Yuri Gagarin on their behalf. Komarov was selected to command the Soyuz 1, in 1967, with Yuri Gagarin as his backup cosmonaut. During the preparations for the spaceflight, both cosmonauts were working twelve- to fourteen-hour days. On orbital insertion, the solar panels of the Soyuz module failed to fully deploy thereby preventing the craft from being fully powered and obscuring some of the navigation equipment. Komarov reported: “Conditions are poor. The cabin parameters are normal, but the left solar panel didn’t deploy. The electrical bus is at only 13 to 14 amperes. The HF (high frequency) communications are not working. I cannot orient the spacecraft to the sun. I tried orienting the spacecraft manually using the DO-1 orientation engines, but the pressure remaining on the DO-1 has gone down to 180.” Komarov tried unsuccessfully to orient the Soyuz module for five hours. The craft was transmitting unreliable status information and communications were lost on orbits 13 through 15 due to the failure of the high frequency transmitter which would have maintained radio contact while the craft was out of range of the ultra-high frequency (UHF) receivers on the ground. As a result of the problems with the craft, the second Soyuz module which was to have carried cosmonauts to perform an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) to the Soyuz 1 was not launched and the mission was cut short. Komarov was ordered to re-orient the craft using the ion system on orbits 15 to 17. The ion engine system failed. Komarov did not have enough time to attempt a manual re-entry until orbit 19. Manual orientation relied on using the equipped Vzor device, but in order to do this, Komarov needed to be able to see the Sun. To reach the designated landing site at Orsk the retro-fire would need to take place on the night side of the Earth. Komarov oriented the spacecraft manually on the dayside then used the gyro-platform as a reference so that he could orient the craft for a night side retro-fire. He successfully re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere on his 19th orbit, but the module’s drogue and main braking parachute failed to deploy correctly and the module crashed into the ground, killing Komarov. According to the 1998 book Starman, by Jamie Doran and Piers Bizony, as Komarov sped towards his death, U.S. listening posts in Turkey picked up transmissions of him crying in rage, “cursing the people who had put him inside a botched spaceship.” On 25 April, a response to Komarov’s death by his fellow cosmonauts was published in Pravda: “For the forerunners it is always more difficult. They tread the unknown paths and these paths are not straight, they have sharp turns, surprises and dangers. But anyone who takes the pathway into orbit never wants to leave it. And no matter what difficulties or obstacles there are, they are never strong enough to deflect such a man from his chosen path. While his heart beats in his chest, a cosmonaut will always continue to challenge the universe. Vladimir Komarov was one of the first on this treacherous path.” When interviewed on 17 May by the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, Yuri Gagarin alluded to the failure of the administration to listen to the concerns about the Soyuz module that were identified by the cosmonaut corps and that Komarov’s death should teach the establishment to be more rigorous in its testing and evaluation of “all the mechanisms of the spaceship, even more attentive to all stages of checking and testing, even more vigilant in our encounter with the unknown. He has shown us how dangerous the pathway to space is. His flight and his death will teach us courage.” In May 1967, Gagarin and Leonov criticised program head Vasily Mishin‘s “poor knowledge of the Soyuz spacecraft and the details of its operation, his lack of cooperation in working with the cosmonauts in flight and training activities” and asked Kamanin for him to be cited in the official report into the crash. After Komarov’s death, the communications systems on board all Soviet spacecraft were modified because Komarov’s voice transmissions from Soyuz 1 had blocked its telemetry signals. “He was our friend. Before his death the press and public had paid little attention to the extreme risks we took.” On 26 April 1967, Komarov was given a state funeral in Moscow, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square. The American astronauts requested the Soviet government to allow a representative to attend, but were turned down. Komarov was posthumously awarded his second Order of Lenin and also the Order of Hero of the Soviet Union. Kamanin noted in his diary that over 10,000 people were present at this service, “some driving hundreds of kilometres for the event.” Komarov has been featured on commemorative First Day Covers and stamps for his contribution to the space program – from several different countries. Komarov is commemorated with other prominent figures from the early Russian space program with a bust on Cosmonauts Alley in Moscow, and he is also honored with a monument at the crash site near Orsk. Before leaving the Moon on Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong‘s final task was to place a small package of memorial items to honor Komarov, Yuri Gagarin, and the Apollo 1 astronauts Virgil Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee. Komarov’s name also appears on a commemorative plaque left at Hadley Rille on the Moon by the commander of Apollo 15, David Scott in memory of 14 deceased NASA astronauts and USSR cosmonauts, along with a small sculpture entitled Fallen Astronaut, on 1 August 1971. This plaque and the sculpture represent those astronauts and cosmonauts who died in the quest to reach outer space and the Moon. The asteroid 1836 Komarov, discovered in 1971, was named in the honor of Komarov, as was a crater on the Moon.[35] This asteroid and the cosmonaut inspired the composer Brett Dean to write a piece of symphonic music commissioned by conductor Simon Rattle in 2006. The composition is named Komarov’s Fall, and it can be found on the EMI Classics Album of Simon Rattle’s The Planets. Among other honors, the Vladimir M. Komarov Astronautical Rocketry Club (ARK) in Ljubljana has also borne Komarov’s name since 1969. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale‘s V.M. Komarov Diploma is named in Komarov’s honor. There was formerly a Soviet satellite-tracking ship named for Komarov, the Kosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. The Estonian band Sõpruse Puiestee (Friendship Boulevard) wrote a song “Planeetidegi vahel kehtib raskus” (“Difficulty stands even between planets”) in honor of Komarov. This recording was completed 43 years after Komarov’s death, on 24 April 2010. The French electro band named Kowalsky wrote a song “Lost” (2008) in honor of Komarov, in which the listener can hear his last words. The American progressive metal band Cormorant wrote a song “Unearthly Dreamings” (2011) about Komarov’s failed space mission. Mehmet Baydur, a Turkish playwright who died on 24 November 2001, wrote a play titled Vladmir Komarov about what happened on his last day, 24 April 1967. The Finnish band This Empty Flow wrote a song called “Towards Distant (the death of Komarov during re-entry).” It includes a broadcast message made by Komarov during the Soyuz 1 flight Valentina Komarov, the widow of Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov, kisses a photograph of her dead husband during his official funeral, held in Moscow’s Red Square on April 26, 1967.

AP photojournalist Horst Faas took this iconic photo on June 18, 1965, during the Vietnam War with the 173rd Airborne Brigade Battalion on defense duty at Phouc Vinh airstrip in South Vietnam. The headband message “War is Hell” typified an acerbic attitude of many young American soldiers who were likely drafted and sent to the remote southeastern Asia jungles to engage in deadly and terrifying combat. A lot of the soldiers wrote graffiti on their helmets with inscriptions of their attitudes about where they were and why they were there. The contrast is what makes this photo iconic. You have this, bright, young handsome soldier with a smile on his face and then you have the text on his helmet. Take the helmet out, and this could easily be a high school yearbook photo. His face betrays a sense of innocence, but when you look at his helmet, you can tell that he is anything but. You know that he has witnessed the horrors of war firsthand and is trying to cover it all up on the outside. The identity of the soldier was unknown for many decades until recently when he was identified as Larry Wayne Chaffin from St. Louis. He served with that brigade in Vietnam for exactly one year beginning in May 1965 and when the photo was taken he was 19. Chaffin had many problems adjusting to civilian life when he returned from Vietnam. He died at the age of 39 from complications that arose from diabetes, an ailment he might have contracted from exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. He died in 1985. The “War is Hell” quote originates from William Tecumseh Sherman’ address to the graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy (19 June 1879); but slightly varying accounts of this speech have been published. Sherman was a Union Army general during the American Civil War. He succeeded General U.S. Grant as commander of the Western Theatre of that war in the spring of 1864. “I’ve been where you are now and I know just how you feel. It’s entirely natural that there should beat in the breast of every one of you a hope and desire that some day you can use the skill you have acquired here. Suppress it! You don’t know the horrible aspects of war. I’ve been through two wars and I know. I’ve seen cities and homes in ashes. I’ve seen thousands of men lying on the ground, their dead faces looking up at the skies. I tell you, War is Hell!“. (Photo credit: Associated Press Photos). Horst Faas (28 April 1933 – 10 May 2012) was a Germanphoto-journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner. He is best known for his images of the Vietnam War. Born in Berlin, Germany, Faas began his photographic career in 1951 with the Keystone Agency, and by the age of 21 he was already covering major events concerning Indochina, including the peace negotiations in Geneva in 1954. In 1956 he joined the Associated Press (AP), where he acquired a reputation for being an unflinching hard-news war photographer, covering the wars in Vietnam and Laos, as well as in the Congo and Algeria. In 1962, he became AP’s chief photographer for Southeast Asia, and was based in Saigon until 1974. His images of the Vietnam War won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1965. In 1967 he was severely wounded in the legs by a rocket-propelled grenade. In 1972, he collected a second Pulitzer, for his coverage of the conflict in Bangladesh. Inside Bangladesh, photographer Rashid Talukder considered it too dangerous to publish his photographs and he released them more than twenty years after Horst’s photographs had appeared. Faas is also famed for his work as a picture editor, and was instrumental in ensuring the publication of two of the most famous images of the Vietnam War. The notorious “Saigon Execution” photograph, showing the summary execution of a Viet Cong prisoner by Saigon police chief Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, taken by Eddie Adams in Saigon on February 1, 1968 was sent under his direction. Nick Ut‘s famous “Napalm Girl” photograph caused a huge controversy over at the AP bureau; an editor had objected to the photo, saying that the girl depicted was naked and that nobody would accept it. Faas ordered that Ut’s photo be sent over the wire. In September 1990, freelance photographer Greg Marinovich submitted a series of graphic photos of a crowd executing a man to the AP bureau in Johannesburg. Once again, AP editors were uncertain if the photos should be sent over the wire. One editor sent the images to Faas, who telegrammed back, “send all photos.” In 1976, Faas moved to London as AP’s senior photo editor for Europe; he retired in 2004. In retirement he organised reunions of the wartime Saigon press corps and ran international photojournalism symposiums. He produced four books on his career and other news photographers, including Requiem, a book about photographers killed on both sides of the Vietnam War, co-edited with fellow Vietnam War photojournalist Tim Page. In 2012 the subject of his iconic photo (a soldier at Phouc Vinh airstrip) is claimed to be Larry Wayne Chaffin, a soldier with the 173rd Airborne Brigade Battalion, who was on defence duty (18 June 1965) during the Vietnam War.

Since Japanese coastal defense guns were firing at the plane while it was in the water during take-off, this brave young man, after rescuing the pilot, manned his position as machine gunner without taking time to put on his clothes. A hero photographed right after he’d completed his heroic act. Naked. Photo taken by Horace Bristol (1908-1997). In 1941, Bristol was recruited to the U.S. Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, as one of six photographers under the command of Captain Edward J. Steichen, documenting World War II in places such as South Africa, and Japan. He ended up being on the plane the gunner was serving on, which was used to rescue people from Rabaul Bay (New Britain Island, Papua New Guinea), when this occurred. In an article from a December 2002 issue of B&W magazine he remembers: “…we got a call to pick up an airman who was down in the Bay. The Japanese were shooting at him from the island, and when they saw us they started shooting at us. The man who was shot down was temporarily blinded, so one of our crew stripped off his clothes and jumped in to bring him aboard. He couldn’t have swum very well wearing his boots and clothes. As soon as we could, we took off. We weren’t waiting around for anybody to put on formal clothes. We were being shot at and wanted to get the hell out of there. The naked man got back into his position at his gun in the blister of the plane.” The identity of the gunner has never been established . Horace Bristol (November 16, 1908 – August 4, 1997) was a twentieth-century American photographer, best known for his work in Life. His photos appeared in Time, Fortune, Sunset, and National Geographic magazines. Bristol was born and raised in Whittier, California, and attended the Art Center of Los Angeles, originally majoring in architecture. In 1933, he moved to San Francisco to work in commercial photography, and met Ansel Adams, who lived near his studio. Through his friendship with Adams, he met Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, and other artists. He was copy reader at night for the Los Angeles Times after graduating from Belmont High School. In 1936, Bristol became a part of Life‘s founding photographers, and in 1938, began to document migrant farmers in California’s central valley with John Steinbeck, recording the Great Depression, photographs that would later be called the Grapes of Wrath collection. In 1941, Bristol was recruited to the U.S. Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, as one of six photographers under the command of Captain Edward J. Steichen,  documenting World War II in places such as South Africa, and Japan. Bristol helped to document the invasions of North Africa, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Following his documentation of World War II, Bristol settled in Tokyo, Japan, selling his photographs to magazines in Europe and the United States, and becoming the Asian correspondent to Fortune. He published several books, and established the East-West Photo Agency. Following the death of his wife in 1956, Bristol burned all his negatives, packed his photographs into storage, and retired from photography. He went on to remarry, and have two children. He returned to the United States, and after 30 years, recovered the photographs from storage, to share with his family. Subsequently he approached his alma mater, Art Center College of Design, where the World War II and migrant worker photographs became the subject of a 1989 solo exhibition. The migrant worker photos would go on to be part of the J. Paul Getty Museum‘s Grapes of Wrath series. Bristol lived in Ojai, California, until his death in 1997 at the age of 89. Bristol’s work is displayed around the world, including the Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2006, a documentary was made, The Compassionate Eye: Horace Bristol, Photojournalist, written and directed by David Rabinovitch.

He committed self-immolation as a political protest against the end of the Prague Spring resulting from the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact armies. In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the liberalising reforms of Alexander Dubček‘s government during what was known as the Prague Spring. Prague-born Palach decided to sacrifice himself in protest of the invasion and set himself on fire, in Wenceslas Square, on 16 January 1969. According to a letter he sent to several public figures, an entire clandestine resistance organization had been established with the purpose of practicing self-immolation until their demands were met; however, it seems that such a group never existed.[1] The demands declared in the letter were the abolition of censorship and a halt to the distribution of Zprávy, the official newspaper of the Soviet occupying forces. In addition, the letter called for the Czech and the Slovak peoples to go on a general strike in support of these demands.[2] An earlier draft of the letter that Palach wrote also called for the resignation of a number of pro-Soviet politicians,[3] but that demand did not make it into the final version, which included the remark that “our demands are not extreme, on the contrary”. Palach died from his burns several days after his act, at the hospital. On his deathbed, he was visited by a female acquaintance from his college and by a student leader, to whom he had addressed one of the copies of his letter. It was reported that he had pleaded for others not to do what he had done but instead to continue the struggle by other means, although it has been doubted whether he really said that.[4] According to Jaroslava Moserová, a burns specialist who was the first to provide care to Palach at the Charles University Faculty Hospital, Palach did not set himself on fire to protest against the Soviet occupation, but did so to protest against the “demoralization” of Czechoslovak citizens caused by the occupation. The funeral of Palach turned into a major protest against the occupation, and a month later (on 25 February 1969) another student, Jan Zajíc, burned himself to death in the same place, followed in April of the same year by Evžen Plocek in Jihlava. Palach was initially interred in Olšany Cemetery. As his gravesite was growing into a national shrine, the Czechoslovak secret police (StB) set out to destroy any memory of Palach’s deed and exhumed his remains on the night of 25 October 1973. His body was then cremated and sent to his mother in Palach’s native town of Všetaty while an anonymous old woman from a rest home was laid in the grave.[6] Palach’s mother was not allowed to deposit the urn in the local cemetery until 1974. On 25 October 1990 the urn was officially returned to its initial site in Prague. On the 20th anniversary of Palach’s death, protests ostensibly in memory of Palach (but intended as criticism of the regime) escalated into what would be called “Palach Week”. The series of anticommunist demonstrations in Prague between 15 and 21 January 1989 were suppressed by the police, who beat demonstrators and used water cannons, often catching passers-by in the fray. Palach Week is considered one of the catalyst demonstrations which preceded the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia 10 months later.[citation needed] After the Velvet Revolution, Palach (along with Zajíc) was commemorated in Prague by a bronze cross embedded at the spot where he fell outside the National Museum, as well as a square named in his honour. The Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek, who left Czechoslovakia the following year, named an asteroid which had been discovered on 22 August 1969, after Jan Palach (1834 Palach). There are several other memorials to Palach in cities throughout Europe, including a small memorial inside the glacier tunnels beneath the Jungfraujoch in Switzerland. Several later incidents of self-immolation may have been influenced by the example of Palach and his media popularity. In the spring of 2003, a total of six young Czechs burned themselves to death,[7] notably Zdeněk Adamec, a 19-year-old student from Humpolec who burned himself on 6 March 2003 on almost the same spot in front of the National Museum where Palach burnt himself, leaving a suicide note explicitly referring to Palach and the others who had committed suicide in the 1969 Prague Spring.[8]) Just walking distance from the site of Palach’s self-immolation, a statuary in Prague’s Old Town Square honours iconic Bohemian religious thinker Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1415. Himself celebrated as a national hero for many centuries, some commentary has linked Palach’s self-immolation to the execution of Hus.[9][10][11] The music video for the song “Club Foot” by the band Kasabian is dedicated to Palach. The composition “The Funeral of Jan Palach” performed by The Zippo Band and composed by Phil Kline is a tribute. He is mentioned in The Stranglers‘ bassist, Jean-Jacques Burnel‘s 1979 solo album, Euroman Cometh. After seeking political asylum in the United States, Polish artist Wiktor Szostalo commemorated Jan Palach in his “Performance for Freedom” proclaiming “I am Jan Palach. I’m a Czech, I’m a Pole, a Lithuanian, a Vietnamese, an Afghani, a betrayed You. After I’ve burnt myself a thousand times, perhaps we’ll win”.[12] On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, a statue sculpted by András Beck as a tribute to the student was transported from France to the Czech Republic. The statue was installed in Mělník, the city where Jan Palach did his studies.[13] Italian songwriter Francesco Guccini wrote a song “La Primavera di Praga” in dedication to Jan Palach, compared to religious scholar Jan Hus: “Once again Jan Hus is burning alive”. Polish singer Jacek Kaczmarski wrote a song about Palach’s suicide, called “Pochodnie” (“Torches”). The Italian far-right Folk group, ”La Compagnia dell’Anello” released a song dedicated to him, titled Jan Palach. The Kasabian, British band, released the “Club Foot” on their 2004 debut album Kasabian on 17 May 2004 in the UK. The video of this song is dedicated to Jan Palach. The Luxembourg-based Welsh composer Dafydd Bullock was commissioned to write “Requiem for Jan Palach” (op 182) to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of Palach’s suicide. It includes a setting of words which appeared briefly on a statue in Wenceslas Square after the event, before being erased by the authorities: “Do not be indifferent to the day when the light of the future was carried forward by a burning body”.[14] In their 1983 song “Nuuj Helde” the Janse Bagge Bend (from the Netherlands) asks whether people know why Jan Palach burned. This song was meant to make the general public aware of heroes. Palach featured in a monologue radio play entitled “Torch No 1” on BBC Radio 4, directed by Martin Jenkins, and written by David Pownall. Palach was played by Karl Davies.[15] French documentary filmmaker Raymond Depardon directed a 1969 film about Jan Palach. Norwegian songwriter Hans Rotmo mentioned Palach’s name among other notable political activists such as Victor Jara and Steve Biko in his 1989 song “Lennon Street”. Norwegian songwriter and singer Åge Aleksandersen mentioned Palach’s name in his 1984 song “Va det du Jesus”. A sequence of poems exploring the implications of Palach’s death called One Match by the poet Sheila Hamilton were published in issue 51 of the Dorset-based poetry serial, Tears in the Fence (ed. David Caddy) in 2010. A three-part 2013 Czech-Polish television show “Burning Bush“, directed by Agnieszka Holland, is situated around the events that happened after Jan Palach’s self-immolation. American Metal band Lamb of God wrote a song on their studio album VII: Sturm und Drang, entitled “Torches”, that was inspired by Palach’s actions.[citation needed] In the Czech republic, many towns have streets or squares named after Palach, of which perhaps most notable is the Jan Palach Square in central Prague. He also had streets named after him in Luxembourg city (Luxembourg), Angers and Parthenay (France), Kraków (Poland), Assen and Haarlem (Netherlands), Varna (Bulgaria) and Nantwich (United Kingdom). In Rome (Italy) (as well as in many other Italian towns), there is a central square named after Palach with a commemorative statue. The oldest rock club in Croatia is named Palach. It is situated in Rijeka since 1969 to this day. There is a bus station in the town of Curepipe, Mauritius named after Jan Palach. A student hall in Venice, Italy on the Giudecca island has also been given the name of Jan Palach.

As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank’s attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and seen worldwide. Currently, there is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the tank man. 1989 Raw Video: Man vs. Chinese tank Tiananmen Square The incident took place near Tiananmen on Chang’an Avenue, which runs east-west along the north end of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, on June 5, 1989, one day after the Chinese government’s violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests.[4] The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags, one in each hand.[5] As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with his bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action.[6] After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse. Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver’s hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank’s turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner’s hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on. At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff. Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.[6] Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, said it was the Chinese government PSB (Public Security Bureau),[7] while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, Time included the “Unknown Rebel” in a feature titled Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century.[8] Little is publicly known of the man’s identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid the Sunday Express named him as Wang Weilin (王维林), a 19-year-old student[9] who was later charged with “political hooliganism” and “attempting to subvert members of the People’s Liberation Army.”[10] However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights.[11] One party member was quoted as saying, “We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison.”[11] Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man’s identity and current whereabouts.[12] There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President’s Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, reported that he was executed 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.[6] In Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have “no idea who he was either” and that he’s still alive somewhere on the mainland. The government of the People’s Republic of China has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), “I can’t confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,” and then replied in English, “I think…never killed” [sic].[13] At the time, the party’s propaganda apparatus referred to the incident as showing the “humanity” of the country’s military.[14] In a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Jiang Zemin said, “He was never arrested.” He then stated, “I don’t know where he is now.” He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.[15] Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989[11][16] and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of the 20th century.[1][2][3] However, a PBS interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.[17] Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China.[11] When undergraduate students at Beijing University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they “were genuinely mystified.”[18] One of the students said that the image was “artwork.” It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man, that he whispered to the student next to him “89”–which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event. It has been suggested that the “Unknown Rebel,” if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.[11] At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.[19] Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.[20] On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.[16] The widest coverage of the event, and one of the best-known photographs of the event, appearing in both Time and Life magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.[20] The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about half a mile (800 meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter.[21] With Widener running out of film, a friend hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.[22] Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world[20] and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.[22] Wider shot by Stuart Franklin showing column of tanks. Charlie Cole, working for Newsweek and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to Newsweek.[20] Franklin won a World Press Award for a similar photo.[23] It was featured in Life‍‍ ’​‍s “100 Photographs That Changed the World” in 2003. On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter Terril Jones revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.[24] Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,[25] but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.[20] It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener’s work, they re-checked Wah’s negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener’s. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A “foreign” photographer accompanying him suddenly said, “I am not gonna die for your country,” and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.[25] In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the world. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua and CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer appear to be the only two television cameramen who captured the scene.[26][27] ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony.[28] After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the “tank man” incident occurred.[19][29] Stuart Franklin (born London, 16 June 1956[1]) is a photographer, a member of Magnum Photos, and a former President of Magnum Photos (2006–2009).[2] He was born at Guys Hospital, London. Franklin studied drawing under Leonard McComb in Oxford and Whitechapel, London, and from 1976–1979 photography at West Surrey College of Art and Design, where he graduated with a BA. Moreover, between 1995 and 1997, he studied geography at the University of Oxford, first receiving a BA and the Gibbs Prize for geography. He received a doctorate in Geography from the University of Oxford in 2000.[1] From 1980 until 1985, Franklin worked with Agence Presse Sygma in Paris. During that time he photographed the civil war in Lebanon, unemployed people in Britain, famine in Sudan and the Heysel Stadium disaster. Joining Magnum Photos in 1985,[2] he became a full member in 1989. In the same year, Franklin photographed the uprising in Tiananmen Square and shot one of the Tank Man photographs, first published in Time Magazine, as well as widely documenting the uprising in Beijing [3][4] earning him a World Press Photo Award. In 1989 Franklin traveled with Greenpeace to Antarctica. He worked on about twenty stories for National Geographic between 1991 and 2009, subjects including Inca conqueror Francisco Pizarro and the hydro-struggle in Quebec and places such as Buenos Aires and Malaysia.[1] In addition, he worked on book and cultural projects. In October 2008, his book Footprint: Our Landscape in Flux was published by Thames & Hudson. An ominous photographic document of Europe’s changing landscape, it highlights Franklin’s deep ecological concern. During 2009 Franklin curated an exhibition on Gaza – “Point of No Return” for the Noorderlicht Photo Festival. Since 2009 Franklin has focused on a long term landscape project in Norway published as “Narcissus” in 2013. Recently Franklin has worked on documentary projects on doctors working in Syria, and immigration in Calais. He leads a programme in documentary photography at Høgskulen i Volda, Norway.

Earthrise is a photograph of the Earth taken by astronaut William Anders in 1968, during the Apollo 8 mission. Nature photographer Galen Rowell declared it “the most influential environmental photograph ever taken.”[1] This had been preceded by the crude 1966 black-and-white raster earthrise image taken by the Lunar Earthrise is the name given to NASA image AS8-14-2383, taken by astronaut William Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, the first manned voyage to orbit the Moon.[1][2] Initially, before Anders found a suitable 70 mm color film, mission commander Frank Borman took a black-and-white photograph[3] of the scene, with the Earth’s terminator touching the horizon. The land mass position and cloud patterns in this image are the same as those of the color photograph entitled Earthrise.[4] The photograph was taken from lunar orbit on December 24, 1968, with a highly modified Hasselblad 500 EL with an electric drive. The camera had a simple sighting ring rather than the standard reflex viewfinder and was loaded with a 70 mm film magazine containing custom Ektachrome film developed by Kodak. An audio recording of the event is available[5] with transcription[6] which allows the event to be followed closely – excerpt:[7] There were many images taken at that point. The mission audio tape establishes several photographs were taken, on Borman’s orders, with the enthusiastic concurrence of Lovell and Anders. Anders took the first color shot, then Lovell who notes the setting (1/250th of a second at f/11), followed by Anders with another two at varying exposures. A nearly full-page black and white reproduction of Borman’s image may be viewed on page 164 of his 1988 autobiography, captioned, “One of the most famous pictures in photographic history — taken after I grabbed the camera away from Bill Anders”. Borman was the mission commander and notes[8] (pg. 212) that this is the image “the Postal Service used on a stamp, and few photographs have been more frequently reproduced” [but see above]. The photograph reproduced in the Frank Borman autobiography is not the same image as the Anders photograph; aside from the orientation, the cloud patterns differ. The stamp issue reproduces the cloud, color, and crater patterns of the Anders picture. Anders is described (pg. 193) by Borman as holding “a masters degree in nuclear engineering”; Anders was thus tasked as “the scientific crew member … also performing the photography duties that would be so important to the Apollo crew who actually landed on the Moon”. In Life ‘s 100 Photographs that Changed the World, wilderness photographer Galen Rowell called Earthrise “the most influential environmental photograph ever taken.”[9] Another author called its appearance the beginning of the environmental movement.[10] U.S. postage stamp (Scott #1371) In 1969, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp (Scott # 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon. The stamp featured a detail (in color) of the Earthrise photograph, and the words, “In the beginning God…”, recalling the Apollo 8 Genesis reading. On April 6, 2008 (Japan Standard Time), the first 1080p high-definition Earthrise video was captured, both a full Earthrise and Earthset video, by the JAXA lunar orbiter mission, SELENE (better known in Japan by its nickname Kaguya). After successfully orbiting the Moon for 1 year and 8 months, it was crashed intentionally onto the lunar surface at 18:25 UTC on June 10, 2009.[11] Earthrise Revisited 2013, a recreation showing the rising Earth as it must have looked to Anders, Borman, and Lovell in 1968. In 2013, in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission, NASA issued a video about the taking of the photograph.[12] This computer-generated visualization used data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which had provided detailed images of the lunar surface that could be matched with those taken every 20 seconds by an automatic camera on Apollo 8. The resulting video, re-creating what the astronauts would have seen, was synchronized with the recording of the crew’s conversation as they became the first humans to witness an Earthrise. The video included explanatory narration written and read by Andrew Chaikin.[13] An earthrise that might be witnessed from the surface of the Moon would be quite unlike moonrises on Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, one side of the Moon always faces toward Earth. Interpretation of this fact would lead one to believe that the Earth’s position is fixed on the lunar sky and no earthrises can occur, however, the Moon librates slightly, which causes the Earth to draw a Lissajous figure on the sky. This figure fits inside a rectangle 15°48′ wide and 13°20′ high (in angular dimensions), while the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from Moon is only about 2°. This means that earthrises are visible near the edge of the Earth-observable surface of the Moon (about 20% of the surface). Since a full libration cycle takes about 27 days, earthrises are very slow, and it takes about 48 hours for Earth to clear its diameter.[14] During the course of the month-long lunar orbit, an observer would additionally witness a succession of “Earth phases”, much like the lunar phases seen from Earth. That is what accounts for the half-illuminated globe seen in the photograph. I’m no expert,  but I sincerely believe that we are not alone in the universe . I just find it inconceivable that out of these vast numbers our solar system is the only place that life took hold and evolved into the beautiful earth we know today. I’m no Expert . But I assume that every thing that was needed to create the conditions for life on earth were no doubt abundant throughout space during the birth and evolution  of space and the birth of Galaxies . I’m not saying that life is  abundant throughout our galaxy and the billions of  other galaxies out there , but surely the same elements that kick started life on earth must have travelled through space and found a home on other worlds out there. Unfortunately  due to the vast distances to these other worlds and galaxies we will never be able to travel to them or indeed send space ships and probes to unlock their secrets. I expect that most life forms out there are single cell and far below the complex life forms that are found on earth. The mind boggle….

After four days of harassment that threatened her safety, her parents forced her to withdraw from the school. In 1956, forty black students applied for transfers at a white school.  This was after the passing of the Pearsall Plan in North Carolina. At 15 years of age, on 4 September 1957, Dorothy Counts was one of the four black students enrolled at various all-white schools in the district; She was at Harry Harding High School, Charlotte, North Carolina. Three students were enrolled at other schools, including Central High School. The harassment started when the wife of John Z. Warlick, the leader of the White Citizens Council, urged the boys to “keep her out” and at the same time, implored the girls to spit on her, saying, “spit on her, girls, spit on her.” Dorothy walked by without reacting, but told the press that many people threw rocks at her—most of which landed in front of her feet—and that many spat on her back. Photographer Douglas Martin won the 1957 World Press Photo of the Year with an image of Counts being mocked by a crowd on her first day of school. More abuse followed that day. She had trash thrown at her while eating her dinner and the teachers ignored her. The following day, she befriended two white girls, but they soon drew back because of harassment from other classmates. Her family received threatening phone calls and after four days of extensive harassment—which included a smashed car and having her locker ransacked, her father decided to take his daughter out of the school.[1] At a press conference, he said: It is with compassion for our native land and love for our daughter Dorothy that we withdraw her as a student at Harding High School. As long as we felt she could be protected from bodily injury and insults within the school’s walls and upon the school premises, we were willing to grant her desire to study at Harding. The family moved to Pennsylvania, where Counts attended an integrated school in Philadelphia, and later earned a degree from Johnson C. Smith University. She has spent her professional career in child care resources. In 2008, Harding High School awarded Counts an honorary diploma. In 2010, Counts received a public apology from a member of the crowd which harassed her in 1957.[7] In 2010, Harding High School renamed its library in honor of Counts-Scoggins, an honour rarely bestowed upon living persons.

This error was generated by Mod_Security.,"As Southern Californians, we are fortunate to live in a region with unrivaled natural resources and beauty. Within a short walk or drive from our homes, we find a vast array of indigenous flora and fauna and a diverse tableau of microclimates. Yet for all the natural beauty that surrounds us, it is no surprise to learn that today’s children are spending increasingly less time outdoors playing and interacting with nature. A constant din of news reports laments increasing rates of childhood obesity, which has in fact doubled in the past 20 years. We hear mounting concerns over the adverse effects of overused technology. And according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children spend an astounding average of seven hours per day on entertainment media including TV, computers, phones and other electronic devices. In fact, from 1981 to 1997 children’s free playtime dropped 25%. Generation Z is expected to be the first generation to have a shorter lifespan than preceding generations. Anyone over 40 will reminisce about the days when kids played outside, unsupervised, until the street lights came on. Those days are certainly gone. But in spite of the cautionary tales of today’s children being overscheduled, stressed out and removed from the natural world, Millennials and Gen Z are actually far more environmentally aware and concerned then prior generations, which is hopeful. So we took a look around our own community and found inspiring stories of kids learning about nature and wildlife while very young, and teens translating that knowledge into action during young adulthood. Twin brothers Austin Nash and Brandon Nash developed a love of the wilderness and conservation as young boys while traveling to national parks with their parents. Experiencing firsthand the majestic beauty of these national treasures fostered an early and deep appreciation of nature in both brothers. As Brandon shares, “We realized how special those places are and how important it is to protect them. We wanted to get involved with conservation, and since we can’t go to national parks every weekend and we live in a beautiful peninsula, we realized there were opportunities to get involved in our own backyard.” A few years ago the Nash brothers, along with friends in their Los Hermanos volunteer group, participated in an event at White Point Nature Preserve organized by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy (PVPLC). Impressed by the overall event and especially the PVPLC team, the brothers were hooked and knew they had found the right volunteer organization for them. The experience was so positive, the brothers said the day went by in a blur and didn’t feel like work at all. They have continued volunteering with PVPLC at many events, but their favorite PVPLC program is Adopt a Plot. “We adopted a PVPLC plot at Agua Amarga Canyon in Rancho Palos Verdes,” explains Austin. “My brother and I lead a group of our friends from our Los Hermanos volunteer group. We, along with our friends, tend to our plot almost every weekend, though we do so more frequently in the summer months. In the area of our plot there were already some native plants in place. Our job is to take care of native plants, especially watering in dry months. And when it rains, then we’re weeding out invasive plants. Recently we planted four new baby willow trees in the plot. On our plot there is a riparian section with a seasonal stream with a square piece of land adjacent to it. We’ve planted native plants in a grid fashion for intense restoration of the natural habitat. Our plot keeps expanding.” Austin and Brandon are now part of the PVPLC Team Leader Program. “It’s more beneficial to the organization for us to help the volunteers instead of being another person pulling up weeds,” Austin says. “So when there is a larger-scale volunteer event—for example, recently for MLK day—I’ll work with the volunteer coordinator, and I’m assigned to an area and to lead a group of volunteers. I’m there to answer questions and to be working too, but also watching their work to ensure they’re not pulling out the wrong plants.” Brandon adds, “We did a Team Leader training to further our familiarity with native plants and how to operate the volunteer program. So we both work as team leaders on the volunteer days, which rotate between the different PVPLC preserves.” Through their volunteer work with PVPLC, Brandon and Austin have developed a variety of skills, seen tangible results of their efforts, honed their leadership capabilities and realized the value and satisfaction that comes with inspiring others to do good. What is perhaps even more significant: The Nash brothers credit their work with PVPLC with helping them discover their individual callings. Austin has found his true passion in science and plans to pursue a career in biology and environmental science. He has already attended two prestigious research field expeditions in Yosemite and the Galapagos Islands and is currently applying for spots in three expeditions, including one in Boulder and another in Antarctica. Austin and his friend Jonathan Wang founded a club at PVHS called the Green School Initiative, which educates and encourages its members to be more environmentally conscience citizens. It offers students who are passionate about being green a safe place to express that passion. The club also initiates ways for PVHS to make green changes on campus and improve its sustainability practices. Some of these changes include water refilling stations, using rain collection barrels and installing solar panels on campus. As a result of the Green School Initiative, PVHS was recently named a Green Ribbon School. Austin is also an avid nature photographer, and his work has won awards and been featured in photo exhibitions. Ultimately, he aspires to become a researcher or professor. Brandon has developed a passion for the business of conservation and aspires to pursue a career in an arena that will influence global policies for sustainability. Whether he ultimately works in the public or private sector, his dream is to develop a global standard supported by government and NGO entities that can slow and eventually stop climate change. In this pursuit, Brandon is taking science and business courses and is involved with PVHS Model U.N. to hone his policy-making skills. He believes if all entities get on board, we can truly effect change on a global scale. As part of Model U.N., Brandon created a website for the group. He is currently treasurer, and next year he will serve as secretary general. Austin’s and Brandon’s passion and activism have garnered many well-deserved honors and accolades, for which they are humbled and proud. Among these, the Nash brothers were chosen to be the keynote speakers at this year’s Palos Verdes Pastoral—the exclusive annual fundraising event to benefit the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy. Held at Terranea, the intimate, sold-out event welcomed 200 PVPLC top donors for a handcrafted, organic, chef-prepared, farm-to-table dinner. After the Nash brothers delivered their speech, they were approached by many attendees who thanked them for their dedication to protecting and enhancing Palos Verdes. Guests spoke of being inspired by the Nash brothers’ work and pleased to see that today’s youth are willing to take up the cause. Others expressed their pleasure in knowing their donations are being well utilized. “Teens get a bad rap,” Austin explains, “but the guests at the Pastoral—after hearing our speech and about the work we do—can take comfort that our generation will be the change they want to see.” Brandon adds, “We gave them hope.” Research shows a correlation between early exposure to nature and wildlife and an enhanced empathy, appreciation and respect for the natural world and all living beings. It is also thought that the earlier in one’s youth this exposure occurs, the more profound and enduring the connection to nature will be. Sunny Dallafior and her Traveling Nature Class are proof positive that creating a rapport between children and animals can have a meaningful and lasting effect. Miss Sunny, as kids fondly call her, shares her love of all creatures with groups of curious children in a hands-on, symbiotic and controlled environment. The Traveling Nature Class brings a menagerie of live animals into classrooms and other interactive settings, giving children an opportunity to see and touch a wide variety of unusual species while learning about the importance of our ecosystem and the unique role each living being plays in our world. One of the primary goals of the Traveling Nature Class is to teach children to respect animals and not to fear them. By understanding the unique characteristics and idiosyncrasies of individual species—while also learning how to safely and properly handle each animal—children broaden their appreciation for the animal kingdom and our remarkable planet. At each Traveling Nature Class, Sunny brings a wide variety of critters that are appropriate for the age group. Animals presented during a class may include hedgehogs, chinchillas, a ferret, longhaired rabbits, a miniature pig, bearded dragons, a tegu, skinks, an eclectus parrot, and a variety of frogs, snakes and lizards. Sunny can also customize her class to address specific scientific subjects currently being studied by a class such as invertebrates … humorously nicknamed The Bug Program. The Traveling Nature Class visits schools throughout Southern California. Based in the South Bay, Sunny conducts annual classes in several local schools. She also visits campuses as far away as Pasadena, Palmdale/Lancaster and throughout Orange County. Sunny primarily works with preschool and elementary school children, but middle and high schools also bring in her class. She also offers classes at local libraries and many private events. On the day we visited the Traveling Nature Class, Sunny was working in a Manhattan Beach preschool. With her guidance, the 3- to 4-year-old students were unafraid of these unusual (and often villainized) creatures. Many kids had snakes draped around their arms and shoulders, while lizards, frogs, chinchillas and bunnies rested calmly in other kids’ arms and laps. It is inspiring to see the unbridled enthusiasm and curiosity of these young children as they experience interacting with these unique animals up close. As Sunny explains, “The biggest benefit of our program is that we get kids interested in all living creatures. They learn to care about other beings and understand that we share this planet and that human actions can have an effect on other species. It changes their viewpoint and subsequent behavior and encourages them to appreciate nature and want to conserve our precious earth.” She goes on to say, “When working with children and animals, I’m often reminded of the famous Lorax quote: ‘Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.’” Much like the Traveling Nature Class teaches children about terrestrial and amphibious creatures, The SEA Lab in Redondo Beach—a marine education and science center—teaches kids about marine life and coastal conservation, also through a hands-on interactive experience. Located near the Redondo Harbor, The SEA Lab welcomes approximately 10,000 kids each year to its facility located steps away from the Pacific Ocean. At The SEA Lab, visitors can tour an exhibition on all things water—from osmosis to droughts to variations between saltwater and freshwater sea life. The facility has open tanks with a wide variety of local marine animals as well as aquariums with underwater ecosystems on display. Many children visiting The SEA Lab come on field trips from schools throughout the Southland, typically in groups of 60 to 75 students. Their visit is divided into three 45-minute activities, including a guided, hands-on tour of the facility where kids are able to touch sea animals; a beach exploration; and an instructional period specifically tailored to the grade level of the visiting students. According to The SEA Lab director Maria Madrigal, some groups of students come from inland schools. It’s not unusual for their trip to SEA Lab to be their first time seeing the ocean. In addition to field trips, homeschooled children visit The SEA Lab to meet their science curriculum. The SEA Lab also plays host to private events such as birthday parties. One of The SEA Lab’s more popular programs is summer camp, where kids can study and interact with marine science in a more in-depth, specialized educational program. Since 1997, The SEA Lab has been operated and managed by the Los Angeles Conservation Corps. The SEA Lab team includes four full-time staff members and dozens of local volunteers. As a part of the LA Conservation Corps, a group of 15 to 20 interns play a crucial role in handling the daily operations at The SEA Lab. The Corps interns are comprised mostly of college students pursuing careers in marine biology and other relevant fields of science. “Many of our interns choose to work at The SEA Lab because of a love of the ocean and sea life, along with a desire to work with children,” Maria shares. “They want to inspire future generations and teach them about respecting the ocean and the critical importance of conservation.” Numerous studies have shown that when a love of nature is imbued early in one’s youth—much like it was for Austin and Brandon—it often develops into a full-blown passion by young adulthood, inspiring more dedicated pursuit. The 515 students at Environmental Charter High School (ECHS) in Lawndale are emblematic of that passion. At ECHS and its two sister middle schools in Gardena and Inglewood, students opt out of attending a traditional public school to pursue a more academically challenging curriculum that utilizes the environment as a base to develop and enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills. ECHS offers students a rigorous college-prep curriculum, requiring each student to complete the A-G coursework required for acceptance into UC and CSU systems. Many students at ECHS aspire to continue their studies at universities offering degrees in environmental studies or to pursue green careers. Opened in 2000, Environmental Charter High School is the brainchild of founder and executive director Alison Suffet Diaz, an attorney-turned-teacher whose groundbreaking idea to start a charter school teaching academics through the prism of the environment came to her while working in the classroom. “When I was teaching,” Alison explains, “I discovered that if I could get kids to care about local issues and they in turn could see that they had the power to do something about those issues and be the change that they aspired to be, they were willing to do the work, put in the hours and take the classes needed to achieve their goals.” ECHS is a public high school serving grades 9–12. Like so many outstanding charter schools in LA and throughout California, there are far more students who desire to attend ECHS than there are eligible spots in the school. Thus admission to ECHS is offered through a lottery system. Each year approximately 300 students apply for 130 incoming freshman spots. There are typically between 100 to 150 students wait-listed to attend ECHS each year. The ECHS campus is often referred to as a “living textbook.” It is quite literally an outdoor classroom … a living, breathing science lab where students are engaged and empowered to implement their ideas for sustainability and see the tangible results of their green projects. Students feel responsible and invested in their school. ECHS proudly and enthusiastically offers student-guided tours of the campus. These tours are typically led by top students. The day of our tour we met Carolyn Lam, who fortuitously moved to California from Virginia in ninth grade and won the lottery to attend ECHS. Carolyn is a Green Ambassador and is currently writing her senior thesis on pollution. She won an Air Quality Management District Award for her work. At the entrance of ECHS is the amphitheatre, made of urbanite—recycled concrete taken from other locations on the campus. The urbanite was then broken into smaller pieces and placed strategically to create the welcoming student gathering area. On rainy days, the center of the campus would often flood. ECHS students came up with the idea to create a living stream to handle excess water flow when it’s raining and provide a source for conducting water experiments year-round. The school has a living wall and a solar-powered greenhouse. There are organic fruit trees spread throughout the campus that double as “seasonal snack machines,” where students can eat the fruit they want if it’s in season. Bunnies and chickens, cared for by students, roam the school. There is a cistern, rain collection barrels and swales, along with the dry riverbed to prevent excess runoff and recycle water more efficiently. ECHS promotes composting, recycling and minimizing waste. There are also systems in place to reduce electricity and water consumption. ECHS has an on-campus lab with 3-D printers where students are currently designing and building tiny homes and an on-campus, student-run store selling a variety of sustainable items. The school also has its own bike shop, of which the students are especially proud. At the shop, students are able to rent bikes for a minimal fee, and they are also encouraged to build and repair bikes—adding to their learning experience. ECHS is exceptionally proud of its Green Ambassador Program. Originally started to mentor and train its own students and staff, the program has now become a model for other green schools around the country and offers training and development to instructors from other schools through the Green Ambassador Program. Perhaps what is most outstanding about ECHS is its impressive graduation rates and its outstanding ability to prepare students for future success. Located in South LA, ECHS primarily educates children from underserved communities. More than 75% of the student body qualify for free or reduced-price meals, and the diverse makeup of the student population is approximately 68% Hispanic, 20% African American, 6% Asian and 4% Caucasian. Many of ECHS’ graduates are the first to graduate high school in their families. A notable 98% of ECHS graduating students have completed the required coursework for admission to a four-year university or college (the California statewide average is 35%). Approximately 78% of ECHS graduates go on to attend college. It is this extraordinary success in inspiring and educating children that has garnered ECHS numerous awards and accolades, including being named in the top 3% of U.S. public high schools by U.S. News & World Report, receiving a California Gold Ribbon School award and a National Green Ribbon School award and Green Leadership award, to name but a few. Alison, who also serves on the board of Green Schools National Network, is certainly proud of the numerous accolades the Environmental Charter Schools have received. Yet she sites that the most essential element to making the schools so effective is that they create a positive and collaborative learning environment. “Community is critical for the success of any school,” she says. “We are creating a family and a community in our schools. If you build a community and the kids feel a part of that, and the teachers feel supported and that they are making a difference—which they are … well then, that’s the magic.” Songs that give off superbloom energy.

Who took the video?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZXxfEcwkJ8 Ross Cowan Tim Veater you might be on to something about ugly old folk...ManageLikeShow more reactions · Reply · 9hTim VeaterTim Veater Victims must be photogenic it seems! On a somewhat more serious note, am I right in thinking you are a medically qualified doctor? The reason I pose this rather personal question (I hope you will not be offended) is that if I am correct you must be somewhat aware of standard post-death procedures, particularly following tragedy or homicide. There are many elements to the Florida School shooting that simply cannot be made to fit and reconcile the various accounts and yet the media appear totally oblivious of these and fail to pursue them. It is a brave and perhaps foolish man who would challenge the fact of 17 young lives lost, when in a small intimate community they must be well known and grieved over, so other than a sophisticated deception, we must accept these tragic deaths occurred. Nevertheless I cannot help noting the speed with which the crime scene containing muliple dead and injured was cleared and apparently re-opened, the necessary forensic post-mortems carried out, the funeral arrangements organised, all to allow at least two victims to be buried (Alyssa Alhadeff and Meadow Pollack according to the London Times) only two days after the event on the 16th February, 2018! This seems incredibly speedy but is it exceptional - even questionable? Other funerals took place the following Monday. I am sure you will have experience in this area and have an opinion and I would be most interested to hear it. Tim Veater Can I add a few further points/questions that trouble me, for your respected observations? It is claimed that Cruz had only 9 minutes in the building. In this time he entered the building carrying his gun and back pack unchallenged by anyone although he had been banned; set off the fire alarm; moved to the toilets where he unpacked his weapon and allegedly told others to leave as it ""was going to get messy"" yet again no one challenged him; he then started shooting into classrooms on the ground, first and second floors, apparently leaving weapon and back pack there. Then nonchallantly walked back down the stairs and out of the building chatting to an aquaintance who reports nothing untoward about him. (Incidentally this version clashes with the version that he entered and immediately ascended the staircase to the top floor) The Times reports he fired ""about 150"" bullets and that 120 were left in his back. This of course would require multiple reloading depending on the capacity of the magazine (up to 30) I suppose this might be just possible in the time available, but it clashes directly with the account that the shooting occurred when students RETURNED from the fire; or that shooting was happening as Cruz left with the friend; or the Hogg video claiming they were hiding in a class room date stamped four hours previous; or the fact that young people were still inside on 'lock-down' two hours AFTER the attack and Cruz was already under arrest! Tim Veater So we must assume that the dead and injured were left for about two hours before ""troops"" released them. Of the 17 taken to hospital, two allegedly died there, contributing to the total of 17 that died. This means that 15 died at the scene either inside or out, every one of which could not be moved until all the forensic evidence had been recorded. If carried out thoroughly and systematically this would be a time-consuming process carried out only by specially trained experts. Every one of the hundred and fifty bullets would have to be accounted for, logged and catalogued including trajectories, all of course photographed. Is there any evidence this was done? Tim Veater Then we come to the bodies themselves. Each the result of a despicable criminal act must have required detailed autopsy to determine cause of death and the description of the actual injuries inflicted. Who were the pathologists employed in this task, again very time consuming and following strict guidelines. Yet despite 17 of these, within less than two days, at least two victims were released and buried. In such a notorious case, wouldn't you expect the Coroner would wish to retain bodies until at least he was satisfied all due process had completed? Of course all this amazing speed of process is complimented by the speed with which Cruz is identified as the killer, located, arrested, hospitalised, arraigned and admits to the deed. Conversely, it contrasts with all outrageous failings of the FBI, Police and school authorities that allowed the massacre to take place.

(Get more Season 14 details.) The two chairs between Adam and Blake have been rotating since Season 4, but this bromantic duo has refused to give up their seats. Considering they are the only coaches to compete in every season, it is no surprise that Blake has won the most championships with six, followed by Adam with three. But is it finally time for these two to take a break? Or would “The Voice” hit the ultimate sour note without them? Vote in our poll below. For the first three seasons Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green held down the center chairs before both decided to take a hiatus. Usher and Shakira joined the panel for Season 4 and Season 6, with Christina coming back for Seasons 5, 8 and 10 and CeeLo returning only once more for Season 5. Other coaches to rotate through were Gwen Stefani (Seasons 7, 9 and 12), Pharrell Williams (Seasons 7-10), Miley Cyrus (Seasons 11 and 13), Alicia Keys (Seasons 11, 12 and 14), Jennifer Hudson (Season 13) and Kelly Clarkson (Season 14). In his 13 seasons as a coach, Blake has mentored the winning contestant nearly 50 percent of the time. His six title-holders were Jermaine Paul (Season 2), Cassadee Pope (Season 3), Danielle Bradbery (Season 4), Craig Wayne Boyd (Season 7), Sundance Head (Season 11) and Chloe Kohanski (Season 13). Adam’s three wins have come more sporadically after he coached the series’ first champion, Javier Colon (Season 1) followed by Tessanne Chin (Season 5) and Jordan Smith (Season 9).

It is based on the Dutch version which was created by John de Mol and is also a part of a wider international franchise. The show employs a board of four judges who critique the performances of the contestants. Each of them also has teams of their own that they are supposed to guide. The team consists of members they wish to select their students for the entire season. They compete to make sure that their team members win the competition and thus they are made the winning coach. The first season of The Voice aired on 6th June 2015. The judges for this season was renowned singers from the Bollywood industry like Mika Singh, Shaan, Himesh Reshammiya, and Sunidhi Chauhan who were also the coaches. The host was Karan Tacker who is a pretty famous face on the small screen. The format of the show had around three phases which included blind auditions as the first, battleground as the second and live performance shows as the final one. The stage of Blind Auditions was where the contestants were to sing in front of the judges and each coach could select around 14 candidates. If more than one coach selects the candidate, which was done only on the basis of the voice of the candidate, that person had the liberty to choose their coach. In the Battle Ground stage, the coaches had to develop their team members and train them in various ways. The coaches would have two members from their respective teams battling each other by singing the same song and then they had to choose who would move to the next level. Further, from the individual performances, they could select which member they wanted to take to the stage of a live show. Here the rest of the members had to perform solo and entertain the audience and judges. After four rounds, each coach could select contestants that would go to the semi-final round. In semi-finals, two members of each team would have a face-off and the winner among them would be decided on the basis of public votes and points given by judges. In the Finals, the winner is chosen amongst all the four contestants from each time which is on the results of the voting after the live performance. Coach Shaan was the winner of the season with his contestant Pawandeep Rajan who defeated Parampara Thakur, Deepesh Rahi, and Rishabh Chaturvedi in the finals. This season received many positive comments and was appreciated by the viewers a lot. Copyright © 2023 NetTV4u.com",,,,,,
every how many years do cicadas come out,"Magicicada species spend most of their 13-and 17-year lives underground feeding on xylem fluids from the roots of deciduous forest trees in the eastern United States. After 13 or 17 years, mature cicada nymphs emerge in the springtime at any given locality, synchronously and in tremendous numbers. After such a prolonged developmental phase, the adults are active for about 4 to 6 weeks. The males aggregate into chorus centers and attract mates. Within two months of the original emergence, the lifecycle is complete, the eggs have been laid, and the adult cicadas are gone for another 13 or 17 years.","Lawn insects in Tennessee can be troublesome for homeowners. Signs that your lawn may be infested with insects include patches of discolored grass, thinning or stunted growth, and yellow or brown patches. Common lawn insects in Tennessee include fire ants, armyworms, cutworms, yellow jackets, hunting billbugs, chinch bugs, white grubs, and more! Army worms are another destructive lawn insect found in Tennessee. They often feed on the leaves of grass and can quickly destroy a lawn if left untreated. Army worms are most active during the warmer months when they can be seen swarming in large numbers. Cutworms are similar to army worms, as they feed on the leaves of grass as well. They are nocturnal, so they usually come out at night and can be seen crawling around in search of food. Fortunately, both can also be controlled with insecticides or parasitic nematodes. Fire ants are considered one of the most common and destructive lawn insects in Tennessee. Fire ants have spread from the extreme southern states to the Mid-South, which includes Memphis. The Southern fire ant is aggressive, and its sting can produce reactions ranging from irritation and vomiting to even more severe symptoms. They attack both people and animals. It can cause damage to trees, shrubs, air-conditioning units, and even telephone wires. Therefore, it is important to take measures to control the fire ants on your lawn. Green June beetles look similar to Japanese Beetles and feed on the leaves of grass, leaving large dead spots. To control this insect, use an insecticide specifically designed for green June beetle larvae or apply beneficial nematodes to your lawn. Proper mowing practices can also help to reduce populations by removing their food source. Grubs are the larvae of beetles, and they feed on grassroots. They can cause considerable damage to your lawn if left unchecked, so it's important to take action as soon as you notice them. Regularly inspect your lawn for grubs in late summer or early fall, and apply an insecticide if necessary. Alternatively, natural predators such as birds and certain insects can be encouraged to visit your lawn to help keep the grub population in check. Finally, aerating and fertilizing your lawn regularly will help keep it healthy, making it less attractive to grubs. Hunting Billbugs are a species of beetle found in Memphis, TN. They have long bodies and pointed heads, and their shells are dark brown or black with yellowish-brown stripes. Hunting Billbugs feed on the roots of turfgrass and can cause extensive damage to lawns if left unchecked. To control them, use insecticides or baits specifically designed for beetles. You can also remove the adults by hand or use a vacuum cleaner to suck up any larvae. Be sure to dispose of them carefully, so they don't return to your yard. Leafhoppers and spittlebugs feed on the sap of grass blades, creating a frothy “spit” that protects them from predators. To reduce populations, introduce beneficial insects into your lawn and avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides. Proper mowing practices can also help to keep these insects away. Mole crickets can cause extensive damage to lawns, with their tunneling activities creating large dead spots. To reduce populations, use an insecticide specifically designed for mole crickets or apply beneficial nematodes to your lawn. You can also attract birds that feed on these insects and keep your grass mowed high to make it difficult for them to tunnel. Sod webworms can cause significant damage to lawns by creating patches of dead grass as they feed on the foliage. To reduce populations, introduce beneficial parasitic wasps into your lawn or use insecticides specifically designed for this insect. Additionally, avoid over-fertilizing your lawn and maintain proper soil moisture levels, as this can encourage the growth of webworms. Yellow Jackets are a large, aggressive species of wasp found in Memphis, TN. They are often mistaken for bees due to their yellow and black stripes, but they can be identified by their long bodies and pointed wings. Yellow Jackets have a painful sting and will aggressively defend their nests if disturbed. To control them, use insecticides or traps specifically designed for wasps. Chinch bugs are small insects that feed on turfgrass roots. They can cause extensive damage to lawns, turning the grass yellow and resulting in dead patches. To control them, use insecticides specifically designed for chinch bugs or neem oil. In addition, you can reduce their numbers by removing any thatch buildup in your lawn and maintaining adequate moisture levels in the soil. Mulching also helps to suppress chinch bug populations.",,,,,,,,,
where did the red velvet cake come from,"When foods were rationed during World War II, bakers used boiled beet juices to enhance the color of their cakes. Beets are found in some red velvet cake recipes, where they also serve to retain moisture. Adams Extract, a Texas company, is credited with bringing the red velvet cake to kitchens across America during the Great Depression era, by being one of the first to sell red food coloring and other flavor extracts with the use of point-of-sale posters and tear-off recipe cards. The cake and its original recipe are well known in the United States from New York City's famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which has dubbed the confection Waldorf-Astoria cake. However, it is widely considered a Southern recipe.

what are the causes of industrial revolution in england,"The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century. The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into cottage industry, for example weaving, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories. The colonial expansion of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors, as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.","The Industrial Revolution was a major shift of technological, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions that occurred in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in some Western countries. It began in Britain and spread throughout the world, a process that continues as industrialization. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human social history, comparable to the invention of farming or the rise of the first city-states; almost every aspect of daily life and human society was, eventually, in some way influenced by it. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the nineteenth century, eventually affecting most of the world. The impact of this change on society was enormous.[1] ""What caused the Industrial Revolution?"" remains the most important unanswered question in social science. The term ""Industrial Revolution"" applied to technological change was common in the 1830s. Louis-Auguste Blanqui in 1837 spoke of la révolution industrielle. Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of ""an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society."" The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen, between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the century. Credit for popularizing the term may be given to historian Arnold Toynbee, whose lectures given in 1881 gave a detailed account of the process.[7] The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and remain a topic for debate, with some historians seeing the Revolution as an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the seventeenth century. As national border controls became more effective, the spread of disease was lessened, therefore preventing the epidemics common in previous times. The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly, leading to a larger workforce. The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labor-intensive, forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into cottage industry, for example weaving, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories. The colonial expansion of the seventeenth century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors, as is the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. Technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.[8] The historian, Lewis Mumford has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the early Middle Ages, much earlier than most estimates. He explains that the model for standardized mass production was the printing press and that ""the archetypal model for the [industrial era] was the clock."" He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that Medieval cities had at their center a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronization necessary for later, more physical manifestations such as the steam engine. The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them.[9] Governments' grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system (the Statute of Monopolies 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialization are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewards inventors by allowing, e.g., James Watt to monopolize the production of the first steam engines, thereby enabling inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicizing ingenuity and rewarding inventors[10]. Watt's monopoly may have prevented other inventors, such as Richard Trevithick, William Murdoch or Jonathan Hornblower, from introducing improved steam engines thereby retarding the industrial revolution by up to 20 years[11]. One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution started in eighteenth century Europe and not in other parts of the world in the eighteenth century, particularly China, India, and the Middle East, or at other times like in Classical Antiquity[12] or the Middle Ages.[13] Numerous factors have been suggested, including ecology, government, and culture. Benjamin Elman argues that China was in a high level equilibrium trap in which the non-industrial methods were efficient enough to prevent use of industrial methods with high costs of capital. Kenneth Pomeranz, in the Great Divergence, argues that Europe and China were remarkably similar in 1700, and that the crucial differences which created the Industrial Revolution in Europe were sources of coal near manufacturing centers, and raw materials such as food and wood from the New World, which allowed Europe to expand economically in a way that China could not.[14] However, most historians contest the assertion that Europe and China were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on Western Europe in the late eighteenth century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in purchasing power parity (and Britain had a per capita income of nearly 2,000 dollars[15] whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars. Also, the average interest rate was about 5 percent in Britain and over 30 percent in China, which illustrates how capital was much more abundant in Britain; capital that was available for investment. Some historians such as David Landes[16] and Max Weber credit the different belief systems in China and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred. The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of Judaeo-Christianity, and Greek thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like Confucius, Mencius, Han Feizi (Legalism), Lao Tzu (Taoism), and Buddha (Buddhism). The key difference between these belief systems was that those from Europe focused on the individual, while Chinese beliefs centered around relationships between people. The family unit was more important than the individual for the large majority of Chinese history, and this may have played a role in why the Industrial Revolution took much longer to occur in China. There was the additional difference of outlook. In traditional societies, people tend to look backwards to tradition for answers to their questions. One of the inventions of the modern age was the invention of progress, where people look hopefully to the future. Furthermore, Western European peoples had experienced the Renaissance and Reformation; other parts of the world had not had a similar intellectual breakout, a condition that holds true even into the twenty-first century. Regarding India, the Marxist historian Rajani Palme Dutt has been quoted as saying, ""The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in England.""[17] In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms, with the three major ones being the Marathas, Sikhs and the Mughals. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors—agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and technical innovation was non-existent. The vast amounts of wealth were stored away in palace treasuries, and as such, were easily moved to Britain. The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slavery provided only 5 percent of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.[18] Alternatively, the greater liberalization of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and utilize emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and possessing the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets having been destroyed during the war by the Royal Navy[19]). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position—an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe. Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. Enclosure of common land and the related Agricultural Revolution made a supply of this labor readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the North of England, the English Midlands, South Wales and the Scottish Lowlands. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry. The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688, and British society's greater receptiveness to change (when compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favoring the Industrial Revolution. In large part due to the Enclosure movement, the peasantry was destroyed as significant source of resistance to industrialization, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.[20] Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.1 The existence of this class is often linked to the Protestant work ethic (see Max Weber) and the particular status of dissenting Protestant sects, such as the Quakers, Baptists and Presbyterians that had flourished with the English Civil War. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the Bank of England, contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures. Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's only two Universities at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's four universities). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official Anglican church became mandatory due to the Test Act, they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The Unitarians, in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences—areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies. Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the middle class, such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the Scientific revolution of the 17th century. In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labor dominated by a pace set by machines. However, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place as well. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel—child labor, dirty living conditions and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.[21] Industrialization led to the creation of the factory. Arguably the first was John Lombe's water-powered silk mill at Derby was operational by 1721. However, the rise of the factory came somewhat later when cotton- spinning was mechanized. The factory system was largely responsible for the rise of the modern city, as workers migrated into the cities in search of employment in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed Cottonopolis, and arguably the world's first industrial city. For much of the nineteenth century, production was done in small mills, which were typically powered by water and built to serve local needs. Later each mill would have its own steam engine and a tall chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler. The transition to industrialization was not wholly smooth. For example, a group of English workers known as Luddites formed to protest against industrialization and sometimes sabotaged factories, by throwing a wooden shoe (sabot) into the mechanical works. One of the earliest reformers of factory conditions was Robert Owen. In other industries the transition to factory production followed a slightly different course. In 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system. The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase. Industrial workers were better paid than those in agriculture. With more money, women ate better and had healthier babies, who were themselves better fed. Child mortality rates declined, and the distribution of age in the population became more youthful. There was limited opportunity for formal education, and children were expected to work in order to bring home wages. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new there were no experienced adult laborers. This made child labor the labor of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution. Child labor had existed before the Industrial Revolution, but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Before the passing of laws protecting children, many were forced to work in terrible conditions for much lower pay than their elders. Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines[22] and textile factories[23] and these helped to spread knowledge the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare. Politicians and the government tried to limit child labor by law, but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation, and others simply welcomed the cheap labor. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labor, the Factory Acts, were passed in England: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law. About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. These laws decreased the number of child laborers; however, child labor remained in Europe up to the twentieth century. Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the splendor of the homes of the owners to the squalor of the lives of the workers. Cliffe Castle, Keighley, is a good example of how the newly rich chose to live. This is a large home modeled loosely on a castle with towers and garden walls. The home is very large and was surrounded by a massive garden, the Cliffe Castle is now open to the public as a museum. Poor people lived in very small houses in cramped streets. These homes would share toilet facilities, have open sewers and would be at risk of damp. Disease was spread through a contaminated water supply. Conditions did improve during the nineteenth century as public health acts were introduced covering things such as sewage, hygiene and making some boundaries upon the construction of homes. Not everybody lived in homes like these. The Industrial Revolution created a larger middle class of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. The conditions for the poor improved over the course of the 19th century because of government and local plans which led to cities becoming cleaner places, but life had not been easy for the poor before industrialization. However, as a result of the Revolution, huge numbers of the working class died due to disease spreading through the cramped living conditions. Chest diseases from the mines, cholera from polluted water and typhoid were also extremely common, as was smallpox. Accidents in factories with child and female workers were regular. Dickens' novels perhaps best illustrate this; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw. Strikes and riots by workers were also relatively common. The rapid industrialization of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The textile industry in particular industrialized early, and many weavers found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labor to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of Ned Ludd, a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811.[24] The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government had to take drastic measures to protect industry. The Industrial Revolution concentrated labor into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organization of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labor and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffer the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining. The main method the unions used to effect change was strike action. Strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In England, the Combination Act forbade workers to form any kind of trade union from 1799 until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. In the 1830s and 1840s the Chartist movement was the first large scale organized working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration. Working people also formed friendly societies and co-operative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as Robert Owen also supported these organizations to improve the conditions of the working class. Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a General Strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organized through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.[25] Eventually effective political organization for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to became the British Labour Party. The application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5 percent in 1730 - 1749 to 31.8 percent in 1810 - 1829.[26] Besides, there was a significant increase in worker wages during the period 1813-1913.[27][28][29] The advent of The Enlightenment provided an intellectual framework which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of scientific knowledge—a factor evidenced in the systematic development of the steam engine, guided by scientific analysis, and the development of the political and sociological analyzes, culminating in Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. One of the main arguments for capitalism is that industrialization increases wealth for all, as evidenced by rising life expectancy, reduced working hours, and no work for children and the elderly. Marxism is essentially a reaction to the Industrial Revolution.[30] According to Karl Marx, industrialization polarized society into the bourgeoisie (those who own the means of production, the factories and the land) and the much larger proletariat (the working class who actually perform the labor necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production). He saw the industrialization process as the logical dialectical progression of feudal economic modes, necessary for the full development of capitalism, which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of socialism and eventually communism. During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards (or an emotional retreat from) the new industrialization developed. This was known as the Romantic movement. Its major exponents in English literature included the artist and poet William Blake and poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The movement stressed the importance of ""nature"" in art and language, in contrast to 'monstrous' machines and factories; the ""Dark satanic mills"" of Blake's poem And did those feet in ancient time.

The country has access to the ocean through a 40-kilometre (25 mi) stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9 km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa. When the Belgian Congo became independent, its leaders fought each other. The Soviet Union and later the United Nations helped destroy the groups who wanted independence from the new country. The Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated the country. It involved nine African nations and some twenty armed groups. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues in the east of the country. The war is the world's deadliest conflict since World War II, killing 5.4 million people since 1998. The vast majority died from conditions of malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition.

what is a central belief of the new age movement,"Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. Theologically, the New Age typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming Age of Aquarius, from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on a New Age ""science"" that seeks to unite science and spirituality.",,,,,,,,,,

Missouri’s Wildlife Code Protects Snakes Few Missourians realize that all snakes native to our state are protected. The Wildlife Code of Missouri treats snakes, lizards, and most turtles as nongame. This means that there is no open season on these animals, and it is technically unlawful to kill them. There is a realistic exception, however: when a venomous snake is in close association with people, which could result in someone being bitten. We hope that more people realize that snakes are interesting, valuable, and, for the most part, harmless. How to Tell Venomous from Nonvenomous Snakes Venomous snakes All venomous snakes native to Missouri are members of the pit viper family. Pit vipers have a characteristic pit located between the eye and nostril on each side of the head. They also have a pair of well-developed fangs. Note the shape of the pupil. The pupils of venomous snakes appear as vertical slits within the iris. Our venomous species all have a single row of scales along the underside of the tail. Missouri’s venomous snakes include the copperhead, cottonmouth, western pygmy rattlesnake, massasauga rattlesnake, and timber rattlesnake. The western diamond-backed rattlesnake and coral snake are not found in Missouri. The most common venomous snake in Missouri is the copperhead. To our knowledge, there have only been two human deaths attributed to venomous snakes in Missouri: a 1933 timber rattlesnake bite and a 1965 copperhead bite. Nonvenomous snakes Harmless snakes have round pupils and a double row of scales along the undersides of their tails. A triangle-shaped head doesn’t necessarily mean danger. Although the venomous snakes have a somewhat triangle-shaped head, several harmless species, such as water-snakes, gartersnakes, and hog-nosed snakes, can and do flatten their heads, which can cause them to appear triangular.

Some of the most venomous are the cottonmouth, the copperhead, the Western rattlesnake, the timber rattlesnake, the blacktail rattlesnake, the Western diamondback rattlesnake, the Massagauga pygmy rattlesnake, and the harlequin coral snake. However, in Texas you can also come across some non-venomous snakes that look similar to their venomous relatives; some of them even emit a rattling sound. For example, the venomous coral snake and the milk snake look remarkably alike. Snakes have a critical role to play in the ecosystem, and not all snakes are harmful to humans. However, pit vipers, who get their name because they have a pit close to each nostril that allows them to sense the body heat of warm-blooded victims, are venomous. There are actually over 150 pit viper species around the world, with even more subspecies and varieties. Texas coral snakes, on the other hand, are not pit vipers but Elapids, like the cobra. The Western or Texas diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) is the largest pit viper with the capacity to grow to over eight feet in the right conditions. You’ll find this snake all over Texas except for the east and the northern panhandle, and especially in areas of thick brush or vegetation, usually opting for dry areas rather than wetlands. It is a very heavy snake, and it is the second cause of deaths due to snakebite in the country after its Eastern cousin. Its brownish “base” with cream outlines around the classic diamond shape and a quick to respond rattle announce its presence. The Western diamondback has a massive range, extending well into Mexico and stretching from the Southeast to California and approximately halfway to Canada. Although the venom is somewhat less toxic than some other rattlesnakes, it makes up for it by producing immense quantities, as much as 800 mg can be delivered in a full envenomation. The venom causes severe muscle deterioration as well as massive internal bleeding. As with the Eastern diamondback, fatality rates are estimated at 20%. The Western diamondback only trails its Eastern cousin (slightly) in U.S. annual fatalities and would certainly be the leading killer if its habitat were less sparsely settled by humans. The Western diamondback is easily the snake most responsible for venomous snakebite deaths in Mexico. Copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix) are brown, tan or rust-colored with lighter gray, brown or copper bands and patches. They are easily camouflaged by the leaf covered forest ground, and as a result they are dangerous to accidentally come across.  The copperhead is a member of the pit viper family, like most of the venomous snakes in North America. Its primary range is along the Eastern Seaboard as far north as New York and inland as far west as Nebraska. Just like the coral snake, the copperhead has been copied by other non-dangerous species of snake such as the northern water snake. A moderately-sized snake, most copperheads are less than 36 inches with larger specimens reaching 48 inches. The snake is fairly stout with weights from 1/2 to 3/4 of a pound. The venom of copperheads is weaker than that of other pit adders. It is considered to be non-aggressive, and when excited/threatened, the copperhead will often assume a “freeze” strategy and rely on its excellent camouflage (ironically, making it easier for unwary humans to step on it, provoking a bite). All pit vipers are capable of delivering a bite with little or no venom delivered, but the copperhead is unique in that most defensive first strikes include no venom. If the snake is still being threatened, a second strike almost always does include venom. The Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) has brightly colored markings that can easily be confused to that of non-venomous species, who have developed them to look more threatening to potential predators and ward them off. If the yellow and red bands touch - not red and black - you are facing a venomous coral snake. This rhyme might help you to remember: “Red and yellow, can kill a fellow; Red and black, a friend of Jack” This essentially means when red and yellow are together in the pattern, the snake is venomous. If the red is next to a black stripe, the snake is not venomous. Coral snakes tend to live in soil or within rock burrows, particularly in scrub-covered sand hills. They are shy, but their nocturnal habits can create problems for humans. In case a bite does occur, symptoms can develop as paralysis sets in, with slurring of speech, vision issues, and respiratory failure. Fatality rates are estimated to be as high as 20%, but there is some ""good"" news: coral snakes are unable to release their venom fully in a single strike and full evenomation requires a chewing-like process and a relatively long bite. It is estimated that 40% of the bites (about 100 per year in North America) to humans contain no, or very little venom. The Western (Micruroides euryxanthus) and Eastern (Micrurus fulvius) coral snakes are pretty similar in many ways. Both have some of the most potent neurotoxic venom in North America, both are brightly colored with primary black and red stripes with smaller yellow encircling stripes, and both species prefer the southern part of North America. The Western coral snake is approximately 24 inches with larger examples exceeding 30 inches. Although rarely seen in daylight, the Western coral snake prefers dry, rocky areas and desert. The Eastern coral snake typically burrows underground during the day and prefers leafy forest areas. The cottonmouth bite is much more dangerous and harmful to humans than the bite of the closely related copperhead. The cottonmouth is more aggressive, but as with the copperhead, biting isn’t common unless the snake is actually touched. Conversely, the cottonmouth/water moccasin has a more aggressive reputation, but when threatened, will occasionally hiss and almost always assume a strike-ready pose. The biggest difference between the cottonmouth and the copperhead is that cottonmouth snakes are semi-aquatic and are most commonly found in marsh, swamp, and warmer streams and lakes. The cottonmouth is the only semi-aquatic viper in the world. They have been seen in saltwater and have colonized some near offshore islands on the east coast. Actually the third most dangerous rattlesnake in North America, the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) graces the famous Gadsden flag (don’t tread on me), and certainly has spawned more fear and respect from settlers than any other through the history of the United States! More of a medium-sized snake, the timber rattler is often found in rugged terrain and forests, although during the summer it is not unknown for pregnant females to head to warmer and more open spaces such as rocky ledges. Females tend to seek sunny open areas when preparing to give birth to 10-20 young. They are well known for their love of garter snakes, a common species of non-venomous snake found in Texas. The timber rattler can grow to more than five feet with the largest recorded at a few inches beyond 6 feet. Large specimens can weigh nearly 10 lbs. Typical adults will be near 40 inches. As with all rattlesnakes, the timber rattler can deliver considerable venom in a single, quick bite. Also typical of the entire genus, toxicity can vary among specimens, for the timber rattlesnake, this is especially pronounced and varies by region. With their large size, extremely long fangs, and the ability to deliver massive doses, a timber rattlesnake bite should be considered life-threatening. Fortunately, the timber rattlesnake is generally hesitant to strike defensively, displaying a long and vigorous posture with a loud rattle. It is mostly an ambush hunter that preys primarily on rabbit, birds, and small rodents, This mottled brown (often nearly black) can be extremely difficult to see.","The page you are looking for has left the site to go fly fishing on one of Missouri's many Ozark streams.

However, in Texas you can also come across some non-venomous snakes that look similar to their venomous relatives; some of them even emit a rattling sound. Consider the venomous coral snake and the milk snake, which look remarkably alike. There are at least 15 potentially dangerous snake species in Texas: however, estimates show that more deaths are attributed to lightning strikes than to snakebites. Outreach by snake experts has ensured that people are aware of how dangerous these snakes can be, and modern first aid and medical practices mean that people are usually treated properly and in time. Snakes have a critical role to play in the ecosystem, and not all snakes are harmful to humans. However, there are also dangerous types such as the pit vipers or adders, who get their name because they have a pit close to each nostril that allows them to sense the body heat of warm-blooded victims. There are over 150 pit viper species around the world, with even more subspecies and varieties. The most lethal venomous snakes in Texas are pit vipers, and they include rattlesnakes and moccasin snakes such as the cottonmouth and the copperhead. Coral snakes, on the other hand, are not pit vipers but Elapids, like the cobra. Let's get to know them. The Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) has brightly colored markings that can easily be confused to that of non-venomous species, who have developed them to look more threatening to potential predators and ward them off. If the yellow and red bands touch - not red and black - you are facing a venomous coral snake. Coral snakes live in soil or within rock burrows, in scrub covered sand hills.

In case a bite does occur, symptoms can develop as paralysis sets in, with slurring of speech, vision issues, and respiratory failure. Bites are rarely lethal, as there is an antivenin available. Here you can learn more about coral snakes as pets. Copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix) are brown, tan or rust-colored with lighter gray, brown or copper bands and patches. They are easily camouflaged by the leaf covered forest ground, and as a result they are dangerous to accidentally come across. The venom of copperheads is weaker than that of other pit adders, but it can cause secondary infections besides pain and nausea. Copperheads are one of the venomous snakes in Florida as well. Another of the venomous snakes in Texas is the Western cottonmouth or water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma), which can be found near water, in the ditches, canals, swamps, marshes, ponds and lakes of the eastern and central parts of Texas as well as the Gulf coast. The Western cottonmouth is a stubby, muscular snake which can grow up to 157 cm (62 in). The inside of its mouth has white shading, hence why it is called a cottonmouth. The older the snake becomes, the darker its coloration is from lighter browns to darker shades as time advances. When it is attacked, this snake can defend itself using venom. Although it only attacks when threatened, the toxic venom requires medical intervention. These snakes can even bite under water: from swimmers to travelers, everyone in Texas needs to keep an eye out for them. Rattlesnakes get their name from the rattle sound they make before striking. They hunt for small prey such as rabbits, rats, and mice.

That wide head, evident in the first picture, would have certainly given me pause, making me think it was venomous, until I saw the round pupils. Thanks David, I know I was super excited when I found out it was a species previously unknown to me. It is always exciting to see any snake, but doubly so when it is something new. I know what you mean George, at first glance and from a distance they somewhat resemble rattlesnakes. However many of our non-venomous snakes have that triangular shaped head, that is why I always tell people you can't go by that for identification. Jonathan, it sounds like you found a black rat snake at your grandfathers place. They can get quite large and startle a person for sure. I have a friend who lives in CA and she cusses those bullfrogs. They are native here where I live, so they pose little problem here where we have adequate predators to keep them under control. There are many types of water snakes found in the world and water snake one of them. A snake could strike you from a distance of half of their body length.Water snake water snake, thank you for sharing the link with me. Very useful information. I was looking at the chart of water snakes in the USA and noticed for Missouri you had ""plain bellied water snake"" is that what we refer to as the yellow-bellied water snake(Nerodia erythrogaster flavigaster)? I also didn't see the semi-aquatic Western Mud Snake on your list. I encountered one last week, but I didn't know that it was a water snake. Being naive of snakes, I thought it's a cottonmouth or something venomous. That made me become addicted reading and researching about these water snakes. This is the first site I came across: http://www.watersnake.net/Good thing they're not really that dangerous. Or else.. :( Saw one of these at Indian Camp Creek park in Wentzville/ Moscow Mills area today. Had i not had my 3 kids at a snake and lizard seminar at Busch Wildlife this morning i would have definitely thought this was a venomous snake. However what we learned today the easiest way to identify a venomous snake is not by its head but by diamond shaped eyes, single row of scales on the underside of their tail and if it has fangs or not. There are only 5 venomous snakes found in Missouri. Copperheads, Western Cottonmouth, Western Pygmy Rattlesnake, Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the Timber Rattlesnake. I encountered one of the creamy yellow diamondback water snakes while doing landscaping for an apartment complex in Columbia, MO on 8/7/2013. It was lying on tan mulch wrapped around a small bush near very large rocks overlooking a steep bank that drops down to an old creek bed.  The creek winds through town near walking/biking trails, businesses, homes and the MO University campus.  The snake was sunning at the southern-most bush on a 80 degree day (much cooler than our normal August temp) at 2pm.  I had grabbed the bush to remove weeds from the mulch and was surprised as I had not seen snakes on the upper grounds before.  I knew there were copperheads in the creek bed below.  Had I not seen the diamonds I would have kept working as the snake's color was the same as the mulch.  I backed away and the snake eventually disappeared down into the mulch, was seen going down through the rocks toward the creek bed.  I am a 60 year old retired RN who likes working outdoors, have lived in the country most of my life, have seen many snakes but the first diamondback water snake!  I am amazed and thankful it did not strike at my hands or legs/feet.  I will be more cautious and get snake boots. These are beautiful snakes, sadly many are killed out of fear and ignorance due to their resemblance to other venomous snakes like the cottonmouth.","Indiana's vast variety of habitats lends itself to a wide collection of snakes. Some prefer wooded habitats while others prefer open meadows. Water snakes and those that prefer marshes or other wetlands are also present. Encountering a venomous snake is rare in Indiana, but all four venomous species are pit vipers that can be identified by their elliptical pupils, their triangular heads and the heat-sensing pits behind their nostrils. Indiana's vast variety of habitats lends itself to a wide collection of snakes. Some prefer wooded habitats while others prefer open meadows. Water snakes and those that prefer marshes or other wetlands are also present. Encountering a venomous snake is rare in Indiana, but all four venomous species are pit vipers that can be identified by their elliptical pupils, their triangular heads and the heat-sensing pits behind their nostrils. Of the over 30 species of snake found in Indiana, only four are venomous, and all four are pit vipers. The four species of venomous snake found in Indiana are the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus), northern copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen) and western cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus). Timber rattlesnakes inhabit a small area in south-central Indiana; the eastern massasauga is an endangered species that inhabits northern Indiana. Only a small, isolated population of cottonmouths exists in south-central Indiana. Copperheads have the largest range of any venomous snake in the state: it spreads across southern Indiana into areas of central Indiana. The black racer (Coluber constrictor) varies in color from black in the southern part of the state to blue in its northern range. Both color varieties exist in Indiana. These snakes are quite large, reaching lengths of 5 feet. The black rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta) is particularly large, growing up to 8 feet long. These snakes are particularly good climbers and are often encountered in the rafters of barns and other structures. Both racers and rat snakes are constrictors. Many of Indiana's snakes are patterned with colorful stripes, bands or blotches. Milk snakes (Lampropeltis triangulatum) have rust-colored blotches with thick, black outlines on a whitish-gray background. Brown snakes (Storeria dekayi) are light brown with a row of diamond-shaped spots along each side of their backs. The garter snakes (Thamnoophis spp.) of Indiana typically have conspicuous stripes along their green to black bodies. Some species also have spots or a checkerboard pattern. Indiana is home to a few species of water snake. The northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon sipedon) and midland water snake (Nerodia sipedon pleuralis) inhabit the north half and south half of the state, respectively. Sometimes mistaken for copperheads or cottonmouths due to their dark-brown-and-tan pattern, these snakes are completely harmless. The queen snake (Regina septemvittata) is an olive-green to olive-brown color with a distinctly yellow belly. Kirtland's water snake (Clonophis kirtlandi) is an endangered species found in the northern two-thirds of the state.

(AP) — Authorities seized nearly two dozen weapons, silencers and some 35,000 rounds of ammunition at the Southern California home of a person who turned into forbidden to personal guns due to.","The 9mm or 9×19mm Parabellum is a firearms cartridge that was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) (German Weapons and Munitions Factory) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol. For this reason, it is designated as the 9mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute (SAAMI), and the 9mm Luger by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l’Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP). The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin: Si vis pacem, para bellum (“If you seek peace, prepare for war”), which was the motto of DWM. Under STANAG 4090, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. According to the 2014 edition of Cartridges of the World, the 9×19mm Parabellum is “the world’s most popular and widely used military handgun and submachinegun cartridge.” In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S., Newsweek credits 9×19mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers. The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use. Its low cost and wide availability contribute to the caliber’s continuing popularity. The round was originally designed to be lethal to 50 meters, but is still lethal at longer ranges. The 9mm cartridge combines a flat trajectory with moderate recoil. According to the 1986 book Handloading: “the modern science of wound ballistics has established beyond reasonable doubt that the 9mm cartridge is highly effective.” In 2014, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a report detailing the potential combat effectiveness of the 9mm cartridge when compared to other calibers such as the .45 ACP and the .40 S&W cartridge that was specifically developed for use by the FBI. The report indicated that the new powders and more advanced bullet designs used in current 9mm defensive loads allowed for the caliber to deliver almost similar performance to other calibers, like the .45 ACP, and .40 S&W. In addition to this, the lower recoil, less wear, cheaper ammunition and higher capacity were all reasons that the report cited for the recent surge in orders of the ammunition from various police agencies. With a wider selection of officers being able to shoot handguns chambered in 9×19mm, many departments choose this caliber so they can standardize around a single firearm and loading, making logistics and supply easier. Due to all of these factors, law enforcement orders of 9mm ammo from all major ammunition manufacturers have spiked significantly. The FBI report made it clear that the more consistent accuracy of 9mm in the hands of their less experienced shooters was a factor in their returning to 9mm as their standard handgun caliber. It was also made clear that the almost same effectiveness of 9mm compared to .40 S&W and .45 ACP was due to the high quality of 9mm ammunition available.

when did the virginia colony become a state,"After declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1775, before the Declaration of Independence was officially adopted, the Virginia colony became the Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the original thirteen states of the United States, adopting as its official slogan ""The Old Dominion"". The entire modern states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, and portions of Ohio and Western Pennsylvania were later created from the territory encompassed, or claimed by, the colony of Virginia at the time of further American independence in July 1776.",,,,,,,,,,
meaning of the song this woman's work,"The lyric of ""This Woman's Work"" is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth. Written for the movie She's Having a Baby, director John Hughes used the song during the film's dramatic climax, when Jake (Kevin Bacon) learns that the lives of his wife, Kristy (Elizabeth McGovern), and their unborn child are in danger. As the song plays, we see a montage sequence of flashbacks showing the couple in happier times, intercut with shots of him waiting for news of Kristy and their baby's condition. Bush wrote the song specifically for the sequence, writing from a man's (Jake's) viewpoint and matching the words to the visuals which had already been filmed.","Lyrics mean so much to my personal life. This blog is about music that relates to my opinions, love & life. Here’s a cute song about.. well, Love. =P This track simplifies how I feel sometimes. I’m quite a pessimistic person, I have a feeling like there’s always better person, better situation, better life, better experience, better anything. It’s like you try and try, and you give and give and you’ve given up. Yet, sometimes all we need is to be in the comfort of someone who can lift your spirits up. Make you feel worth living, makes you want to live in the now and look forward to the future – and forget the past (the negative ones). We won’t need a time machine if we are content, happy with our present and know that there’s always a better future awaiting in front of us all. I’ve just stumbled into this track while listening to some XFactor Contestants. What a great song. I love the tenderness and the lyrics. Totally reminded me of Kevin Michael. The high pitch tender voice and the big afro. Oh what memories. So this track is supposedly about being a mother to an unborn child and from a guy’s point of view. I got this track literally from Twitter. ViLLE BABY actually dropped me a message (and I’m sure others too) with a link to this and I’ve gotta say, I’m resonating with this track. It’s smooth, great lyrics and clear message delivered. I remember back when I listened to these tracks a lot. It’s been hard to write up these messages because we’re too busy living our lives. We’re better than that, and the problem is – others ain’t the same. How about we do our part to have some changes? Posted in Lyrics, Music Video, Personal Post, Song Comment tagged Mr. Probz, Sapphire, waves at 11:57 am by LynxLee I heard Waves on an Internet radio just a while ago and I can’t stop listening to it. Then I checked out YouTube and Mr. Probz got this video as well. I have to say, this guy has got amazing talent in music. I love it. Can you feel it? Gotta love the care in this track. We sometimes get into that state of mind when we get in love, and everything is beautiful. Then it started to get really.. addictive, really crazy in some way. Jealousy plagues in your mind, Missing that person to the state of dilemma and Unable to think straight. Who says falling in love is easy? It hurts, but probably the easiest way to feel better is to never fall in love again. I believe this is what some of my friends had decided. The excuse was, no one is perfect enough for me. Personally, if you are lovesick – move on. You’ll go through it again eventually. I heard this on the radio and thought I’d share it.","Kate Bush Encyclopedia is free to use, but not to operate.

A year later, the song was included in Kate's sixth studio album The Sensual World. The lyric is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth. Written for the movie She's Having a Baby, director John Hughes used the song during the film's dramatic climax, when Jake (Kevin Bacon) learns that the lives of his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and their unborn child are in danger. As the song plays, we see a montage sequence of flashbacks showing the couple in happier times, intercut with shots of him waiting for news of Elizabeth and their baby's condition. Bush wrote the song specifically for the sequence, writing from a man's (Jake's) viewpoint and matching the words to the visuals which had already been filmed. The song was used in the 21st episode of the third season of Party Of Five, the second episode of the series Alias and in the first episode of the second season of The Handmaid's Tale. The song was also used in the film A Man Called Otto. 'This Woman's Work' was released as a 7"" single, a 7"" picture disc single, a 12"" single (with poster sleeve), a cassette single and a CD-single. In Germany, a 3"" CD-single was also released. On all formats, the bonus track Be Kind To My Mistakes was included, plus - on all formats except the 7"" singles and the cassette single - I'm Still Waiting. There are four different versions of 'This Woman's Work'. The original version was released on the soundtrack album of the movie 'She's Having A Baby'. The version of the song that was featured on 'The Sensual World' was re-edited from the original version. The version released as a single was a third, slightly different mix.Finally, 'This Woman's Work' was completely re-recorded on Kate's 2011 album Director's Cut. The new version features a sparse performance of Bush playing the piano and singing. The music video was directed by Bush herself. It starts with Bush, spotlighted in an otherwise black room, playing the introductory notes on a piano. In the next scene, a distraught man (played by Tim McInnerny) is pacing in the waiting room of a hospital. It is then revealed through flashbacks that his wife (played by Bush) has collapsed while they were having dinner. The story blurs into a continuous scene where he carries her to the car, a desperate race to the hospital, and his wife being wheeled away on a stretcher as he races in behind her. While waiting, the husband is wracked with fear and imagines his wife in happier times, kissing him in the rain, and even imagines the nurse coming to tell him she has died. The nurse then pulls him out of his reverie, as she reassuringly puts her hand on his shoulder and tells him about his wife's situation, the outcome of this is left ambiguous; yet the nurse is seen smiling as she speaks, implying a happy outcome. The final scene of the video returns to Bush as silently closes the piano keyboard. 'This Woman's Work' was covered by Aco, Baby Bushka, Beloved, Bonnie Bailey, Dark Dark Dark, Kat Devlin, E-Clypse featuring Emma Price, Jess Gillam, Goodknight Productions, Göteborgs Symfoniker, Glennis Grace, Hope for Isla & Jude,  The Kate Bush Experience, Lady Maisery, Greg Laswell, Maxwell, Hope Murphy, Octover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Quaker Notes, Lindsay Schief, Titlucio, Tk The Prophet,  TM Collective, Reginald Van Carreker and Rachel Z. John Hughes, the American film director, had just made this film called 'She's Having A Baby', and he had a scene in the film that he wanted a song to go with. And the film's very light: it's a lovely comedy. His films are very human, and it's just about this young guy - falls in love with a girl, marries her. He's still very much a kid. She gets pregnant, and it's all still very light and child-like until she's just about to have the baby and the nurse comes up to him and says it's a in a breech position and they don't know what the situation will be. So, while she's in the operating room, he has so sit and wait in the waiting room and it's a very powerful piece of film where he's just sitting, thinking; and this is actually the moment in the film where he has to grow up. He has no choice. There he is, he's not a kid any more; you can see he's in a very grown-up situation. And he starts, in his head, going back to the times they were together. There are clips of film of them laughing together and doing up their flat and all this kind of thing. And it was such a powerful visual: it's one of the quickest songs I've ever written. It was so easy to write. We had the piece of footage on video, so we plugged it up so that I could actually watch the monitor while I was sitting at the piano and I just wrote the song to these visuals. It was almost a matter of telling the story, and it was a lovely thing to do: I really enjoyed doing it. (Roger Scott Interview, BBC Radio 1 (UK), 14 October 1989) That's the sequence I had to write the song about, and it's really very moving, him in the waiting room, having flashbacks of his wife and him going for walks, decorating... It's exploring his sadness and guilt: suddenly it's the point where he has to grow up. He'd been such a wally up to this point. (Len Brown, 'In The Realm Of The Senses'. NME (UK), 7 October 1989) There's a film called 'She's Having A Baby'. And John Hughes, the director, rung up and said that he had a sequence in the film that he really wanted a song written to be with. And I'd only worked the once before on the 'Castaway' film - where I'd really enjoyed that - so I was extremely tempted by the offer. And when he sent the piece of film that the song was going to be part of, I just thought it was wonderful, it was so moving, a very moving piece of film. And in a way, there was a sense that the whole film built up to this moment. And it was a very easy song to write. It was very quick. And just kind of came, like a lot of songs do. Even if you struggle for months, in the end, they just kind of go - BLAH! - You know. [Laughs]. So that was the first song that I wrote for 'The Sensual World' album. In fact at the time we weren't even sure whether to put it on the album or not. And I must say that Del was very instrumental in saying that I should put it on the album, and I'm very glad I did. Because I had the most fantastic response - in some ways, maybe the greatest response - to this song. And I was really - I was absolutely thrilled, that you felt that way about it.

where did the ring around the rosie song come from,"""Ring a Ring o' Roses"" or ""Ring a Ring o' Rosie"" is a nursery rhyme or folksong and playground singing game. It first appeared in print in 1881, but it is reported that a version was already being sung to the current tune in the 1790s and similar rhymes are known from across Europe. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7925. Urban legend says the song originally described the plague, specifically the Great Plague of London, or the Black Death, but folklorists reject this idea.","The origins of this rhyme are unknown. The name refers to a type of porridge made from peas, pease pudding, also known in Middle English as pease pottage (“Pease” was treated as a mass noun, similar to “oatmeal”).

Ok, so I'm writing this article in the dead of winter.  It's like 10 degrees right now so what did you do for fun retro style when it was cold or raining outside?  Well, before the era of video games we had the analog version - board games!  They ranged from the simple to the complex and from the fun to the serious.  Let's take a look at a few. Chinese Checkers... It's like checkers except it isn't.  In fact, it isn't even chinese at all.  Chinese Checkers is of German origin called Sternhalma which can be played by two, three, four, or six people, played individually or with partners. MONOPOLY IS A GAME BEST PLAYED WHEN YOU MAKE UP YOUR OWN RULES.  COME ON, YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN SET OF MONOPOLY RULES.  I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW THIS PARKER BROTHERS GAME CAUGHT ON GIVEN THE ORIGINS WHICH SOUND LIKE... WELL... NOT MUCH FUN - MONOPOLY ORIGINATED IN 1903 AS A WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AN ECONOMY WHICH REWARDS WEALTH CREATION IS BETTER THAN ONE IN WHICH MONOPOLISTS WORK UNDER FEW CONSTRAINTS AND TO PROMOTE THE ECONOMIC THEORIES OF HENRY GEORGE AND IN PARTICULAR HIS IDEAS ABOUT TAXATION.  THANKS FOR THAT BUMMER WIKIPEDIA. One of my favorites - trivial pursuit, or  as i like to call it, ""The game where I prove I'm the smartest person in the room"".  Plus you get to make a pie. Who doesn't like pie? then there was the pre-video game era equivelant of a button smasher game- hungry hungry hippos.  requires zero skill but you get to grab marbles with a hippopotamus... what's not to love? There are about one million variations of the classic kids game ""TAG!""  I had no idea.  From wearing blindfolds to cops and robbers, tag has been a favorite kid's game for generations.  if you want to go down this rabbit hole, here's the wikipedia article on tag and it's variations. Red Rover red rover please let that kid I despise run over so I can give him a stan hansen lariet to the face... maybe that was just me. Me playing red rover. Ring around the rosie.  Here's an old game... but did you know that this game is actually mega creepy? So, let's talk about Ring Around the Rosie.  Ok, this game is very old and also might be very creepy.  Again, I defer to Wikipedia- """"Ring a Ring o' Roses"" or ""Ring Around the Rosie"" or ""Ring a Ring o' Rosie"" is a nursery rhyme or folk-song and playground singing game. It first appeared in print in 1881, but it is reported that a version was already being sung to the current tune in the 1790s and similar rhymes are known from across Europe.  Urban legend says the song originally described the plague, specifically the Great Plague of London, or the Black Death, but folklorists reject this idea.""  Yes, the black death. The rhyme has been associated with the Great Plague which happened in England in 1665.  A rosy rash was a symptom of the plague, and posies of herbs were carried as protection and to ward off the smell of the disease. Sneezing or coughing was a final fatal symptom, and ""all fall down"" was exactly what happened.  The line Ashes, Ashes in colonial versions of the rhyme is claimed to refer to cremation of the bodies.  Yeah! Fun. Every kid needs a swing set.  It's like a roller coaster on a budget.  Even old people end up with a porch swing or a rocking chair.  there's just something fun about swinging. Slide! There's something fun about letting go and sliding down a slide.  However, back when it was cool we didn't have the nice safe plastic slides... no.  we had these metal, jagged, 150 degree bright metal death slides.  you not only had the thrill of sliding but also the challenge of surviving with all your fingers and toes and without 3rd degree burns. that's more like it... hope you've got your aleo vera ready. Yes, back #WhenItWasCool survival was a part of play time.  Don't even get me started about ""Hey, let's play war.  I got some firecrackers."" because there's a reason why you're told ""Don't try this at home.""  Somehow I managed to make it to adulthood with both eyes intact. But hey, have some adventure!  Have some imagination.  Put down the PlayStation controller for a bit and you and a friend grab a stick and go explore something.  It's Sunday- Funday!

His extended family decided to take a trip to Whidbey Island to see the Christmas decorations and do their Christmas shopping.  Having arrived on a tour boat from Seattle, the time ashore is not long, five and a half hours, but is still tiring for him. Not being fleet of foot, he has chosen this resting place where he is comfortable sitting on the bench with the boy and his dog in bronze for company.  He can look over Saratoga Passage to view Mount Baker and Camano Island.  If it were the springtime of the year, he might also add a grey whale and her young calf to this vista but, alas it is winter.  Because of the boat ride here, he bundled up when he dressed for this foray, his wife having insisted that he wear that heavy red sweater with the snowflakes all over it.  “It is Christmassy,” she had reminded him. He is toasty warm and happy to doze on this bench until his family returns. His wife, daughter and three granddaughters have agreed to meet him here before having lunch. Their chatter, running, jumping and hanging on grandpa has worn him down and he will have just a little rest here on the bench.  There are many folks milling about both from the tour boat and those who have traveled here by car, taking the ferry from the mainland.  Every year in Langley, the merchants dress the town for Christmas and this is the reason that his family has planned today’s event.  Lots of shops to see, great places to eat and….a place for grandpa to sit and enjoy the winter sun. Many fine artists live here on the island and every year there is a competition to see who can do the grandest display decorating the merchants’ doorways.  It is a stiff competition and the displays range from wacky and outrageous to absolutely gorgeous. Prizes are given to the winners.  This is part of the draw to come to Langley for Christmas shopping. While grandpa is dozing in the sun, a flock of little girls race into the Boy and the Dog Park where he is sitting.  They chatter like birds and awaken the old man.  He smiles at them, giving them reassurances that he is benign.  Suddenly one little girl jumps up on the bench and stands next to him. She chatters away at him in her high little girl voice.  He continues to smile and then nods his head.  She races off and talks with her companions.  “He nodded Yes!” she said excitedly.  Soon there is a line of little girls, all dressed in their Christmas sweaters, red coats, red hats, fleece boots and smiles.  They are lined up by the bench where the old man sits.  One by one they get up on the bench and whisper in his ear.  Mostly he cannot tell what they are saying because he has taken his hearing aids out and stuffed them in his jacket pocket.  And besides, little girl whispers are really hard to understand, but he smiles and nods his head. Soon they have all talked into his ear and they are all smiles and twirling pigtails and happiness.  He is happy too.  Their mothers are approaching from a nearby shop where one mother has stood vigilant outside the door to be sure the girls were safe.  The girls gather around their mothers and are all trying to relate their experiences all at once with lots of shrieks and squeals about talking with the old man. He sits contentedly on his bench enjoying their laughter and joy.  Soon his own granddaughters will be there to take him to lunch.  Hummmm….he IS getting hungry. The little flock of girls flies off up the street while calling to the old man. . .”GOOD BYE SANTA!” Once a year I hang my show at the Braeburn Restaurant in Langley, Washington.  Today is the day.  I will be hanging it after hours, so tomorrow will be the first day that you will have the opportunity to see it. In the past I have featured, trucks, barns, old gas stations, larger-than-life food items (peanut butter sandwiches 18 tall), crows and this year the feature is birds. When my show was taken down last year, I started thinking about what I would show for 2018.  I decided to do local birds.  These paintings are in watercolor, not my usual medium, which is oil.  The really unusual thing about the paintings is they are not painted on paper, but on treated panels of medium density fibreboard (MDF). Another unusual thing about them is that they are loosely painted, not the usual photorealism of my oil paintings. This makes them more spontaneous and whimsical than my usual works. There are twenty-five birds, a few dogs, and, yes, some trucks!  I would hope that you could visit the show sometime between July 14 and August 31. You may purchase any of the paintings and take them with you, which is nice if you are from out of town. The Braeburn Restaurant is located at 197 D. 2nd St. Langley, WA 98260. They serve breakfast and lunch. Their phone number is 360-321-3211. https://braeburnlangley.com/ Just came in from feeding the animals.  It is cold again this morning.  It was colder yesterday morning at 22 degrees, which for Western Washington, is cold.  Since we have rather high humidity, the cold is more penetrating.  For those who live in the mid-west, they probably would consider these temps a heat wave. Ha! Everything is frozen outside, so the first thing I had to do when getting suited up to meet the weather challenges was to fill a large bucket with very hot water.  The doves, the baby chicks and the molting old hens all need to have their waterers unfrozen.  I also filled the birdbaths with warm water as the poor wild birds have no place to drink. We have one baby dove who is just now fending for himself and I was worried that he might not make it through this cold.  This morning he is huddled in a corner trying to keep warm as his mother has now abandoned him since he can feed himself.  He was fine and jumped right in when the feed was provided. The ten chicks, which are now two months old, are very hardy, but today I gave them their first cracked corn, which helps warm the chickens from the inside out.  The also got fresh bread, which they chased all over their pen.  The cold doesn’t seem to faze them. The old hens, however, felt the cold.  Why do they choose to molt just when the weather turns cold.  Molting, as I have mentioned in earlier pieces, is the process of losing all their feathers and growing a new set, which means they are not laying any eggs.  So we are between eggs with old ones molting and new ones too young yet.  I hate buying store eggs. The plantings in the yard look sad, especially the rhododendrons that lower their leaves as though dead or dying.  This is the way they look in the heat of summer when they are in dire need of water.  I always hate the look of them in this cold. I know when things thaw that there will be lots of mud because the frost has pushed up around the stones in all the pathways making crunching noises as I walk out to do the chores. The advantage to all the trouble above is THE SUN IS SHINING. It is a trade off.  If we have sunshine, we have cold weather.  If it is in the 40s then it will rain and be grey.  Yesterday and this morning, we can bask in its warmth and enjoy the vitamins it gives to us, though begrudgingly in winter.  Makes me feel perkier already.  Amazing what a little sunshine can do for your mental health. Guess I will go for a walk and enjoy it.  Never know how long it will last. A couple of nights ago, I got up during the night (1 a.m.) to address the call of nature (an old lady thing) and thought that we had left a light on outside. Or maybe my husband’s truck had the interior light on inside the cab. I peeked out the window and the moon was shining as bright as day. I remember when I was small we had a clear, bright red phonograph record of children’s songs and this one was on it. Whenever I see the moon so bright, I sing this in my head. Does anyone else remember this song? The following is from Wikipedia. Girls and Boys Come Out to Play’ or ‘Boys and Girls Come Out to Play’ is a nursery rhyme that has existed since at least 1708. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 5452. And come with your playfellows into the street. Come with a good will or not at all. A halfpenny roll will serve us all. And we’ll have a pudding in half an hour.[1] Other versions often put boys before girls in the opening line.[2] The verse may date back to the time when children were expected to work during the daylight hours, and play was reserved for late in the evening. The first two lines at least appeared in dance books (1708, 1719, 1728), satires (1709, 1725), and a political broadside (1711). It appeared in the earliest extant collection of nursery rhymes, Tommy Thumb’s Pretty Song Book published in London around 1744. The 1744 version included the first six lines. Well, I guess the moonlight always makes me want to go out and dance in it. However, it was the middle of the night and the temperature was about 35F. I declined and tottered off to the WC. We have had several consecutive nights of bright moonlight. I usually use the lightness of the bedroom windows to tell me if it is about time to get up. The moonlight confuses that. Midnight moonlight and the gloaming of 6:30 a.m. look about the same these days. I went back to bed and went to sleep. Occasionally when I am driving home at night through the area where I live, which has very straight roads, if the moon is shining bright as day, I turn off my headlights and go home by moonlight. So far I haven’t alarmed anyone coming from the opposite direction. Can you imagine me turning on my headlights when they didn’t know anyone was there? This full moon is particularly interesting as it is the Lantern of the Lunar New Year. The fifteenth day of the New Year. New Year ’s Day is always the dark of the moon. Then as the moon grows in size various celebrations happen over a two week period. Example: New Year’s Eve, eat jiaozi (dumpling with pork and green onion) and visit with family. Days one through five you should not take anything from your house, even corpses. It is bad luck and you will lose your wealth. We went traveling in Hunan Provence on the fifth day and I commented to my Chinese student “Look at all the funeral processions. Was there a major disaster or accident?” He replied that it was the fifth day. The people who had died after the New Year could now be buried. There was also a slightly larger number of deaths after the new year as people try to stay alive just one more year and succumb shortly after. Second day, married women visit their parents. This is something that doesn’t always happen as the husband’s parents take precedence once you are married. The seventh day is considered the birthday of all the common class people. They will all celebrate this day. Important figures have birthdays on their day of birth. On the thirteenth day some families fast or eat reduced amounts of vegetarian foods because they have been feasting for twelve days. Day fourteen is a preparation day for the Lantern Festival when new lanterns will appear fresh, and red in front of shops and houses. Lantern day is celebrated by gifts of oranges. When we lived there, small mandarin orange trees covered with oranges on their branches and about three to four feet tall were given as gifts to family. Sweet rice balls are eaten to commemorate the full moon. Tāngyuán, a soup of round balls is also served. The “ruler of heaven’s” birthday is supposed to be on the fifteenth day. He is responsible for good luck, good fortune and wealth. So dancing in the moonlight is probably a good thing. Even though I want to do it now, I will probably wait until we are sleeping outside this summer when dancing in my nightgown won’t pose issues of hypothermia. Happy New Year.","Singing games began to be recorded and studied seriously in the nineteenth century as part of the wider folklore movement. Joseph Strutt’s Sports and Pastimes of the People of England (1801), Robert Chambers Popular Rhymes of Scotland (1826), James Orchard Halliwell’s The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and his Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales (1849), G. F. Northal’s English Folk Rhymes (1892), all included collected singing games. However, the first studies to focus solely on this area were William Wells Newell’s Games and Songs of American Children (1883) and Alice Gomme’s The Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1894-8), both considered landmark works in the serious study of the subject on respective sides of the Atlantic. Naturally, these works tended to have many of the faults associated with the folklore and folk song collecting of their eras, and have been criticised for a focus on rural society at the expense of the urban, and an obsession with recovering what were seen as disappearing ‘authentic’ and original verse, from adults, while disregarding contemporary practice by children. Some of these problems were rectified by a work like that of Norman Douglas, who produced London Street Games in 1916, focusing on the urban working classes. Perhaps still the most significant work in the field was that of Iona and Peter Opie, which departed from previous practice in Britain; following work by Dorothy Howard in America and Brian Sutton-Smith in New Zealand, they relied on detailed observation of children for their evidence resulting in their work on The Language and Lore of Schoolchildren (1959), Children’s Games in Street and Playground (1969) and The Singing Game (1985). Their extensive studies refuted the idea that the traditions of singing games were disappearing in the face of social and media change. Herbert and Mary Knapp, produced One Potato, Two Potato: the Secret Education of American Children (1976). Wider based studies include Helen Schwartzman’s Transformations: The Anthropology of Children’s Play (1978). As the emphasis of investigations changed so did the methods of recording. Early folklorists like Lady Gomme, tended to provide written descriptions of games, lyrics and occasionally musical notation of tunes. By the late 1970s there was increasing use of film to record the actual practice of games, providing a record of the relationship between movement and music. “Girls and Boys Come Out to Play” or “Boys and Girls Come Out to Play” is a nursery rhyme that has existed since at least 1708. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 5452. (The Roud Folk Song Index is a database of nearly 200,000 references to nearly 25,000 songs that have been collected from oral tradition in the English language from all over the world. It is compiled by Steve Roud, a former librarian in the London Borough of Croydon). Other versions often put boys before girls in the opening line. “Skip to My Lou” is a popular children’s song. Skip to My (The) Lou was a popular partner-stealing dance from America’s frontier period. In early America, ‘respectable folks’ in strict Protestant communities regarded the fiddle as one of the devil’s tools (if it led to dancing, which was regarded as sinful). Faced with such a religious obstacle to socializing, young people developed the “play-party,” in which all the objectionable features of dancing were removed or masked so that grave elders would overlook their activity. The dancers sang and the audience clapped to create rhythm for their own music. In time, the play-party acquired a life of its own. It became an ideal amusement for teenagers and young married couples. In many a frontier community, the bear hunters, Indian fighters, the rough keelboat men and the wild cowboys could be seen dancing innocently with their gals, like so many children at a Sunday school picnic. As people moved westward and communities shrugged off the ‘witch-hunt’ mentality which plagued early Protestant New England, square dancing and barn dancing became acceptable, at least to some. “Skip to My Lou” is a simple game of stealing partners (or swapping partners as in square dancing). It begins with any number of couples hand in hand, skipping around in a ring. A lone boy in the center of the moving circle of couples sings, “Lost my partner what’ll I do?” as the girls whirl past him. The young man in the center hesitates while he decides which girl to choose, singing, “I’ll get another one prettier than you.” When he grasps the hand of his chosen one, her partner then takes his place in the center of the ring and the game continues. It’s an ice-breaker, a good dance to get a group acquainted with one another and to get everyone in the mood for swinging around. The “loo” in the title is the Scottish word for “love.” The spelling change from “loo” to “lou” probably happened as Anglo-Americans, and the song, became Americanized.

where does us highway 27 start and end,"U.S. Route 27 (US 27) is a north -- south United States highway in the southern and midwestern United States. The southern terminus is at US 1 in Miami, Florida. The northern terminus is at Interstate 69 (I-69) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. From Miami it goes up the center of Florida, then west to Tallahassee, Florida, and north through such cities and towns as Columbus, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio; Oxford, Ohio; Richmond, Indiana; and Fort Wayne, Indiana. It once extended north through Lansing, Michigan, to Cheboygan, Mackinaw City, and for about 3 years as far as St. Ignace.","There is an average of one death every daylight hour as a result of large truck crashes. Did you know that every 16 minutes a person is killed or injured in a truck accident? Did you know that big rig truck accidents continue to increase? Even with these frightening scenarios and statistics, powerful trucking industry lobbyists continue to call for the weakening of truck safety rules and regulations to reap a higher profit. Trucking revenues totaled $615 billion last year and revenues are forecasted to nearly double by 2015. While commercial trucking growth is good news for the trucking companies and the nation’s economy, it is bad news for the cars, vans and SUVs that share the road with these potentially lethal giants. In tractor trailer accidents, 98% of fatalities occur to the individuals in the passenger vehicles. Tractor accidents are so common as tractors carrying heavy machinery such as Power Harrows are very slow on the road, and many people are not cautious when attempting to overtake them. Due to the power and size of the tractors, the smaller vehicle usually comes off worse for wear. From 1992 to 2002, the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes has increased by up to 10% due to driver fatigue, unsafe vehicle operation, large, unstable loads or defective equipment. Accidents involving semi-truck, 18-wheeler, and large trucks present many unique issues including driver fatigue, intoxication, driver error, equipment failure, and failure to maintain current inspection standards. According to this Texas truck accident lawyer 1 out of every 8 people killed in a traffic accident in the United States is killed in an accident involving a tractor trailer / semi truck. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) releases data about truck accidents, which is then published by many organizations as truck accident statistics. Every year, 500,000 large trucks, or “semis,” are involved in accidents on our roads. Of these, 5,000 involve fatalities and over 94,000 crashes resulting in injury. In crashes between passenger vehicles and large semi truck, the ration of occupant fatalities is about 21 to 1. A truck accident involving a big truck and a smaller vehicle or pedestrians, often has very tragic consequences. A big truck can weigh more than 80,000 pounds and can go up to 75 feet in length. Considering these numbers, it is not shocking that truck accidents result in more grievous injuries and larger number of deaths than other traffic accidents. What is shocking though are the alarming truck accident statistics. Truck accidents are a very real fact all around the world, with more and more people getting injured or dying in truck accidents everyday. In the United States itself, commercial truck accidents account for quite a significant percentage of all traffic accidents. This is why, following an accident, you should consider seeking out legal assistance; those looking for good Truck Accident Lawyers in Winchester may want to reach out to the Kendall Law Firm. Besides, getting legal aid, you can also take help of technology to tackle a mishap. In critical situations, like an accident, event driven architecture comes handy. How? Take for example, you are driving on a highway. Suddenly, your GPS system alerts that it is re-routing. It does so because something happened, an event occurred. In this case, the event was a traffic accident ahead of you on the road you are driving on. The result of that event has already started becoming backed-up heavy traffic that will delay you if you remain on this road. Instead, your GPS recommends that you switch to a parallel route. It even chooses that route for you and directs you as to how to get there. You made no request to be shown traffic patterns on the various area highways. In fact, you made no requests at all! All the systems involved, including you, your GPS, the guidance system, and the traffic monitoring system are very loosely connected to each other. However, they all quickly got together when the event was detected, and in so doing could reroute the vehicle through notifications sent to you. This, in essence, is Event Driven Architecture (EDA) in action, and also one of its greatest benefits! To better understand the concept and therefore the companies (Vantiq being one of them) that offer the gamut of technologies under EDA, it is always a good idea to visit their website(s). In 2001, there were 6,536 total crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks in Pennsylvania ;154 were fatal. In 2003, there were 58,512 total vehicle accidents involved in fatal crashes in the U.S. Large trucks are more likely to be involved in a fatal multi-vehicle crash than are passenger vehicles. In 2003, Texas witnessed 5040 fatal traffic accidents, of which 438 were fatal truck accidents. This number has risen from 5039 total traffic accidents and 401 fatal truck accidents for the previous year 2002. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, there were 2233 fatal traffic accidents in 2003, of which 213 were fatal truck accidents, as opposed to corresponding numbers of 2198 and 174 for the year 2002. Florida had 4432 fatal traffic accidents in 2003, with 343 of them involving trucks, which was higher than 4431 total traffic accidents for 2002 but lower than the 351 fatal truck accidents in the same period. The highest number of fatal traffic accidents happened in California, with the number being a staggering 5725 fatal auto accidents in 2003. But at 332, the number of fatal truck accidents was not the highest among all states in the US. Trucking revenues totaled $610 billion last year and revenues are forecasted to nearly double by 2015. The majority of fatal truck accidents occur in rural areas (68 percent) during the daytime (66 percent) and on weekdays (78 percent). In 2002, the majority of large truck crashes occurred in good weather (71 percent), on dry roads (71 percent), during the daytime (75 percent), and on weekdays (88 percent). About 27 percent of all large truck drivers involved in fatal truck accidents throughout the United States had at least one prior speeding conviction compared to 19 percent of the passenger vehicle drivers involved in fatal crashes. From 1992 to 2002, the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes has increased by up to 10% due to driver fatigue, unsafe vehicle operation, large, unstable loads or defective equipment. Defects contribute to the number of large truck accidents each year. Some of these defects include: About 700 heavy truck drivers and passengers in truck cabs die each year. In addition, almost 3,700 persons in cars and other passenger vehicles die annually in collisions with heavy trucks. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that in crashes involving large trucks and other vehicles, 98% of the fatalities occur to the people in passenger vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has warned groups using 15-seat passenger vans about the dangers of fully loading the vans and then putting an inexperienced driver behind the wheel. The NHTSA also stated that 15-passenger vans are large trucks and should only be driven by people with experience driving large trucks. The FMCSA’s Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) classifies a truck as large if its gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) exceeds 10,000 pounds. The majority of fatal crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks include trucks that are pulling one trailer. A recent survey showed that 64% of fatal truck crashes had one trailer. Thirty-two percent of those involved single-unit trucks (no trailer) and fewer than 4% of the those involved multi-trailer vehicles (more than one trailer). Note: All values are approximate, based on available crash data. There were no contributing weather conditions in 84% of Alabama truck accidents.

Approximately five miles from the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rockies and especially Long's Peak.

It was built by Freelan Oscar Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame and opened on July 4, 1909, catering to the American upper class at the turn of the century. The hotel and its surrounding structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Stanley Hotel also hosted the horror novelist Stephen King, serving as inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in his 1977 bestseller The Shining and location for the 1997 miniseries. Today, it includes a restaurant, spa, and bed-and-breakfast and provides guided tours which feature the history and alleged paranormal activity of the site. (From Wikipedia).  The story of the Stanley brothers is one worth reading.  The hotel has a number of rooms open to the public to stay and for business and wedding functions. I’d love to stay there but probably wouldn’t get much sleep. Front lobby. Conference room. Basement where the staff worked.  The guests never saw the staff.  They traveled back and forth in these tunnels. Spooky pictures, but loved them. The Shining still gives me chills up the back of my neck. When did you have time to work? Our guide thought there was something there also, and asked us to send a copy to the management. The mirror thing was super weird.  Lee always wanted to take me there but I was like no way.  See smart lol Ha ha if you spook easy, then this place will get to you. There were a couple of kids in our group and the guide had them run down to the end of the hall and they disappeared and reappeared just like in the movie. What most people don’t know is Stephen King did not like Kubrick’s interpretation of his book, so he shot his own mini series for ABC. “The Shining” mini series ran on ABC in 1997.

Some of these creepy spots are located in the biggest of cities that everyone knows about, and others in small towns that only locals may know of. Take a peek below to check out our Top 10 Haunted Places in the state of Colorado!1. Stanley Hotel - Estes Park, COPhoto by Congovo, via FlickrDating back to 1909, the Stanley Hotel gained fame after being featured in the classic horror film by Stephen King, ""The Shining."" Located just four miles from Rocky Mountain National Park, this hotel features 420 rooms and offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rockies and Long's Peak. The hotel was built by Freelan Oscar Stanley and Flora Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame and opened on July 4, 1909, catering to the American upper class at the turn of the century.It has had a number of haunting reports, and the hotel even hosts guided tours of the place which feature the history and alleged paranormal activity on the property.

A number of rooms have had reported activity, including Room 217 and Room 401, which is said to have a haunted closet where a main is seen standing. A spirit that is believed to be a long term housekeeper of the Stanley's is said to be the spirit lingering in Room 217. Stories say if she likes you, she'll help you unpack your luggage!2.

She also survived the sinking of The Titanic. The home was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was also added to the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties. Dating back to the 1880s, the home was built by architect William A. Lang and is said to be quite haunted.Many believe that one of the ghosts that lingers here is Molly Brown herself, and that her spirit has been seen wandering throughout the house, accompanied by cold spots. In some rooms of the house, pipe and cigar smoke can be smelled, and is attributed to her husband's ghost. There is also the ghost of a lady in Victorian clothing who likes to move the furniture around in the dining room.

Brown Palace Hotel - Denver, CO Photo by beauitfulcataya, via FlickrDenver's Brown Palace Hotel is located on 17th Street and dates back to 1892. The historic hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in April of 1970 and was also added to the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties. According to Wikipedia, it is the second-longest operating hotel in Denver and is one of the first atrium-style hotels ever built. The hotel is rumored to be haunted by a number of ghosts, one of them being a Denver socialite, Mrs. Louise Crawford Hill, who lived in Room 904 for 15 years. Her ghost is known to call the switchboard when the room is vacant, and only static can be heard on the other end. The ghost even called the switchboard from Room 904 when the room was being renovated and had no phone, furniture or lights.Another spirit of the hotel is an old-fashioned train conductor and in the dining room, there is a ghostly string quartet. When an employee caught the formally attired musicians playing in there, he warned them, “You’re not supposed to be in here,” but the ghosts only replied, “Oh, don’t worry about us. We live here.” A uniformed waiter that appears in the service elevator, a crying baby in the boiler room, and ghostly children who run up and down the halls are also among the ghosts of the Brown Palace Hotel. 4.

The cemetery was established in the early 1860s and haunting reports include light anomalies and orbs that appear in photos, sightings of a young boy who is said to follow visitors around, but will run and hide if anyone tries to approach him, and there's also the Lady in Black.

A little girl's apparition has been spotted in the halls of the hotel, playing with a ball, and it is said that the other ghosts like to play tricks on both visitors and staff members.

Stories say there is a ghost of a man wearing a hospital gown that lingers the grounds of the park at night, in search of his killers. He is said to have deep stab wounds in his chest, back and arms. Another strange report is from people who have claimed to experience an odd sensation if they lie down on the grass. They say that after lying down for a short time they feel as though they are unable to stand up. It is almost as though some unseen force is holding them down.7. Hotel Jerome - Aspen, COPhoto by Synthetichem, via FlickrAspen's Hotel Jerome dates back to 1889 and is located at the foot of Aspen Mountain. The luxury hotel is filled with historic heritage, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It was built by Jerome B. Wheeler, who was at the time, co-owner of Macy's and a major investor in Aspen. The establishment is believed to be haunted by a young boy who drowned in the hotel's swimming pool. His ghost is known to haunt Room 310, a room that overlooks the pool. He appears to guests wet and shivering and is said to disappear, leaving only a trail of wet footprints. Other ghosts that are said to haunt the hotel are Katie Kerrigan, a former employee of the hotel and Henry O'Callister, a man who made a fortune in the mining industry. Legend says he moved to Jerome and fell in love with a Boston heiress named Clarissa Wellington. The two wanted to get married, but Clarissa's father refused to allow it. She returned to her father and Henry stayed in Aspen, and his ghost can be heard at night crying and wandering down the halls.8.

The property is believed to be haunted by some lingering spirits, who manifest as cold sots and a phantom tobacco smell that has been reported in the laundry room. And in Cell 19, a female prisoner who died there is said to have never left. Photos have shown ghostly orbs in the cell, and the sound of coughing has been heard coming from the empty cell.9. Imperial Hotel - Cripple Creek, COPhoto by Jasperdo, via FlickrCripple Creek's Imperial Hotel and Restaurant is a family-owned hotel that dates back to the late 1800s. Dr. Luigi is the ghost who is said to reside at the hotel, and he is known to make noise on the second floor. There is also the story of one of the original owners, George Long, and his daughter Alice. George married his first cousin, and Alice was born with a severe mental disorder and the couple locked her in the apartment next to the hotel because she became so unruly. One day, George ""fell"" down the stairs and died, although many believe Alice hit him with a skillet so he would fall. According to Visitcos.com, ""Today, Alice’s old room is the Red Rooster bar. Staff reports if the doors are closed, scratching can be heard on the other side. George’s ghost is a bit cheekier playing the slots at night when the casino is closed and touching lady guests at his leisure. The location was featured on an episode of Travel Channel’s Ghost Hunters.""10. Fitzsimons Army Hospital - Aurora, COPhoto by Tom, via WikiCommonsThis army hospital is no longer in operation but was once a U.S. Army facility located on 577 acres of land. The hospital opened in 1918 and was the largest structure in the state at the time. It closed its doors in 1999 and has since stood abandoned. It was founded during World War I by the U.S. Army after they needed to treat the large number of casualties from chemical weapons in Europe. The hauntings that have been reported here are believed to be attributed to its tragic past, and those lingering in spirit are most likely soldiers who passed away here.

The county’s four biggest cities, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine, and Huntington Beach each have residents exceeding 200,000. Several of Orange County’s cities touch the Pacific coast, including Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and San Clemente. Orange County counts thirty-four incorporated cities; the newest is Aliso Viejo, incorporated in 2001. Anaheim was the first town, incorporated in 1870 when the area was still part of neighboring Los Angeles County. There is no designated urban center in Orange County. It is mostly suburban except for some traditionally urban areas at the hearts of the older cities of Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Orange, and Santa Ana. There are several edge developments such as Irvine Business Center, South Coast Metro and Newport Center. The county is known for tourism with attractions like Knott’s Berry Farm, Disneyland, and several famous beaches adjacent its more than 40 miles (64 km) of coastline. It is part of the Tech Coast. Members of the Juaneño, Tongva, and Luiseño Native American groups long occupied the area. After the 1769 voyage of Gaspar de Portolà, a Spanish expedition led by Junipero Serra named the region Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne). On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano became the region’s first perpetual European settlement. Amongst those who came with Portolá were José Antonio Yorba and José Manuel Nieto. Both these obtained land grants—Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana and Rancho Los Nietos, respectively. The Nieto ranches, known as Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Las Bolsas, and Rancho Los Coyotes. Yorba inheritors Teodosio Yorba and Bernardo Yorba were also given Rancho Lomas de Santiago and Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana, respectively. The Mexican government granted other ranchos in Orange County during the Mexican period in Alta California. A severe drought in the 1860s crushed the regular industry, cattle ranching, and much land came into the ownership of Richard O’Neill, Sr., James Irvine and other land barons. In 1887, silver was discovered in the Santa Ana Mountains, attracting immigrants via the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads. This extension led the California legislature to divide Los Angeles County and create Orange County as a different political entity on March 11, 1889. The county is said, owes its name for the citrus fruit to promote immigration by suggesting a tropical paradise–a place where anything could grow. Other citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County profited from the July 4, 1904, completion of the Pacific Electric Railway, a trolley linking Los Angeles with Newport Beach and Santa Ana. The link made Orange County a convenient weekend escape for celebrities of early Hollywood. It was so important that Pacific City replaced its name with Huntington Beach in honor of Henry E. Huntington, chairman of the Pacific Electric and nephew of Collis Huntington. Transport further developed with the conclusion of the State Route and U.S. Route 101 (now mostly Interstate 5) in the 1920s. Agriculture, such as that comprising the boysenberries made famous by Buena Park native Walter Knott, began to decline after World War II. However, the county’s success soared during this time. The completion of Interstate 5 in 1954 helped make Orange County a bedroom neighborhood for many who settled in Southern California to work in aerospace and manufacturing. Orange County got a further lift in 1955 with the opening of Disneyland. In 1969, Yorba Linda saw Richard Nixon born in Orange County who became the 37th President of the United States. In the 1980s, Orange County became the second most populated county in California as the population surpassed two million for the first time. In 1994, an investment fund calamity led to the criminal prosecution of trustee Robert Citron. The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk purchases in bonds. The loss was imputed on derivatives by some media news. On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy, from which it emerged on June 12, 1996. The Orange County bankruptcy was at that moment, the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Recently, land use disputes have arisen between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts have issues such as the construction of new toll roads and the re-direction of a decommissioned air base. El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was assigned by a voter measure in 1994 to be expanded into an international airport to complement the current John Wayne Airport. However, voter initiatives and court actions caused the airport plan to be permanently suspended. Instead, it became the Orange County Great Park.",,,,,,,,,

what is the full form of lg electronics,"In 1995, to compete better in the Western market, the Lucky-GoldStar Corporation was renamed ""LG"". The company also associates the letters LG with the company's tagline ""Life's Good"". Since 2009, LG has owned the domain name LG.com.","The most common reason is when the original business has expanded. Either as part of a merger, acquisition, or simply as part of stellar growth plans that includes new product lines or service options. When this happens, the original brand name may no longer fit and a new or modified name is required. Of course, going back to the drawing board isn’t always the best option, particularly when there are years of equity invested in the name. However, if your brand name no longer reflects your business, take the time to consider what new name would appeal to your customer base and is reflective of your company. Research published in the Harvard Business Review highlights how getting it wrong can have catastrophic consequences. Accenture began as a division of Arthur Andersen. Following an acronymous split, the company Accenture was formed. The word “Accenture” is supposedly derived from the phrase “Accent on the future”. The name was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company’s Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates. LG Corp. was originally established as Rak-Hui (pronounced ‘Lucky’) Chemical Industrial Corp. As the company expanded, it established GoldStar Co. Ltd. Both companies, Lucky and GoldStar, merged and formed Lucky-GoldStar. In 1995, to compete better in the Western market, the Lucky-GoldStar Corporation was renamed “LG”. The company also associates the letters LG with the company’s tagline “Life’s Good”. Since 2009, LG has owned the domain name LG.com. 2. No Longer Accurate, or Limiting Companies that change names to be a better reflection of their current operation make up the second largest group of name changes. Such changes occur when businesses want consumers and investors to get a better idea of who they are and what they’re doing. When a name has a geographic reference in it that is no longer relevant or limiting, when the name references a partner who is no longer with the company, or to better reflect changes in consumer trends. When fried food fell out of favour, Kentucky Fried Chicken had to change their name to KFC. When Google needed to create a brand bigger than search – they changed their parent brand to Alphabet. A simpler name has many benefits. It’s easier to say and in some cases, can take up less space on social media commentary making it more likely to be used in full. When Citigroup changed its name to Citi it was trying to offer customers a more user-friendly, memorable name. One of its first orders of business was to rename the Mets ballpark to Citi Field. Renaming the company was an effort to create a brand name that could cover its myriad of interests, including Citi Smith Barney, Citi Investment Research and Citi Private Bank. ‘Citi’ is just easier. 4. U-Turn When companies, through natural progression or force of competitive pressure, become focussed on a new venture or change of direction, a brand name change is an excellent way of signalling change. More businesses than you might imagine started out as one thing, then evolved into something quite different. And, in order to be relevant to that new target audience, their old names had to go. Just ask Twitter – formerly Odeo, PayPal – formerly Confinity PDF Payments, Flickr – previously called Game Neverending or Pinterest formerly Tote. In some cases, a business group, with a number of companies under its umbrella might change their brand name to the one part of its group that’s the most successful – leveraging an iconic brand. This a good strategy that can bring some trust to the overall brand name, rather than just hoarding it for the one business. Brand leveraging is an important part of any company’s marketing strategy and thus, should be used when required. This was the winning strategy we adopted when changing our client’s name from AB Food and Beverages to Twinings & Co. The most effective names are often easy to remember and easy to pronounce. Many brands change or shorten their name to make them more appealing to consumers. This is the same strategy that led National Australia Bank to become NAB and America Online to become AOL. According to Al Ries, ‘A brand is what consumers call it.’ ‘Instead of trying to force-feed a nickname to consumers, a company needs to wait for them to popularize one. Coca-Cola, for example, didn’t put “Coke” on its bottles until after people began calling the product that.’ In some cases, when a company is ‘broken’ or wants to distance itself from a scandal or negative association, a new name can be a catalyst for positive change. But, this tactic comes with mixed results. What worked for ValuJet when they changed to AirTran Airways, failed miserably for Altria, previously Philip Morris. As you can see, there are numerous reasons as to why successful businesses and brands change their names. Changing a brand name can be one of the most challenging and daunting decisions a company can ever undertake. There are many challenges, but if you can overcome them, the results can surpass even the highest of expectations.
