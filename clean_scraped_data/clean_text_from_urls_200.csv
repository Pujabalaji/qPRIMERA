what is the definition of latent heat of fusion,"Latent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. Examples are latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization involved in phase changes, i.e. a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure.",,,,,,,,,,
where did the tradition of an inaugural address come from,"The first inauguration, that of George Washington, took place on April 30, 1789. All subsequent (regular) inaugurations from 1793 until 1933, were held on March 4, the day of the year on which the federal government began operations under the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The exception to this pattern being those years in which March 4 fell on a Sunday. When it did, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5. This happened on four occasions, in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917. Inauguration Day moved to January 20, beginning in 1937, following ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, where it has remained since. A similar Sunday exception and move to Monday is made around this date as well (which happened in 1957, 1985, and 2013).","The page you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed or is temporarily unavailable. © Copyright  Best Brains.

The American Revolution set off a contagion that manifested in Europe with the French Revolution beginning on the July 14, 1789. The first inauguration of George Washington took place on April 30, 1789. So if we take the Cycle of Political Change from 1789, that brings us up to a rather important event of a national hero who was called a traitor and risked being killed or imprisoned for life, exactly as King George III declared. George III declared Thomas Jefferson and everyone else who signed the Declaration of Independence, which Jefferson wrote, a traitor. Snowden could only go to Russia for security for any other country would have turned him over. George III sent an entire army to personally capture Jefferson and hang him. Fortunately, he was warned that an entire army was converging on his home and he had time to flee. That hero reappeared on May 20, 2013, precisely 224 years on cue from 1789. That hero is Edward Snowden for what he revealed was not just that the United States was unconstitutionally violating every right of every American citizen; it was a worldwide cooperation among nations to hunt down their own people because they could feel the reins of power slipping from their grip. They say history produces the heroes we need at critical moments; perhaps this is true. One is hard-pressed to find so many brilliant minds coming together, as was the case in 1776, as we saw with people like Jefferson, Ben Franklin, James Madison, and even Thomas Paine whose words moved a nation along with those of Patrick Henry – Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death. Hopefully, there will be others who step forward over the next four years to lend a hand once again. We face a very dark new age of totalitarianism where government is crushing all rights to preserve their privileges and power.",Looks like something went wrong.,"Barack Obama will be inaugurated in front of hundreds of thousands of people on Jan. 21, but here's a little secret: That's just ceremonial. He will actually be sworn in 24 hours beforehand, in what is sure to be a much smaller ceremony. That's because the Constitution's 20th Amendment specifies that a presidential term begins on Jan. 20 each year. Since that date falls on a Sunday, the big production was pushed back a day. Which means when Obama puts his hand on the Bible in front of a national TV audience and repeats after Chief Justice John Roberts, it will just be a rerun. For an event that's essentially etched in stone every four years, the history behind the inauguration date is surprisingly fascinating. It's moved up more than three months since George Washington's first in April 1789, but despite mind-blowing advancements in technology, there's still nearly a three-month gap between election day and inauguration day. And experts say that gap isn't likely to shrink. Our first presidential election began on Dec. 15, 1788, and voting didn’t end until Jan. 10. Though George Washington's victory was a forgone conclusion, it wouldn't be confirmed for weeks to come. ""The long struggle to ratify the Constitution delayed the selection of the Electoral College until January 1789 and the electors did not meet in their state capitals until March,"" said John Ferling, author of 'The Ascent of George Washington: The Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon.' ""The Senate then had to count the ballots, and that was not done until early April."" Washington got word of his election on April 14, and arrived in New York on April 23. A week later, on April 30, he was inaugurated. Even though Washington wasn't inaugurated until April, his first term technically ended four years after the Constitution was ratified. So for Washington's second term -- and every inauguration for the next 144 years -- Inauguration Day was held on March 4, the anniversary of the Constitution's ratification (or March 5, if the 4th fell on a Sunday). Though this shaved 47 days off the interregnum (the period between the election and the inauguration), the nation would still find itself saddled with a lame duck president for months on end. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president on Nov. 6, 1860, the nation was teetering on the brink of war, and it would be four months before he could take the reins. During that time, seven states seceded, formed the Confederate States of America, and, two weeks before Lincoln's inauguration, selected Jefferson Davis as their own president. It would take another nation-defining crisis before anyone would do anything to address the issue. In 1932, with the Great Depression crushing the economy, Sen. George Norris, an independent from Nebraska, proposed what became known as the ""Lame Duck"" amendment, seeking to move up inauguration day to Jan. 20. ""He was very coy during that interregnum, where Hoover was trying to get him to sign on and start wielding authority before he had authority,"" Clark said. ""And FDR, politically, did not want to be boxed in by being seen to endorse the policies… to avoid the perception that (he) was in any way responsible for what was going on."" Eighty years later, with the advent of the Internet and private jets, the outcome of a presidential election is usually known hours after polls close, and the president-elect can get to D.C. by noon the following day. But presidential inaugurations are still held on Jan. 20 -- exposing America to nearly three months of lame duck presidency. Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at Yale University, says this is due to vagaries of the Electoral College, a system he described as ""ridiculous"" and ""antiquated."" Ackerman, who worked for Al Gore during the disputed 2000 election, says the Electoral College requires time to mitigate disputes in close elections. ""You need time to resolve this,"" Ackerman said. ""The statute at the present time requires, if the states want to have the returns unchallenged at subsequent proceedings, they have to hand them in by the middle of December."" Ackerman said we should look to the rest of the world to find a system of Democratic elections that is fast and efficient. ""See how the French do it,"" he said. ""If you look at any modern democracy other than ours, just copy their system. It has all the features you're describing."" In France, from election day to inauguration takes about 24 days, and that's despite often having a second round of voting in between. Think how nice it'd be to hold the Inaugural parade on Nov. 30, when the average temperature in DC is a balmy 52. But be prepared to actually watch that parade in chilly January weather.","The President of the United States is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by the people through an Electoral College (or by the House of Representatives, should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person). Since the office was established in 1789, 43 people have served as president. The first, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms in office, and is counted as the nation's 22nd and 24th president. William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, dying 31 days after taking office in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945; he is the only president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[1] The current president is Barack Obama, and the president-elect is Donald Trump,[2] whose term of office will commence on January 20, 2017. Of the individuals elected as president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison,[3] Zachary Taylor,[4] Warren G. Harding,[5] and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,[6] James A. Garfield,[6][7] William McKinley,[8] and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon).[9] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency intra-term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning  president with his own presidency, as opposed to a caretaker president. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution put Tyler's precedent into law in 1967. It also established a mechanism by which an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon was the first president to fill a vacancy under this Provision when he appointed Gerald Ford to the office. Later, Ford became the second to do so when he appointed Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him. Previously, an intra-term vacancy was left unfilled. Presently, there are four living former presidents. The most recent death of a former president was that of Gerald Ford (served 1974 to 1977) on December 26, 2006 (aged 93 years, 165 days). The most recently serving president to die was Ronald Reagan (served 1981 to 1989) on June 5, 2004 (aged 93 years, 120 days). Jimmy Carter currently holds the record for having the longest post-presidency of any president. Four presidents held other high U.S. federal offices after leaving the presidency. Additionally, several presidents campaigned unsuccessfully for other U.S. state or federal elective offices after leaving the presidency.",,,,,
a primary purpose of the law enforcement assistance administration (leaa) was to,"The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) was a U.S. federal agency within the U.S. Dept. of Justice. It administered federal funding to state and local law enforcement agencies and funded educational programs, research, state planning agencies, and local crime initiatives as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on crime.","Reading of the death of former pro boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter today awoke an old memory which reminded me how lucky I was to have, what in retrospect, was a pretty cool father.  I should add by “cool” I do not mean some kind of “over the hill hipster” who, in a desperate attempt at trying to stay relevant smokes pot or acts in some other immature, out of character way.  No, I merely mean a father, that despite whatever busy schedule he may have, when he senses that something is of importance, at least to his kid, takes the time to listen and if possible, act on his child’s request or concern. The time was the mid-late70’s (circa 1976-77) and my father had a new job working for the LEAA after years working as chief counsel of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee and later as a staff counsel for the full judiciary committee.  The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) was a short-lived U.S. federal agency within the Justice Department.  It administered federal funding to state and local law enforcement agencies, and funded educational programs, research, state planning agencies and local crime initiatives.  My father really had no qualifications for working for the LEAA other than being one of the principal authors of the Senate’s Amendment to the Omnibus Crime Control Act and needing a job. At the time I was a long haired, anti-establishment teenager with a new favorite lp, Bob Dylan’s “Desire”.  My motivation for purchasing this album was the wordy but endearing protest song which was the album’s featured single, “Hurricane” written by Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy: The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed Like any teenager with a new record, “Desire” was in heavy rotation and much like the songs off my early Springsteen collection, “Hurricane” was one of those songs you had to memorize the lyrics to.  (My poor parents!)  So after about a month of this constant barrage I honestly can’t remember who approached whom, whether I asked my Dad or Dad came to me and said something like”…if you just stop playing that damn song, I’ll see what I can find out…”.  Which ever it was, in retrospect it was pretty damn cool of the old man and I know it did not win him many friends at his new job poking around this subject with state and federal law enforcement officials. Out of respect to the friends and family of Mr. Carter and in all fairness, I will not repeat the hearsay my father reported back to me other than to confirm the early acknowledgment by those in law enforcement (F.B.I.) of serious problems with the State’s case.  The thing that is important to me today, some 15 years after my father’s passing, is what a cool thing that was for my Dad to do for his son.  RIP Rubin.  I’m so glad you got out of that cell.

where did the name machu picchu come from,"In the Quechua language, machu means ""old"" or ""old person"", while picchu means ""peak; mountain or prominence with a broad base that ends in sharp peaks"", hence the name of the site means ""old peak"".","Machu Picchu (Quechua: Machu Pikchu) is a 15th-century Inca citadel situated on a mountain ridge 2,430 metres (7,970 ft) above sea level. It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru, above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the ""Lost City of the Incas"" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared. By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day. Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll. In the Quechua language, machu means ""old"" or ""old person"", while pikchu means ""peak; mountain or prominence with a broad base that ends in sharp peaks"", hence the name of the site means ""old peak"". Machu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca. Its construction appears to date to the period of the two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–71) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–93). It was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travellers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area. Although it was located only about 80 kilometers (50 mi) from the Inca capital in Cusco, the Spanish never found Machu Picchu and so did not plunder or destroy it, as they did many other sites. The conquistadors had notes of a place called Piccho, although no record of a Spanish visit exists. The types of sacred rocks defaced by the conquistadors in other locations are untouched at Machu Picchu. Over the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns. Some evidence indicates that German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874. In 1911 American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham travelled the region looking for the old Inca capital and was led to Machu Picchu by a local farmer. Bingham brought Machu Picchu to international attention and organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation. He returned in 1914 and 1915 to continue with excavation. In 1981, Peru declared an area of 325.92 square kilometres (125.84 sq mi) surrounding Machu Picchu a ""Historic Sanctuary"". In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the flora and fauna of the Peruvian Yungas and Central Andean wet puna ecoregions. In 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a World Heritage Site, describing it as ""an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization"". Bingham was a lecturer at Yale University, although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he traveled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at Choqquequirau in the Apurímac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of Vitcos. He consulted Carlos Romero, a historian in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father Calancha’s Chronicle. Armed with this information the expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins. By the time they camped at Mandor Pampa, with Huayna Picchu 2000 feet above them on the opposite bank, they had already examined several ruins, but none fit the descriptions of Vitcos. At Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu. The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Huayna Picchu mountain. At the top of the mountain they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of Quechua, Richarte and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins. The ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unclear about the original purpose of the ruins, but decided that there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos. The expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, Vitcos (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of Chuquipalta. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at Espíritu Pampa, which he named ""Eromboni Pampa"". As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, Gene Savoy further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as Vilcabamba Viejo where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos. On the return of the expedition up the Urubamba River, Bingham sent two men to clear and map the site he referred to as Machu Picchu. As Bingham failed to identify the ruins at Espiritu Pampa as Vilcabamba Viejo, he erroneously theorized that Machu Picchu was Vilcabamba Viejo. Machu Picchu features spectacular workmanship and a dramatic site, while Vilcabamba was built while the short-lived remnant Neo-Inca State was being vanquished by the Spanish; it was built quickly and features crude workmanship. Bingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic and with full support of Peruvian President Leguia. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labor, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cuzco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy. Although local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice. Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. (In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum.) Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history. Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators. By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions. Little information describes human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements. However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife. Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were much more common, made at the Altar of the Condor. The tradition is upheld by members of the New Age Andean religion. Machu Picchu lies in the southern hemisphere, 13.164 degrees south of the equator. It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,600 metres (11,800 ft). As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru. Machu Picchu has wet and dry seasons, with the majority of annual rain falling from October through to April. Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 metres (1,480 ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river. The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 metres (20 ft). It could be bridged by two tree trunks, but with the trees removed, there was a 570 metres (1,870 ft) fall to the base of the cliffs. The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu, with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily, and enough land to grow food for about four times as many people as ever lived there. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops, and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides. Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them. The site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, and into an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower. The architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east-west central square. The various compounds, called kanchas, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the Torreón, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory. Located in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows. These were dedicated to Inti, their sun god and greatest deity. The Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses. The royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the amautas (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the ñustas (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices. The Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the wayrona style. In 2005 and 2009, the University of Arkansas made detailed laser scans of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes. The Intihuatana stone is one of many ritual stones in South America. These stones are arranged to point directly at the sun during the winter solstice. The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from Quechua language: inti means ""sun"", and wata-, ""to tie, hitch (up)"". The suffix -na derives nouns for tools or places. Hence Intihuatana is literally an instrument or place to ""tie up the sun"", often expressed in English as ""The Hitching Post of the Sun"". The Inca believed the stone held the sun in its place along its annual path in the sky. The stone is situated at 13°9'48"" S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the sun stands almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side. Inti Mach'ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of Qhapaq Raymi. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sun rise. Architecturally, Inti Mach'ay is the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to only allow sunlight into the cave during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year. Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the ""Condor Stone."" Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground. The central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar. The section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site, lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms; and outside corners were often tied together by ""L""-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top. Heavy rainfall required terraces and stone chips to drain rain water and prevent mud slides, landslides, erosion and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt and top soil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding. Multiple canals and reserves provide water throughout the city that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding. The Incas never used wheels in a practical way, although its use in toys shows that they knew the principle. Its use in engineering may have been limited due to the lack of strong draft animals, steep terrain and dense vegetation. The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; after which they were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked. The Inca road system included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the Titicaca or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru. Thousands of tourists walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year. They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from Kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four/five-day trip) or Kilometer 104 (one/two-day trip) near the town of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes to the isolated city.

Perhaps hardware floating-point support? Interesting question with an interesting answer. It's a myth to suggest C's design is based on the PDP-11. People often quote, for example, the increment and decrement operators because they have an analogue in the PDP-11 instruction set. This is, however, a coincidence. Those operators were invented before the language was ported to the PDP-11. In the former category we have most of the interesting eventual dead ends in computer hardware history. Perhaps the one of the earliest examples of a CPU architecture being targeted at a high level language is the Burroughs B5000 and its successors. This is a family of machines targeted at Algol. In fact, there wasn't really a machine language as such that you could program in. The B5000 had a lot of hardware features designed to support the implementation of Algol. It had a hardware stack and all data manipulations were performed on the stack. It used tagged descriptors for data so the CPU had some idea of what it was dealing with. It had a series of registers called display registers that were used to model static scope* efficiently. Other examples of machines targeted at specific languages include the Lisp machine already mentioned, arguably the Cray series of supercomputers for Fortran - or even just Fortran loops, the ICL 2900 series (also block structured high level languages), some machines targeted at the Java virtual machine (some ARM processors have hardware JVM support) and many others. One of the drivers behind creating RISC architectures was the observation that compilers tended to use only a small subset of the available combinations of instructions and addressing modes available on most CPU architectures, so RISC designers ditched the unused ones and filled the space previously used for complex decoding logic with more registers. In the second category, we have individual features in processors targeted at high level languages. For example, the hardware stack is a useful feature for an assembly language programmer, but more or less essential for any language that allows recursive function calls. The processor may build features on top of that for example, many CPUs have an instruction to create a stack frame (the data structure on the stack that represents a function's parameters and local variables). *Algol allowed you to declare functions inside other functions. Static scope reflects the way functions were nested in the program source - an inner function could access the variables and functions defined in it and in the scope in which it was defined and the scope in which that scope was defined all the way up to global scope. And not just a few instructions, but whole CPUs have been developed with languages in mind. Most prominent maybe Intel's 8086. Already the basic CPU was designed to support the way high level languages handle memory management, especially stack allocation and usage. With BP a separate register for stack frames and addressing was added in conjunction with short encodings for stack related addressing to make HLL programs perform. The 80186/286 went further in this direction by adding Enter/Leave instructions for stack frame handling. While it can be said that the base 8086 was geared more toward languages like Pascal or PL/M (*1,2), later incarnations added many ways to support the now prevalent C primitives - not at least scaling factors for indices. Since many answers pile now various details of CPUs where instructions may match up (or not), there are maybe two other CPUs worth mentioning: The Pascal Microengine and Rockwells 65C19 (as well as the RTX2000). The Pascal Microengine was a WD MCP1600 chipset (*3) based implementation of the virtual 16 bit UCSD p-code processor. Contrary to what the name suggests, it wasn't tied to Pascal as a language, but a generic stack machine tailored to support concepts for HLL operations. Beside a rather simple, stack based execution, the most important part was a far reaching and comfortable management of local memory structures for functions and function linking as well as data. Modern time Java Bytecode and its interpreter as a native Bytecode CPU (e.g. PicoJava) isn't in any way a new idea (*4). The Rockwell R65C19 is a 6500 variant with added support for Forth. Its 10 new threaded code instructions (*5) implemented the core functions (like Next) of a Forth system as single machine instructions. Forth as a language was developed with a keen eye on the way it is executed. It got more in common with Assemblers than many other HLL (*6). So it's no surprise that, already in 1983, its inventor Charles Moore created a Forth CPU called N4000 (*7). *1 - Most remarkable here the string functions which make only sense in languages supporting strings as discrete data type. *2 - Stephen Morse's 8086 primer is still a good read - especially when he talks about the finer details. Similar and quite recommended his 2008 interview about the 8086 creation where he describes his approach as mostly HLL driven. *3 - Which makes it basically a LSI-11 with different microcode. *4 - As IT historians, we have seen each and every implementation already before, haven't we? So let's play a round of Zork. *5 - There are other nice additions as well, like mathematical operations that ease filter programming - after all, the 65C19/29/39 series was the heart of many modems. *6 - The discrimination with assembler as not being a HLL and miles apart becomes quite blurry when looking close anyway. *7 - Later sold to Harris, who developed it into the RTX2000 series - with radiation hardened versions that power several deep space probes. One interesting example of programming languages driving hardware development is the LISP machine. Since ""normal"" computers of the time period couldn't execute lisp code efficiently, and there was a high demand for the language in academia and research, dedicated hardware was built with the sole purpose of executing lisp code. Although lisp machines were initially developed for MIT's AI lab, they also saw sucess in computer animation. These computers provided increased speed by using a stack machine instead of the typical register based design, and had native support for type checking lisp types. Some other important hardware features aided in garbage collection and closures. Here's a series of slides that go into more detail on the design: Architecture of Lisp Machines (PDF) (archive). The architecture of these computers are specialized enough that in order to run c code, the c source is transpiled into lisp, and then run normally. The Vacietis compiler is an example of such a system. Yes.  Case in point, the VAX.  The instruction set design was influenced by the requirements of the compiled languages of the day.  For example, the orthogonality of the ISA; the provision of instructions that map to language constructs such as 'case' statements (in the numbered-case sense of Hoare's original formulation, not the labelled-case of C), loop statements, and so on. VAX Architecture Ref - see the Introduction. I am not claiming the VAX is unique in this respect, just an example I know a little about. As a second example, I'll mention the Burroughs B6500 'display' registers.  A display, in 1960s speak, is a mechanism for efficient uplevel references. If your language, such as Algol60, permits declaration of nested procedures to any depth, then arbitrary references to the local variables of different levels of enclosing procedure require special handling.  The mechanism used (the 'display') was invented for KDF9 Whetstone Algol by Randell and Russell, and described in their book Algol 60 Implementation. The B6500 incorporates that into hardware: In particular, C and other high-level languages use the stack for arguments and local variables.  The 8086 has both a stack pointer (SP) and a frame pointer (BP) which address memory using the stack segment (SS) rather than other segments (CS, DS, ES). Programs for the 8087 can be written in Intel's high-level languages for 8086/8088 and 80186/80188 systems; ASM-86 (the 8086, 8088 assembly language), PL/M-86, FORTRAN-86, and PASCAL-86. The 80186 added several instructions to the architecture to aid high-level languages.  PUSHA, POPA, ENTER, and LEAVE help with subroutine calls.  The BOUND instruction was useful for array bounds checking and switch-style control statements.  Other instructions unrelated to high-level languages were added as well. The 80386 added bitfield instructions, which are used in C. 2.2.2  Structured Modular Programming The 68020 added bitfield instructions, which are used in C. Whereas the above processors added instructions to support programming languages, Reduced Instruction-Set Computers (RISC) took the opposite approach.  By analyzing which instructions compilers actually used, they were able to discard many complex instructions that weren't being used.  This allowed the architecture to be simplified, shorten the instruction cycle length, and reduce instructions to one cycle, speeding up processors significantly. When C was invented, many different string forms were in used at the same time. String operations were probably handled mostly in software, therefore people can use whatever format they want. Null-terminated string wasn't a new idea, however special hardware support, if any, might not be meant for it. This had some influence on CPU instruction set design. Some CPUs in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Zilog Z80 and the DEC VAX, had dedicated instructions for handling length-prefixed strings. However, as the NUL-terminated string gained traction, CPU designers began to take it into account, as seen for example in IBM's decision to add the ""Logical String Assist"" instructions to the ES/9000 520 in 1992. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string#History On x86 Intel introduced many instructions for text processing in SSE4.2, which do things in parallel until the first null-termination character. Before that there was the SCAS - scan string instruction that can be used to look for the position of the termination character https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190130-00/?p=100825 We all know that nowadays it's a bad idea. Unfortunately it was baked into C, hence used by every modern platform and can't be changed anymore. Luckily we have std::string in C++ http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp7/PDP-7_AsmMan.pdf However a real null-termination character can be seen in used on the PDP-8 (see the last line in the code block). Then the ASCIZ keyword was introduced in the assembly language for PDP-10/11 Null-terminated strings were produced by the .ASCIZ directive of the PDP-11 assembly languages and the ASCIZ directive of the MACRO-10 macro assembly language for the PDP-10. These predate the development of the C programming language, but other forms of strings were often used. Dennis M. Ritchie, Development of the C Language Arguably, VLIW architectures were designed mainly for smart compilers. They rely on efficient building of individual very complex instructions (a single ""instruction"" can do many things at the same time), and while it's not impossible to write the code manually, the idea was that you could get better performance for your applications by using a better compiler, rather than having to upgrade your CPU. In principle, the difference between e.g. a x86 superscalar CPU and something like SHARC or i860 is that x86 achieves instruction level parallelism at runtime, while SHARC is a very simple CPU design (comparatively) that relies on the compiler. In both cases, there's many tricks to reorder instructions, rename registers etc. to allow multiple instructions to run at the same time, while still appearing to execute them sequentially. The VLIW approach would be especially handy in theory for platforms like JVM or .NET, which use a just-in-time compiler - every update to .NET or JVM could make all your applications faster by allowing better optimizations. And of course, during compilation, the compiler has a lot better idea of what all of your application is trying to do, while the runtime approach only ever has a small subset to work with, and has to rely on techniques like statistical branch prediction. In practice, the approach of having the CPU decide won out. This does make the CPUs incredibly complex, but it's a lot easier to just buy a new better CPU than to recompile or update all your applications; and frankly, it's a lot easier to sell a compatible CPU that just runs your applications faster :) Some ARM CPUs used to have partial support for executing Java bytecode in hardware with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazelle Direct Bytecode eXecution (DBX). With modern JITing JVMs, that became obsolete, so there was later a variant of Thumb2 mode (compact 16-bit instructions) called ThumbEE designed as a JIT target for managed languages like Java and C# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Thumb_Execution_Environment_(ThumbEE) Apparently ThumbEE has automatic NULL-pointer checks, and an array-bounds instruction.  But that was deprecated, too, in 2011. Over time, there have been various language-specific CPUs, some so dedicated that it would be awkward to use them for a different language. For example, the Harris RTX-2000 was designed to run Forth.  One could almost say it and other Forth CPUs were the language in hardware form. I'm not saying they understand the language, but they are designed to execute it at the ""assembler"" level. Early on, Forth was known for being extremely memory efficient, fast, and, for programmers who could think bass-ackwards, quick to develop in. Having a CPU that could execute it almost directly was a no-brainer. However, memory got cheaper, CPU's got quicker, and programmers who liked thinking Forth got scarcer.  (How many folks still use calculators in reverse Polish notation mode?) Arguably, the relatively simple logical structure of DO loops in Fortran motivated the development of vector hardware on the early Cray and Cyber supercomputers. There may be some ""chicken and egg"" between hardware and software development though, since CDC Fortran included array slicing operations to encourage programmers to write ""logic-free"" loops long before that syntax became standardized in Fortran 90. Certainly the Cray XMP hardware enhancements compared with the Cray 1, such as improved ""chaining"" (i.e. overlapping in time) of vector operations, vector mask instructions, and gather/scatter vector addressing, were aimed at improving the performance of typical code written in ""idiomatic"" Fortran. The need to find a way to overcome the I/O bottlenecks caused by faster computation, without the prohibitive expense of large fast memory, led to the development of the early Cray SSD storage devices as an intermediate level between main memory conventional disk and tape storage devices. Fortran I/O statements made it easy to read and write a random-access file as if it were a large two-dimensional array of data. See section 2 of http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/ccd/supercomputers/p005.htm for an 1988 paper by the head of the Cray XMP design team. There was a downside to this, in that the performance of the first Cray C compilers (and hence the first implementation of the Unix-like Cray operating system UNICOS) was abysmal, since the hardware had no native character-at-a-time instructions, and there was little computer science theory available to attempt to vectorize idiomatic ""C-style"" loops with a relatively unstructured combination of pointer manipulation and logical tests, compared with Fortran's more rigidly structured DO loops. Another specific example of hardware design to match the languages was Rekursiv, which was designed to implement object oriented language features in hardware. Our Rekursiv has been preserved in a museum. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekursiv I recall, back in the 80’s, and referenced in the Wikipedia article, Bellmac 32 CPU, which became the AT&T Western Electric WE32100 CPU was supposedly designed for the C programming language. This CPU was used by AT&T in their 3B2 line of Unix systems. There was also a single board VME bus version of it that some third parties used. Zilog also came out with a line of Unix systems using this chip - I think they were a second source for it for AT&T. I did a lot of work with these in the 80’s and probably early 90’s. It was pretty much a dog in terms of performance, if I remember. In the past it was common for computers to be decimal or have instructions for decimal operations. For example x86 has AAM, AAD, AAA, FBLD... for operating on packed, unpacked and 10-byte BCD values. Many other classic architectures also have similar features Several microprocessor families offer limited decimal support. For example, the 80x86 family of microprocessors provide instructions to convert one-byte BCD numbers (packed and unpacked) to binary format before or after arithmetic operations.[3] These operations were not extended to wider formats and hence are now slower than using 32-bit or wider BCD 'tricks' to compute in BCD (see [1]). The x87 FPU has instructions to convert 10-byte (18 decimal digits) packed decimal data, although it then operates on them as floating-point numbers. The Motorola 68000 provided instructions for BCD addition and subtraction;[4] as does the 6502. In the much later 68000 family-derived processors, these instructions were removed when the Coldfire instruction set was defined, and all IBM mainframes also provide BCD integer arithmetic in hardware. The Zilog Z80, Motorola 6800 and its derivatives, together with other 8-bit processors, and also the Intel x86 family have special instructions that support conversion to and from BCD. The Psion Organiser I handheld computer’s manufacturer-supplied software implemented its floating point operations in software using BCD entirely. All later Psion models used binary only, rather than BCD. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_computer#More_modern_computers However they're rarely used, since modern languages often don't have a way to access those instructions. They either lack a decimal integer type completely (like C or Pascal), or doesn't have a decimal type that can map cleanly to BCD instructions The result is that BCD instructions started to disappear. In x86 they're micro-coded, therefore very slow, which makes people further avoid them. Later AMD removed BCD instructions in x64-64. Other manufacturers did the same in newer versions of their architectures. Having said that, a remnant of BCD operations is still there in the FLAGS register in x86-64 and many other platforms that use flags: the half-carry flag. Newly implemented architectures like ARM, MIPS, Sparc, RISC-V also didn't get any BCD instructions and most of them don't use a flag register In fact C and C++ allow float, double and long double to be decimal, however none of the implementations use it for the default floating-point types, because modern computers are all binary and are bad at decimal operations. Very few architectures have decimal floating-point support Many C and C++ compilers do have decimal floating-point types as an extension, such as gcc with _Decimal32, _Decimal64, and _Decimal128. Similarly some other modern languages also have decimal types, however those are mostly big floating-point types for financial or scientific problems and not an integer BCD type. For example decimal in C# is a floating-point type with the mantissa stored in binary, thus BCD instructions would be no help here. Arbitrary-precision decimal types like BigInteger in C# and BigDecimal in Ruby or Java also store the mantissa as binary instead of decimal for performance. A few languages do have a fixed-point decimal monetary type, but the significant part is also in binary That said, a few floating-point formats can still be stored in BCD or a related form. For example the mantissa in IEEE-754 decimal floating-point types can be stored in either binary or DPD (a highly-packed decimal format which can then be converted to BCD easily). However I doubt that decimal IEEE-754 libraries use BCD instructions, because they're often not exist at all in modern computers, or in case they really exist they'd be extremely slow BCD was used in many early decimal computers, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the IBM System/360 series and its descendants, Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX, the Burroughs B1700, and the Motorola 68000-series processors. Although BCD per se is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as ARM; x86 does not support its BCD instructions in long mode any more), decimal fixed-point and floating-point formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and fractional rounding errors that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal#Other_computers_and_BCD Yes, definitely. A very good example is how Motorola moved from the 68k architecture to the (somewhat) compatible ColdFire range of CPUs. (It is also an example of how such an evolution might go wrong, but that is another story). The Motorola Coldfire range of CPUs and Microcontrollers was basically a 68000 CPU32 core with lots of instructions and addressing modes removed that ""normal"" C compilers wouldn't use frequently (like arithmetic instructions on byte and word operands, some complex addressing modes and addressing modes that act only on memory in favor of registers,...). They also simplified the supervisor mode model and removed some rarely used instructions completely. The whole instruction set was ""optimized for C and C++ compilers"" (This is how Motorola put it) and the freed up chip space used to train the CPUs for performance (like with adding larger data and instruction caches). In the end, the changes made the CPUs quite a bit too incompatible for customers to stay within the product family, and the MC68k range of CPUs went towards its demise. Yet another example: The Prime minicomputer had a segmented architecture, and anything in segment 07777 was a null pointer (Prime used octal, and the top 4 bits of the 16-bit word had other uses).  Segment 0 was a kernel segment, and just loading 0 into a segment register in user code was an access violation.  This would have been fine in properly written C (int* p = 0; stored bit pattern 7777/0 into p). However it turns out that a lot of C code assumes that if you memset a block of memory to all bits zero, that any contained pointers will have been set to NULL.  They eventually had to add a whole new instruction called TCNP (Test C Null Pointer). Another interesting example are Java processors, CPUs that execute (a subset of) Java Virtual Machine bytecode as their instruction sets. If you’re interested enough to ask this question, you might want to read one of the later editions of Andrew Tanenbaum’s textbook, Structured Computer Organization¹, in which he walks the reader step-by-step through the design of a simple Java processor. ¹ Apparently not the third edition or below.  It’s in Chapter 4 of the fifth edition. The MIPS RISC ISA often seems strange to newcomers: instructions like ADD generate exceptions on signed integer overflow. It is necessary to use ADDU, add unsigned, to get the usual 2’s complement wrap. Now, I wasn’t there at the time, but I conjecture that MIPS provided this behavior because it was designed with the Stanford benchmarks - which were originally written in the Pascal programming language, which requires overflow detection. The C programming language does not require overflow traps. The MIPSr6 new (circa 2012) ISA gets rid of the integer overflow trapping instructions - at least those with a 16 bit immediate - in order to free up opcode space. I was there when this was done. I can testify that programming languages influenced many modern x86 features, at least from P6 onwards. Mainly C/C++; to some extent JavaScript. Not yet retro (as of 2019), but on topic: the ARM Cortex-M design was influenced by the C language (may also apply to Cortex-A and -R, but I don't have experience with them). Originally there were only IMUL r/m16 and IMUL r/m8 that output a product twice as wide as the operands. However in reality modern high-level languages generally produce a multiplication result that has the same type as the two operands unless you cast the them to a wider type. For example in C if we have int a and int b then a*b will also have type int. Same to most other languages. Doing a non-widening multiplication is also faster than getting the full result, so Intel added the 2 and 3-operand forms that don't calculate the high bits There are two additional forms for the IMUL instruction which do not fit the above pattern. The first is a two-operand version that follows the pattern for ADD: This is a more traditional-looking two-operand instruction² that updates the destination register in place. There is even a (gasp) three-operand version similar to what you see in other processors. This three-operand version accepts an immediate as the third operand, and it's the one the compiler typically generates. For example, These additional forms produce only single-precision results, but that's what the C and C++ languages produce, so it fits well with those languages. If you need a double-precision result, then you can use the single-operand MUL and IMUL instructions. Note that there is no unsigned version of these additional forms. Fortunately, you can use the signed version for unsigned multiplication because the single-precision result is the same for both signed and unsigned multiplication. However, the flags are always set according to the signed result, so you cannot use them to detect unsigned overflow. In practice, this is not a problem because the C language doesn't give you access to the overflow flags anyway. Since they're more flexible, fit perfectly with the type model, and don't care about signness (because non-widening multiplication is the same for signed and unsigned values), compilers began to use it exclusively for almost all multiplications. As a result, Intel focused to optimize even more for those forms of imul. In fact nowadays single-operand mul and imul are very rarely used and may be slow on many μarchs.

who was involved in the atlantic charter and what was its purpose,"The Atlantic Charter was a pivotal policy statement issued during World War II on 14 August 1941, which defined the Allied goals for the post war world. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted the work and all the Allies of World War II later confirmed it. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war -- no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, self-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, which became the basis for the modern United Nations.","War leads to the erosion of liberty for the benefit of the military-industrial complex.  World War II set in motion the destruction of privacy and the formation of an Orwellian Police State controlled by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of America.  Under the guise of cooperation and mutual respect, countries signed secret agreements with the NSA to share signals intelligence (SIGINT) which in layman’s terms means your phone calls, instant messages, and more.  [1] Shortly after World War II, the United States and its allies built the ECHELON system to spy on land and satellite-based communications worldwide. [2] Their closest allies, dubbed The Five Eyes (FVEY), received privileged treatment from the NSA community wherein these five countries share resources on a grand scale. [3] The Five Eyes are also know as AUSCANNZUKUS, short for AUStralia, CANada, New Zealand, UK, and US.   As time progressed the Five Eyes added two more tiers to their club: the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes.  The Fourteen Eyes are officially known as SIGINT Seniors Europe, or “SSEUR” but I think we can unofficially call them: The New World Order. This Anglosphere-based NWO group is now hell-bent on a United Nations based one-world government, with a single digital currency worldwide, and a completely disarmed populace. [4] The recent Snowden-disclosures should be enough to wake the people, however informal gas station polls show that Average Joe has no clue. Each member of The Fourteen Eyes of the New World Order is subservient to the Five Eyes, and all other nations are enemies of the one-world government.  To see this any other way is to have eyes and yet be blind. The Fourteen Eyes use their combined technocratic might to infiltrate, subjugate, and excommunicate all who oppose their political or financial agendas.  The Five Eyes use their illuminated status to enslave the Nine side-kicks, as was the case during the Wikileaks disclosure of the US. government pushing Monsanto GMO corn into Paris, a Nine Eyes member.  The US. State department also used their NSA and 14 Eyes to spy on anti-GMO activists in Paris, and “calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits.” Occupy Wall Street suffered a similar fate. [5]  Through a combined lame-stream propaganda campaign and targeted domestic spying by the Department of Homeland Security, the will of the people was mocked, shunned, and silenced.  The Fourteen Eyes form a freedom-slaying Voltron that is worse than Orwell’s nightmares and what Willis was talkin’ about. The Fourteen Eyes feed a brain in Nevada at the Utah Data Center.  The NSA uses this massive database to silence activists, silence Congressmen, and even silence Generals. Still the question remains, who controls the NSA? How can any progress toward less government, less war, free energy, more freedom, and common abundance ever occur when globalist ideologies and Big Brother are hell-bent on destroying our borders, taking our guns, and ensuring nothing you do can stop our progress towards a one-world government.  The Fourteen Eyes will have their New World Order so don’t protest, buy the GMO corn, and go shopping, stay scared! Britain’s GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That’s how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles. The documents show that, in this situation, the services did what is not only obvious, but also anchored in German law: They exchanged information. And they worked together extensively. That applies to the British and the Americans, but also to the BND, which assists the NSA in its Internet surveillance. [53] According to previously unpublished material from a bail hearing, Delisle walked into the embassy wearing a red ball cap and civilian clothes. He flashed his Canadian military identification and asked to meet with someone from GRU, the Russian military intelligence. Delisle was posted to the security unit HMCS Trinity, an intelligence facility at the naval dockyard in Halifax. It tracks vessels entering and exiting Canadian waters via satellites, drones and underwater devices. While there he worked on a system called the Stone Ghost, said CBC reporter Rob Gordon. “It’s a computer system that links the five eyes. The five eyes are the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. All their information is shared on the Stone Ghost computer. “He would go to work every time with a thumb drive and download reams of information, which he would then send to the Russians on a monthly basis. This went on for years and years and years.” He was paid between $2,800 and $3,000 a month for the information. In 2009, when Delisle wanted to stop dealing with the Russians, they sent him a picture of his daughter walking to school in Halifax. [6][7] The National Security Agency routinely shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about US citizens, a top-secret document [8] provided to the Guardian by whistle-blower Edward Snowden reveals. Details of the intelligence-sharing agreement are laid out in a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart that shows the US government handed over intercepted communications likely to contain phone calls and emails of American citizens. The agreement places no legally binding limits on the use of the data by the Israelis. [9] Some foreign (and domestic —Ed.) observers regard any U.S. surveillance efforts with suspicion, fearing that intelligence products will be used against their national interests, the privacy rights of their citizens, or to advance the interests of U.S. firms in competition for international business. This view is held even though it is well-known that many countries have long undertaken similar efforts. Nonetheless, some argue that electronic surveillance, except in a narrow, court-approved, law enforcement context, should not be undertaken by democratic governments.

Moratoriums on Monsanto’s famous “MON 810” genetically modified (GMO) corn are being passed all across Europe due to people’s belief that these products are unsafe. Instead of respecting the people’s will, our state department considers making a “target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU” to help out their struggling buddies at Monsanto. 4. (C) France’s new “High Authority” on agricultural biotech is designed to roll back established science-based decision making. The recently formed authority is divided into two colleges, a scientific college and a second group including civil society and social scientists to assess the “common interest” of France. The authority’s first task is to review MON 810. In the meantime, however, the draft biotech law submitted to the National Assembly and the Senate for urgent consideration, could make any biotech planting impossible in practical terms. The law would make farmers and seed companies legally liable for pollen drift and sets the stage for inordinately large cropping distances. The publication of a registry identifying cultivation of GMOs at the parcel level may be the most significant measure given the propensity for activists to destroy GMO crops in the field. 5. (C) Both the GOF and the Commission have suggested that their respective actions should not alarm us since they are only cultivation rather than import bans. We see the cultivation ban as a first step, at least by anti-GMO advocates, who will move next to ban or further restrict imports. (The environment minister’s top aide told us that people have a right not to buy meat raised on biotech feed, even though she acknowledged there was no possible scientific basis for a feed based distinction.) Further, we should not be prepared to cede on cultivation because of our considerable planting seed business in Europe and because farmers, once they have had experience with biotech, become its staunchest supporters. 6. Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits. The list should be measured rather than vicious and must be sustainable over the long term, since we should not expect an early victory. [15] Let it be known: if you are an anti-GMO activist living in the United States of America or abroad, the full might of the Fourteen Eyes, the NSA, and the StoneGhost surveillance machine will bear down on you in defense of Monsanto.  How many more companies are on the “cool kids” list? “The common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality.”  Former CFR board member Walter Lippman, Public Opinion(1922) “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” “… once having joined the One-World Federated Government, no nation could secede or revolt … because with the Atom Bomb in its possession the Federal Government [of the World] would blow that nation off the face of the earth.” ” We must haul down the American flag … haul it down, stamp on it, spit on it. “ This organization was founded in Asheville, North Carolina as the result of a merger of five existing world government groups: American United for World Government; World Federalists, U.S.A.; Student Federalists; Georgia World Citizens Committee; and the Massachusetts Committee for World Federation. The United World Federalists is a non-partisan, non-profit organization with members in forty-eight states.

World War II was a total war; homeland production became even more invaluable to both the Allied and Axis powers. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree. All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences good and bad on the home front during World War I. Their success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. Among morale-boosting activities that also benefited combat efforts, the home front engaged in a variety of scrap drives for materials crucial to the war effort such as metal, rubber, and rags. The major powers devoted 50–61 percent of their total GDP to munitions production. The Allies produced about three times as much in munitions as the Axis powers. Source: Goldsmith data in Harrison (1988) p. 172 The Allies called themselves the ""United Nations"" (even before that organization formed in 1945), and pledged their support to the Atlantic Charter of 1941. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; free access to raw materials; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as the disarmament of aggressor nations. The sudden German invasion of neutral Belgium in May 1940 led in a matter of 18 days to the collapse of the Belgian army; King Leopold obtained an armistice that involved direct German military administration. The King refused the demand of the government that he flee with them to Britain; he remained as a puppet ruler under German control. The Belgian bureaucracy remained in place and generally cooperated with the German rulers. Two pro-German movements, the Flemish National Union comprising Flemish (Dutch-speaking ) separatists and the Walloon (French-speaking ) Rexists led by Léon Degrelle (1906–94)  supported the invaders and encouraged their young men to volunteer for the German army.[1] Small but active resistance movements, largely Communist, provided intelligence to the Allies. During the Holocaust in Belgium, the Nazis hunted down the 70,000 Jews living in Belgium, most of them refugees, and killed 29,000 of them.[2] The Germans expected to exploit Belgium's industrial resources to support their war machine. Their policies created severe shortages for the Belgian people, but shipped out far less than Germany had expected. They set up the ""Armaments Inspection Board"" in 1940 to relay munitions orders to factories; the Board came under the control of the German Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer in 1943, and had offices in industrial areas that were supposed to facilitate orders for materiél, and supervise production. However, factory production fell sharply after 1942. Although collaboration with the Nazis, especially among the Flemish, was evident in 1940, it soon faded in importance. Labor strikes and systematic sabotage slowed production, as did the emigration of workers to rural areas, Allied bombing, food shortages, and worker resentment to forced labor.[3] The Allies retook all of Belgium in September 1944 as the Germans retreated. They reappeared briefly during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, but were finally expelled in January 1945. The London‐based government‐in‐exile returned, but had to confront the resistance movements that demanded radical political change.[4] China suffered the second highest number of casualties of the entire war. Civilians in the occupied territories had to endure many large-scale massacres, including that in Nanking. In a few areas, Japanese forces also unleashed newly developed biological weapons on Chinese civilians leading to an estimated 200,000 dead.[5] Tens of thousands died when Nationalist troops broke the levees of the Yangtze to stop the Japanese advance after the loss of the Chinese capital, Nanjing. Millions more Chinese died because of famine during the war. Japan captured major coastal cities like Shanghai early in the war; cutting the rest of China off from its chief sources of finance and industry. Millions of Chinese moved to remote regions to avoid invasion. Cities like Kunming ballooned with new arrivals. Entire factories and universities were often taken along so the society could still function. Japan replied with hundreds of air raids on the new capital of Chongqing. Although China received much aid from the United States, China did not have sufficient infrastructure to properly arm or even feed its military forces, let alone its civilians. China was divided into three zones, with the Nationalists in the southwest and the Communists led by Mao Zedong (Mao) in control of much of the northwest. Coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese and civilians were treated harshly; young men were drafted into a puppet Chinese army. After the stunningly quick victory in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war and part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country.[6] The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them in prisoner of war camps inside Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. The Vichy French government, cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.[7][8] The two million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families.[9] Meanwhile, the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles.[10] After the war, France gave women the vote and additional legal and political rights, although nothing on the scale of the enfranchisement that followed World War I. Women suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods and the absence of the men in POW camps.[11] The rationing system was stringent and badly mismanaged, leading to pronounced malnourishment, black markets and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about 20% of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people.[12] French farm production fell by half because of the lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so, the Germans seized half the meat and 20% of the produce.[13] Supply problems quickly affected French stores, which lacked most items. The government responded by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting young people in urban areas. At shops, the queues lengthened. Some people—including German soldiers who could take advantage of arbitrary exchange rates that favored Germany—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without coupons at very high prices. Farmers diverted meat to the black market, which meant that there was much less for the open market. Counterfeit food coupons were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. Vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition were prevalent.[14] Advice about eating a healthier diet and home growing produce was distributed. Slogans like 'Digging for Victory' and 'Make Do and Mend' appeared on national posters and became a part of the war effort. The city environment made these efforts nearly negligible.[15] In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted survival. The official ration provided starvation-level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day (5400 kJ), supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.[16] The Dutch famine of 1944, known as the Hongerwinter (""Hunger winter"") was a man-made famine imposed by Germany in the occupied western provinces during the winter of 1944–1945. A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm areas. A total of 4.5 million people were affected, of whom 18,000 died, despite an elaborate system of emergency soup kitchens.[17] The Nazi Hunger Plan was to kill the Jews of Poland quickly, and slowly to force the Poles to leave by threat of starvation, so that they could be replaced by German settlers. The Nazis coerced Poles to work in Germany by providing favorable food rations for families who had members working in the Reich. The ethnic German population in Poland (Volksdeutsche) were given good rations and were allowed to shop for food in special stores. The German occupiers created a draconian system of food controls, including severe penalties for the omnipresent black market. There was a sharp increase in mortality due to the general malnutrition, and a decline in birth rates.[18][19][20][21] By mid 1941, the German minority in Poland received 2,613 calories (11,000 kJ) per day, while Poles received 699 and Jews in the ghetto 184.[22] The Jewish ration fulfilled just 7.5% of their daily needs; Polish rations only 26%. Only the ration allocated to Germans provided the full required calorie intake.[23] Additionally the Generalplan Ost of the Nazis, which envisioned the elimination of the Slavic population in the occupied territories and artificial famines-as proposed in the Hunger Plan, were to be used. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, conquering it in three weeks, as the Soviets invaded the eastern areas. During the German occupation, there were two distinct civilian uprisings in Warsaw, one in 1943, the other in 1944. The first took place in an entity, less than two square miles (5 km2) in area, which the Germans had carved out of the city and called Ghetto Warschau. The Germans built high walls around the ghetto, and crowded 550,000 Polish Jews into it, many from the Polish provinces. At first, people were allowed to enter and leave the ghetto, but soon its border became an ""iron curtain"". Unless on official business, Jews could not leave, and non-Jews, including Germans, could not enter. Entry points were guarded by German soldiers. Because of extreme conditions and hunger, mortality in the ghetto was high. In 1942, the Germans moved 400,000 ghetto residents to Treblinka where they were gassed on arrival. By April 19, 1943, when the Ghetto Uprising commenced, the population of the ghetto had dwindled to 60,000 individuals. In the following three weeks, virtually all died as the Germans fought and systematically destroyed the buildings in the ghetto.[25] The uprising by Poles began on August 1, 1944, when the Polish underground, the ""Home Army"", aware that the Soviet Army had reached the eastern bank of the Vistula, sought to liberate Warsaw much as the French resistance had liberated Paris a few weeks earlier. Joseph Stalin had his own group of Communist leaders for the new Poland and did not want the Home Army or its leaders (based in London) to control Warsaw. So he halted the Soviet offensive and gave the Germans free rein to suppress it. During the ensuing 63 days, 250,000 Poles of the Home Army surrendered to the Germans. After the Germans forced all the surviving population to leave the city, Hitler ordered that any buildings left standing be dynamited – 98 percent of the buildings in Warsaw were destroyed.[26] During the invasion of the Soviet Union in the early months of the war, rapid German advances almost captured the cities of Moscow and Leningrad. The bulk of Soviet industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain crops left standing in the fields  This caused hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1,523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Ural, and Siberia.[27] In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labor. The whole of the Soviet Union become dedicated to the war effort. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food.[28] Conditions were nevertheless severe. World War II was especially devastating to citizens of the USSR because it was fought on Soviet territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over a million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and old people. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Off-ration food was often so expensive that it could not add substantially to a citizen's food supply unless they were especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with any local resources they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold their surplus food at a high price; a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.[29] Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied to protect their Motherland against the evils of the German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of a Communist Party propaganda campaign to mobilize religious people. Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war, and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honors and money benefits if they had several children—mothers could earn around 1,300 rubles for having their fourth child and up to 5,000 rubles for their tenth.[30] The city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during World War II. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege, which lasted from September 1941 until January 1944. Many people lost weight, and grew weaker and more vulnerable to disease. If malnutrition persisted for long enough, its effects were irreversible. People's feelings of loyalty disappeared if they got hungry enough; they would steal from their closest family members in order to survive.[31] Only some of the citizens of Leningrad survived. Only 400,000 were evacuated before the siege began; this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. Subsequently, more managed to escape; especially when the nearby Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or ""road of life""—to safety.[32] Those in influential political or social positions used their connections to other elites to leave Leningrad both before and after the siege began. Some factory owners even looted state funds to secure transport out of the city during the first summer of the war.[33] The most risky means of escape, however, was to defect to the enemy and hope to avoid governmental punishment. Most survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck: for instance by securing factory employment, because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the requirements for survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers received larger rations than other civilians, and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced vital goods. Factories also served as mutual support centers, and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horsemeat in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.[34] Survival opportunities open to the wider Soviet community included barter and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with civilians who had extra warm clothes to exchange. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens could keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.[35] Many of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime to support themselves. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards; this could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes such as murder and cannibalism also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.[36] In the United States, farming and other production was increased. For example, citizens were encouraged to plant ""victory gardens"", personal farms that children sometimes worked on.[37] Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the ""home"" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the ""home front""; meanwhile the public sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of military action.[38] The Philippines was an American possession on the way to independence (scheduled in 1946) and controlled its own internal affairs. The Japanese invaded and quickly conquered the islands in early 1942. The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the Philippine Executive Commission. They initially organized a Council of State, through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic headed by President José P. Laurel proved to be ineffective and unpopular as Japan maintained very tight controls.[39] Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war. They formed an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon.[40] The Americans invaded in 1944–45; the battle for Manila was contested street by street with large numbers of civilians killed. As in most occupied countries, crime, looting, corruption, and black markets were endemic.[41] With a view of building up the economic base of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they try to grow cotton in on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flock to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs. The Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, derris for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and abaca (hemp) for rope. The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program was a failure that gave very little help to Japanese industry, and diverted resources needed for food production.[42] As Karnow reports, Filipinos ""rapidly learned as well that 'co-prosperity' meant servitude to Japan's economic requirements."" [43] Living conditions were bad throughout the Philippines during the war. Transportation between the islands was difficult because of lack of fuel. Food was in very short supply, with sporadic famines and epidemic diseases[44][45] The Japanese tried to remove all Western and American cultural influences. They met fierce resistance when they tried to undermine the Catholic Church by arresting 500 Christian missionaries. The Filipinos came to feel morally superior to the brutal Japanese and rejected their advances.[46] Newspapers and the media were tightly censored. The Japanese tried to reshape schools and impose the Japanese language. They formed neighborhood associations to inform on the opposition.[47] Britain's total mobilization during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a ""people's war"" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.[48][49] Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.[50] Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.[51] The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control.[52] In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals, and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasized, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labor force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.[53] Parents had much less time to supervise their children, and there were fears of juvenile delinquency, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all young people over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organizations available to them.[54] In mid-1940, the RAF (Royal Air Force) was called on to fight the Battle of Britain but it had suffered serious losses. It lost 458 aircraft—more than current production—in France and was hard pressed. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They were: Wellingtons, Whitley Vs, Blenheims, Hurricanes and Spitfires. These aircraft received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labor was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.[55] Starting in 1941, the US provided munitions through Lend lease that totaled $15.5 billion[56] Food, clothing, petrol, leather and other items were rationed. However, items such as sweets and fruits were not rationed, as they would spoil. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew ""victory gardens"", and small home vegetable gardens. Many things were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for nitroglycerin production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally-sourced unrationed products than people in cities, and were more able to grow their own. The rationing system, which had been originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government's imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal ""national loaf"". Surveys of public opinion showed that most Britons were pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.[58] From very early in the war, it was thought that the major industrial cities of Britain, especially London, would come under Luftwaffe air attack; this did happen with The Blitz. Some children were sent to Canada, the USA and Australia and millions of children and some mothers were evacuated from London and other major cities to safer parts of the country when the war began, under government plans for the evacuation of civilians, but they often filtered back. When the Blitz bombing began on September 6, 1940, they evacuated again. The discovery of the poor health and hygiene of evacuees was a shock to many Britons, and helped prepare the way for the Beveridge Report. Children were evacuated if their parents agreed; but in some cases they had no choice. The children were only allowed to take a few things with them, including a gas mask, books, money, clothes, ration book and some small toys.[59][60] Belfast in Northern Ireland was a representative British city that has been well studied by historians.[61][62] It was a key industrial city producing ships, tanks, aircraft, engineering works, arms, uniforms, parachutes and a host of other industrial goods. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.[63] As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city for example. The Northern Ireland government under Richard Dawson Bates (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was too distant. When Germany conquered France in spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After seeing the Blitz in London in the autumn of 1940, the government began the construction of air raid shelters. The Luftwaffe in early 1941, flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Especially hard hit were the working class areas in the north and east of the city where over a thousand were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city afraid of future attacks. The bombing revealed the terrible slum conditions. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. Apart from the numbers of dead, the Belfast blitz saw half of the city's houses destroyed. Approximately twenty million pounds worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticized heavily for its lack of preparation. The criticism forced the resignation of Northern Ireland's Prime Minister J. M. Andrews. The bombing raids continued until the invasion of Russia in the summer of 1941. The American army arrived in 1942–44, setting up bases around Northern Ireland, and spending freely. An Emergency Hospital Service was established at the beginning of the war, in the expectation that it would be required to deal with large numbers of casualties. A common theme called for an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices [64] The goal was operationalized in a famous report by William Beveridge  It recommended that the various income maintenance services that a grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.[65] The themes of equality and sacrifice were dominant during the war, and in the memory of the war. Harris points out that the war was seen at the time and by a generation of writers as a period of outstanding national unity and social solidarity. There was little antiwar sentiment during or after the war. Furthermore, Britain turned more toward the collective welfare state during the war, expanding it in the late 1940s and reaching a broad consensus supporting it across party lines. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, historians were exploring the subtle elements of continuing diversity and conflict in  society during the war period.[66] For example, at first historians emphasized that strikes became illegal in July 1940, and no trade union called one during the war. Later historians pointed to the many localized unofficial strikes, especially in coal mining, shipbuilding, the metal trades, and engineering, with as many as 3.7 million man days lost in 1944.[67] The BBC collected 47,000 wartime recollections and 15,000 images in 2003-6 and put them online.[68] The CD audiobook Home Front 1939–45 also contains a selection of period interviews and actuality recordings.[69] Canada joined the war effort on September 10, 1939; the government deliberately waited after Britain's decision to go to war, partly to demonstrate its independence from Britain and partly to give the country extra time to import arms from the United States as a non-belligerent.[70] War production was ramped up quickly, and was centrally managed through the Department of Munitions and Supply. Unemployment faded away. Canada became one of the largest trainers of pilots for the Allies through the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Many Canadian men joined the war effort, so with them overseas and industries pushing to increase production, women took up positions to aid in the war effort. The hiring of men in many positions in civilian employment was effectively banned later in the war through measures taken under the National Resources Mobilization Act.. Shipyards and repair facilities expanded dramatically as over a thousand warships and cargo vessels were built, along with thousands of auxiliary craft, small boats and others.[71] Canada expanded food production, but shipped so much to Britain that food rationing had to be imposed. In 1942 it shipped to Britain 25 per cent of total meat production (including 75% of the bacon), 65% of the cheese and 13% of the eggs.[72] Since 20% of Canada's population were not of British or French origin, their status was of special concern. The main goal was to integrate the marginalized European ethnicities—as opposed to the First World War policy of internment camps for Ukrainians and Germans. In the case of Germany, Italy and especially Japan, the government watched the ethnics closely for signs of loyalty to their homelands. The fears proved groundless.[73] In February 1942 21,000 Japanese Canadians were rounded up and sent to internment camps that closely resembled similar camps in the US because the two governments had agreed in 1941 to coordinate their evacuation policies.[74] Most had lived in British Columbia, but in 1945 they were released from detention and allowed to move anywhere in Canada except British Columbia, or they could go to Japan. Most went to the Toronto area.[75][76] Canadian women responded to urgent appeals to make-do, recycle and salvage in order to come up with needed supplies. They saved fats and grease; gathered recycled goods, handed out information on the best methods to use that one may get the most out of recycled goods and organized many other events to decrease the amount of waste. Volunteer organizations led by women also prepared packages for the military overseas or for prisoners of war in Axis countries. With World War II came the dire need for employees in the workplace, without women to step-in, the economy would have collapsed. By autumn 1944 the number of women working full-time in Canada's paid labor force was twice what it had been in 1939, and that figure of between 1,000,000 and 1,200,000 did not include part-time workers or women working on farms.""[77] Women had to take on this intensive labor and while they did this they still had to find time to make jam, clothes and other such acts of volunteering to aid the men overseas. The government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Australian and American armed forces. There were a few Japanese attacks, most notably on Darwin in February 1942, along with the widespread fear in 1942, that Australia would be invaded. Australia entered the war in 1939 and sent its forces to fight the Germans in the Middle East (where they were successful) and Singapore (where they were captured by the Japanese in 1942). By 1943, 37% of the Australian GDP was directed at the war effort. Total war expenditure came to £2,949 million between 1939 and 1945.[78] The Curtin Labor Government took over in October 1941, and energized the war effort, with rationing of scarce fuel, clothing and some food. When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the danger was at hand, and all women and children were evacuated from Darwin and northern Australia. The Commonwealth Government took control of all income taxation in 1942, which gave it extensive new powers and greatly reduced the states' financial autonomy.[79] Manufacturing grew rapidly, with the assembly of high performance guns and aircraft a specialty. The number of women working in factories rose from 171,000 to 286,000.[80] The arrival of tens of thousands of Americans was greeted with relief, as they could protect Australia where Britain could not. The US sent in $1.1 billion in Lend Lease, and Australia returned about the same total in services, food, rents and supplies to the Americans.[81] New Zealand, with a population of 1.7 million, including 99,000 Maori, was highly mobilized during the war. The Labour party was in power and promoted unionization and the welfare state. The armed forces peaked at 157,000 in September 1942; 135,000 served abroad, and 10,100 died. Agriculture expanded, sending record supplies of meat, butter and wool to Britain. When American forces arrived, they were fed as well. The nation spent £574 million on the wear, of which 43% came from taxes, 41% from loans and  16% from American Lend Lease. It was an era of prosperity as the national income soared from £158 million in 1937 to £292 million in 1944. Rationing and price controls kept inflation to only 14% during 1939–45.[82][83] Montgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women, especially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional female jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and reversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and many women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change in gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since the 1920s.[84][85] During World War II, India was a colony of Britain known as British Raj. Britain declared war on behalf of India without consulting with Indian leaders.[86] This resulted in resignation of Congress Ministries.[87] The British recruited some 2.5 million Indian volunteers, who played major roles as soldiers in the Middle East, North Africa, and Burma in the British Indian Army. India became the main base for British operations against Japan, and for American efforts to support China. In Bengal, with an elected Muslim local government under British supervision, the cutoff of rice imports from Burma led to severe food shortages, made worse by maladministration. Prices soared and millions starved because they could not buy food. In the Bengal famine of 1943, three million people died.[88] A small anti-British force of about 40,000 men (and a few women) formed in Southeast Asia, the Indian National Army (INA) under Subhas Chandra Bose. It was under Japanese army control and performed poorly in combat. Its members were captured Indian soldiers from British Indian Army who gained release from extreme conditions in POW camps by joining the Japanese-sponsored INA. It participated in Battle Of Kohima and Battle of Imphal. In postwar Indian politics, some Indians called them heroes. The Congress Party in 1942 demanded immediate independence, which Britain rejected. Congress then demanded the British immediately ""Quit India"" in August 1942, but the Raj responded by immediately jailing tens of thousands of national, state and regional leaders; knocking Congress out of the war. Meanwhile, the Muslim League supported the war effort and gained prestige and membership, as well as British support for its demands for a separate Muslim state (which became Pakistan in 1947). Hong Kong was a British colony captured by Japan on December 25, 1941, after 18 days of fierce fighting. The conquest was swift, but was followed by days of large-scale looting; over ten thousand Chinese women were raped or gang-raped by the Japanese soldiers.[89] The population halved, from 1.6 million in 1941 to 750,000 at war's end because of fleeing refugees; they returned in 1945.[90] The Japanese imprisoned the ruling British colonial elite and sought to win over the local merchant gentry by appointments to advisory councils and neighborhood watch groups. The policy worked well for Japan and produced extensive collaboration from both the elite and the middle class, with far less terror than in other Chinese cities. Hong Kong was transformed into a Japanese colony, with Japanese businesses replacing the British. However, the Japanese Empire had severe logistical difficulties and by 1943 the food supply for Hong Kong was problematic. The overlords became more brutal and corrupt, and the Chinese gentry became disenchanted. With the surrender of Japan the transition back to British rule was smooth, for on the mainland the Nationalist and Communists forces were preparing for a civil war and ignored Hong Kong. In the long run the occupation strengthened the pre-war social and economic order among the Chinese business community by eliminating some conflicts of interests and reducing the prestige and power of the British.[91] Germany had not fully mobilized in 1939, nor even in 1941. Not until 1943, under Albert Speer (the minister of armaments in the Reich), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production. Instead of using all available Germans, it brought in millions of foreign workers from conquered countries, treating them badly (and getting low productivity in return).[92] Germany's economy was simply too small for a longer all-out war. Hitler's strategy was to change this by a series of surprise blitzkriegs. This failed with defeats in Russia in 1941 and 1942, and against the economic power of the allies.[93] Instead of expanding the economies of the occupied nations, the Nazis seized the portable machinery and rail cars, requisitioned most of their industrial output, took large quantities of food (15% of French output), and forced the victims to pay for their military occupation.[94] The Nazis forced 15 million people to work in Germany (including POWs); many died from bad living conditions, mistreatment, malnutrition, and executions. At its peak, forced laborers comprised 20% of the German work force and were a vital part of the German economic exploitation of the conquered territories. They were especially concentrated in munitions and agriculture.[95] For example, 1.5 million French soldiers were kept in POW camps in Germany as hostages and forced workers and, in 1943, 600,000 French civilians were forced to move to Germany to work in war plants.[96] Although Germany had about double the population of Britain (80 million versus 40 million), it had to use far more labor to provide food and energy. Britain imported food and employed only a million people (5% of the labour force) on farms, while Germany used 11 million (27%). For Germany to build its twelve synthetic oil plants with a capacity of 3.3 million tons a year required 2.4 million tons of structural steel and 7.5 million man-days of labor. (Britain imported all its oil from Iraq, Persia and North America). To overcome this problem, Germany employed millions of forced laborers and POWs; by 1944, they had brought in more than five million civilian workers and nearly two million prisoners of war—a total of 7.13 million foreign workers. Rationing in Germany was introduced in 1939 immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities. Hitler was at first convinced that it would affect public support for the war if a strict rationing program was introduced. The Nazi popularity was in fact partially due to the fact that Germany under the Nazis was relatively prosperous, and Hitler did not want to lose popularity or faith. Hitler felt that food and other shortages had been a major factor in destroying civilian morale during World War I which led to defeatism and surrender. Despite the rationing, civilians had sufficient amounts of food and clothing; witness Howard K. Smith later wrote that ""[f]or a people engaged in a life-and-death war ... the German people for two years of war ate amazingly well."" The meat ration, for example, was 500g per week per person. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, however, this changed to 400g per week, then fell further. Estimating that the meat ration had dropped by up to 80% in five months of fighting in Russia, and citing many other changes in living conditions that suddenly occurred, Smith wrote that by the time he left Germany in late 1941, ""for the first time ... the German people are undernourished"".[97] The system gave extra rations for men involved in heavy industry, and extremely low starvation rations for Jews and Poles in the areas occupied by Germany, but not to the Poles inside Germany many of whom had been brought in to perform heavy labor in German war industries. The amounts available under rationing were sufficient to live from, but clearly did not permit luxuries. Whipped cream became unknown from 1939 until 1948, as well as chocolates, cakes with rich crèmes etc. Meat could not be eaten every day. Other items were not rationed, but simply became unavailable as they had to be imported from overseas: coffee in particular, which throughout was replaced by substitutes made from roasted grains. Vegetables and local fruit were not rationed; imported citrus fruits and bananas were unavailable. In more rural areas, farmers continued to bring their products to the markets, as large cities depended on long distance delivery. Many people kept rabbits for their meat when it became scarce in shops, and it was often a child's job to care for them each day. By the spring of 1945, food distribution and the ration system was increasingly in collapse due to insurmountable transportation disruption and the rapid advance of the Allied armies from west and east with consequent loss of food storage facilities. In Berlin, during the beginning of the Battle of Berlin, the authorities announced the allocation of a special supplementary food ration on April 20, 1945. It consisted of a pound of bacon or sausage, half a pound of rice, half a pound of peas or pulses, a pound of sugar, four ounces of coffee substitute, one ounce of real coffee, and a tin of vegetables or fruit. Additionally, the authorities announced that standard food ration allocations for the next fortnight could be claimed in advance.[99] The extra allocation of rations were dubbed by Berliners Himmelfahrtsrationen, Ascension-day rations, ""Because with these rations we shall now ascend to heaven""[100] Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown nurses, and absorbed one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killing of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.[101] Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male doctors and medics. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.[102] The conquest of Germany in 1945 freed 11 million foreigners, called ""displaced persons"" (DPs)- chiefly forced laborers and POWs. In addition to the POWs, the Germans seized 2.8 million Soviet workers to labor in factories in Germany. Returning them home was a high priority for the Allies. However, in the case of Russians and Ukrainians returning often meant suspicion or prison or even death. The UNRRA, Red Cross and military operations provided food, clothing, shelter and assistance in returning home. In all, 5.2 million were repatriated to the Soviet Union, 1.6 million to Poland, 1.5 million to France, and 900,000 to Italy, along with 300,000 to 400,000 each to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Belgium.[103] In 1944–45, over 2.5 million ethnic Germans fled from Eastern Europe in family groups, desperately hoping to reach Germany before being overtaken by the Russians.[104][105] Half a million died in the process, the survivors were herded into refugee camps in East and West Germany for years. Meanwhile, Moscow encouraged its troops to regard German women as targets for revenge. Russian Marshal Georgi Zhukov called on his troops to, ""Remember our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our wives and children tortured to death by Germans....We shall exact a brutal revenge for everything."" Upwards of two million women inside Germany were raped in 1945 in a tidal wave of looting, burning and vengeance.[106] The Japanese home front was elaborately organized, block by block, with full-scale food rationing and many controls over labor. The government used propaganda heavily and planned in minute detail regarding the mobilization of manpower, identification of critical choke points, food supplies, logistics, air raid shelters, and the evacuation of children and civilians from targeted cities. Food supplies were very tight before the heavy bombing began in fall 1944, then grew to a crisis. There was only a small increase of 1.4 million women entering the labor force between 1940 and 1944. The minister of welfare announced, ""In order to secure its labor force, the enemy is drafting women, but in Japan, out of consideration for the family system, we will not draft them.""[107] The weaknesses in the maximum utilization of womanpower was indicated by the presence of 600,000 domestic servants in wealthy families in 1944. The government wanted to raise the birthrate, even with 8.2 million men in the armed forces, of whom three million were killed. Government incentives helped to raise the marriage rate, but the number of births held steady at about 2.2 million per year, with a 10% decline in 1944–45, and another 15% decline in 1945–46. Strict rationing of milk led to smaller babies. There was little or no long-term impact on the overall demographic profile of Japan.[108] The government began making evacuation plans in late 1943, and started removing entire schools from industrial cities to the countryside, where they were safe from bombing and had better access to food supplies. In all 1.3 million children were moved—with their teachers but not their parents.[109] When the American bombing began in earnest in late 1944, 10 million people fled the cities to the safety of the countryside, including two-thirds of the residents of the largest cities and 87% of the children. Left behind were the munitions workers and government officials. By April 1945, 87% of the younger children had been moved to the countryside. Agricultural production in the home islands  held up well during the war until the bombing started. It fell from an index of 110 in 1942 to 84 in 1944 and only 65 in 1945. Worse, imports dried up.[112] The Japanese food rationing system was effective throughout the war, and there were no serious incidences of malnutrition. A government survey in Tokyo showed that in 1944 families depended on the black market for 9% of their rice, 38% of their fish, and 69% of their vegetables.[113] The Japanese domestic food supply depended, however, on imports, which were largely cut off by the American submarine and bombing campaigns. Likewise there was little deep sea fishing, so that the fish ration by 1941 was mostly squid harvested from coastal waters. The result was a growing food shortage, especially in the cities. There was some malnutrition but no reported starvation.[114]  Despite government rationing of food, some families were forced to spend more than their monthly income could offer on black market food purchases. They would rely on savings or exchange food for clothes or other possessions.[115] The American aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities took from 400,000 to 600,000 civilian lives, with 100,000+ in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The Battle of Okinawa resulted in 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths. In addition civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000. The total of Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war and were caused by starvation or severe malnutrition in garrisons cut off from supplies.[117] Health and living conditions worsened after the surrender in September 1945. Most of the housing stock in large cities was destroyed, just as refugees tried to return from the rural areas. Adding to the crisis there was an influx of 3.5 million returning soldiers and 3.1 million Japanese civilians forcibly repatriated from Imperial outposts in Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines; about 400,000 civilians were left behind and not heard of again. Meanwhile, 1.2 million Koreans, POWs and other non-Japanese left Japan. The government implemented pro-natalist policies, which led to an increase in the marriage rate, but birth rates remained steady until they declined by 10% in the stress of the last year of the war, and another 15% during the hardship of the postwar period.[118] The American bombing campaign of all major cities severely impacted the economy, as did the shortages of oil and raw materials that intensified when Japanese merchant shipping was mostly sunk by American submarines. When industrial production was available to the military, for example, 24 percent of Japan's finished steel in 1937 was allocated to the military, compared to 85 percent in 1945.[119] By the end of the war, output percent of the highest capacity was still 100 percent for steel, although only 75 percent for aluminum, 63 percent for machine tools, 42 percent for vacuum tubes, 54 percent cement, 32 percent cotton fabric, and 36 percent for wool.[120] Severe food shortages were common throughout the war zones, especially in Europe where Germany used starvation as a military weapon. Japan did not use it as a deliberate policy, but the breakdown of its transportation and distribution systems led to famine and starvation conditions among its soldiers on many Pacific islands.[121] Bose (1990) studies the three great Asian famines that took place during the war: Bengal in India, Honan in China, and Tonkin in Vietnam. In each famine at least two million people died. They all occurred in densely populated provinces where the subsistence foundations of agriculture was failing under the weight of demographic and market pressures. In each cases famine played a role in undermining the legitimacy of the state and the preexisting social structure.[122] A great deal of housing was destroyed or largely damaged during the war, especially in the Soviet Union,[123] Germany, and Japan. In Japan, about a third of the families were homeless at the end of the war.[124] In Germany, about 25% of the total housing stock was destroyed or heavily damaged; in the main cities the proportion was about 45%.[125] Elsewhere in Europe, 22% of the prewar housing in Poland was totally destroyed; 21% in Greece; 9% in Austria, 8% in the Netherlands; 8% in France, 7% in Britain, 5% Italy and 4% in Hungary.[126]",,,,,,,,
when can you call in a missing person,"A common misconception is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case; in instances where there is evidence of violence or of an unusual absence, law enforcement agencies often stress the importance of beginning an investigation promptly.","Private Investigator in Miami, FL. Surveillance Investigation Miami and Divorce Investigation. South Beach Investigator. Miami Investigator A missing person is a person who has disappeared and whose status as alive or dead cannot be confirmed as his or her location and fate are not known. Laws related to missing persons are often complex since, in many jurisdictions, relatives, and third parties may not deal with a person's assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal death certificate issued. The situation, uncertainties, and lack of closure or a funeral resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely painful with long lasting effects on family and friends.A person may go missing due to an accident, crime, death in a location where they cannot be found (such as at sea), or many other reasons, including voluntary disappearance. In some countries, missing persons' photographs are posted on bulletin boards, milk cartons, postcards, and websites, to publicize their description. People go missing for many reasons. Some individuals choose to disappear alone; most of these soon return. Reasons for non-identification may include: A common misconception is that a person must be missing for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case; in instances where there is evidence of violence or of an unusual absence, law enforcement agencies often stress the importance of beginning an investigation promptly. A number of organizations seek to connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing people or children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations, including the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), as well as national centers, including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in the US, Child Focus in Belgium, and The Smile of the Child in Greece. Missing person’s reports are a popular story component on crime and legal shows but in real life, the situation is much more dramatic. By the time a missing person’s report is filed, tensions are often running high and that can mean important details are missed. It doesn't help that TV and movies don't tell the whole story about how to file missing person’s reports. There are important things to consider that are often left out. And there are some details that just aren't true. Knowing the facts before a crisis can be critical when things go wrong. Find out the important facts you need to know if you ever file a missing person’s report. There is no waiting period. Many shows and movies have publicized the 24 or 48 hour waiting period to report missing people but that doesn't exist in real police offices. As soon as you know an adult or child is missing, report it to police. Anyone can be a missing person. It's not just limited to children. Adults can be reported as missing too. If you suspect that someone you love can't be located and may need medical, legal, or other help, it's time to file a missing person’s report. Bring the right information. Police need as complete a description as possible to locate a missing person. When filing a report bring one or more clear photographs, preferably from the shoulders up. Also have a clear description of height, weight, age, and any identifying marks such as tattoos or birthmarks. Know what they were last seen wearing and who they were seen with before they went missing. Give all the details. Police may do an expedited search depending on the factors involved. Very young children and people who are mentally or physically impaired or in need of medical attention are in more danger the longer they are missing. Those who were likely the victim of a crime or other foul play may also get particular attention from police. Once police have all the facts about a potential missing person they will be better equipped to respond appropriately. Know what to expect after they're found. Hopefully, the missing person will be found quickly and before any harm happens. If they turn up on their own, make sure to inform police to call off the search. If police find a missing adult whose actions were voluntary, they might not disclose where the person is unless the person gives permission. Filing a missing person report for an adult doesn't entitle you to know where they are, only that they are safe. Interview people to gather information, search public or court records to uncover clues, conduct surveillance, collect evidence to present in court or to a client, verify employment and income, check for civil judgments and criminal history, investigate computer crimes and information theft, Private detectives, and investigators offer many services for individuals, attorneys, and businesses. Private investigators use a variety of tools when researching the facts in a case. Much of their work is done with a computer, allowing them to obtain information such as telephone numbers, details about social networks, descriptions of online activities, and records of a person’s prior arrests. They make phone calls to verify facts and interview people when conducting a background investigation. Investigators may go undercover to observe people and to obtain information. Detectives also conduct surveillance when investigating a case. They may watch locations, such as a person’s home or office, often from a hidden position. Using cameras and binoculars, detectives gather information on people of interest. Detectives and investigators must be mindful of the law when conducting investigations. Because they lack police authority, their work must be done with the same authority as a private citizen. As a result, they must have a good understanding of federal, state, and local laws, such as privacy laws, and other legal issues affecting their work. Otherwise, evidence they collect may not be useable in court and they could face prosecution. Computer forensics investigators specialize in recovering, analyzing, and presenting information from computers to be used as evidence. Many focus on recovering deleted emails and documents. Legal investigators help prepare criminal defenses, verify facts in civil lawsuits, locate witnesses, and serve legal documents. They often work for lawyers and law firms. Corporate investigators conduct internal and external investigations for corporations. Internally, they may investigate drug use in the workplace or ensure that expense accounts are not abused. Externally, they may try to identify and stop criminal schemes, such as fraudulent billing by a supplier. Financial investigators may be hired to collect financial information on individuals and companies attempting to make large financial transactions. These investigators are often certified public accountants (CPAs) who work closely with investment bankers and other accountants. Investigators might search for assets to recover damages awarded by a court in fraud and theft cases. Missing person investigators are licensed private investigators or sworn law enforcement officers who use standard police methods and specialized training to search for and locate people who have disappeared. Investigators may confront a variety of cases, including runaway children, potential or actual victims of kidnapping or other violent crimes, and persons with mental disabilities who have become lost. Investigators use digital and physical surveillance techniques, specialized database software, and interpersonal skills to solve cases. Going missing is not a crime in any country, so police cannot make every missing person a priority. Private investigators aren’t cheap, but when it is about your feeling to you beloved ones it is worthwhile any cost. Any important information uncovered by a private investigator should be shared with police. If the immediate search is not successful, you may be tempted to try almost anything. Some parents turn to private detectives to aid in the search. Consider hiring a private detective or investigator only if you are convinced that he or she can do something better or different than what is being done by law enforcement. Be certain that you are not simply wasting money that could be spent more productively in another way. If you decide to use a private detective, the following tips can help: Always ask for and check references to find out if the investigator is legitimate. Be wary of people who say they can bring your missing person back immediately for a specific sum of money. If you run into this situation, report it to law enforcement. Make sure you are paying a reasonable rate. Insist that the investigator itemizes expenses. Make sure the investigator or detective has experience working with law enforcement. Law enforcement must be notified immediately of any leads you receive from a private investigator. Inform your assigned law enforcement investigator about your decision to hire a private investigator. In most instances, this individual will need to talk to law enforcement before becoming involved in the case. Be prepared to encounter a few people who are fanatical or obsessive in their behavior or in their desire to help. Keep in mind that some people may try to use your loss to gain attention for themselves. Protect yourself from people who might be delusional or who may prey on victims through scams or by offering false hopes and expectations. The key is to keep your focus and exercise caution.

Entrapment law in the United States does not require police officers to identify themselves as police in the case of a sting or other undercover work. The law is specifically concerned with enticing people to commit crimes they would not have considered in the normal course of events. While people accused of crimes have certain rights, law enforcement does not have an obligation to tell the truth. Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

Among them, some of my favourites: In ancient Rome, the architectural feature called a vomitorium was the entranceway through which crowds entered and exited a stadium, not a special room used for purging food during meals.[1] Vomiting was not a regular part of Roman dining customs.[2] It is true that mean life expectancy in the Middle Ages and earlier was low; however, many take this to mean that people usually died around the age of 30.[5] In fact, the low life expectancy is an average very strongly influenced by high infant mortality, and the life expectancy of people who lived to adulthood was much higher. A 21-year-old man in medieval England, for example, could by one estimate expect to live to the age of 64.[6] George Washington did not have wooden teeth. His dentures were made of gold, hippopotamus ivory, lead, and human and animal teeth (including horse and donkey teeth).[34] Some people believe that food items cooked with wine or liquor will be totally non-alcoholic, because alcohol’s low boiling point causes it to evaporate quickly when heated. However, a study found that some of the alcohol remains: 25% after 1 hour of baking or simmering, and 10% after 2 hours.[88][89] Meteorites are not necessarily hot when they reach the Earth. In fact, many meteorites are found with frost on them. As they enter the atmosphere, having been warmed only by the sun, meteors have a temperature below freezing. The intense heat produced during passage through the upper atmosphere at very high speed then melts a meteor’s outside layer, but molten material is blown off and the interior does not have time to warm appreciably. Most meteorites fall through the relatively cool lower atmosphere for as long as several minutes at subsonic velocity before reaching the ground, giving plenty of time for their exterior to cool off again.[170] When a spacecraft reenters the atmosphere, the heat of reentry is not (primarily) caused by friction, but by adiabatic compression of air in front of the spacecraft.[171][172] There is a legend that Marco Polo imported pasta from China[20] which originated with the Macaroni Journal, published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting the use of pasta in the United States.[21] Marco Polo describes a food similar to “lagana” in his Travels, but he uses a term with which he was already familiar. Durum wheat, and thus pasta as it is known today, was introduced by Arabs from Libya, during their conquest of Sicilyin the late 7th century, according to the newsletter of the National Macaroni Manufacturers Association,[22] thus predating Marco Polo’s travels to China by about six centuries. It is rarely necessary to wait 24 hours before filing a missing person’s report; in instances where there is evidence of violence or of an unusual absence, law enforcement agencies in the United States often stress the importance of beginning an investigation promptly.[77][78][79] The UK government Web site says explicitly in large type “You don’t have to wait 24 hours before contacting the police”[80]. Searing meat does not “seal in” moisture, and in fact may actually cause meat to lose moisture. Generally, the value in searing meat is that it creates a brown crust with a rich flavor via the Maillard reaction.[86][87] All different tastes can be detected on all parts of the tongue by taste buds,[261] with slightly increased sensitivities in different locations depending on the person, contrary to the popular belief that specific tastes only correspond to specific mapped sites on the tongue.[262] The original tongue map was based on a mistranslation of a 1901 German thesis[263] by Edwin Boring. In addition, there are not 4 but 5 primary tastes. In addition to bitter, sour, salty, and sweet, humans have taste receptors for umami, which is a savory or meaty taste.[264][265][266] Humans have more than the commonly cited five senses. Although definitions vary, the actual number ranges from 9 to more than 20. In addition to sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, which were the senses identified by Aristotle, humans can sense balance and acceleration (equilibrioception), pain (nociception), body and limb position (proprioception or kinesthetic sense), and relative temperature (thermoception).[267] Other senses sometimes identified are the sense of time, itching, pressure, hunger, thirst, fullness of the stomach, need to urinate, need to defecate, and blood carbon dioxide levels.[268][269] Toilet waste is never intentionally jettisoned from an aircraft. All waste is collected in tanks which are emptied on the ground by toilet waste vehicles.[431] Blue ice is caused by accidental leakage from the waste tank. Passenger trains, on the other hand, have historicallyflushed onto the tracks; however, modern trains usually have retention tanks on board. …it involves doodles, a bit of tracing paper or some cheese wrap and a lot of fun.

He’d be mad if I revealed too much about him, but I think it’s safe to say, he is a lover of maps! In the middle of our discussion, in a comment I almost missed, he said “that’s why you can’t drive from North America to South America.” Freeze Frame! Back up! “What” I said. As he re-iterated his point, I began to hash out some thoughts in my head (imagine that), and a statement I remember hearing in a movie…….”having driven all the way from Denver to Santiago, Chile”………. One thing led to another, and soon we were deep in an online session of Google Maps.

According to Wikepedia; The Darién Gap (Spanish: Región del Darién or Tapón del Darién) is a break in the Pan-American Highway consisting of a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest within Panama‘s Darién Province in Central America and the northern portion of Colombia‘s Chocó Department in South America.

It measures just over 160 km (99 mi) long and about 50 km (31 mi) wide. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental toll is steep. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North/Central America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway. The geography of the Darién Gap on the Colombian side is dominated primarily by the river delta of the Atrato River, which creates a flat marshland at least 80 km (50 mi) wide, half of this being swampland. The Serranía del Baudó occupy Colombia’s Pacific coast and extend into Panama. The Panamanian side, in sharp contrast, is a mountainous rainforest, with terrain reaching from 60 m (200 ft) in the valley floors to 1,845 m (6,053 ft) at the tallest peaks (Cerro Tacarcuna). The Pan-American Highway is a system of roads measuring about 48,000 km (30,000 mi) long that crosses through the entirety of North, Central, and South America, with the sole exception of the Darién Gap. On the South American side, the highway terminates at Turbo, Colombia. On the Panamanian side, the road terminus is the town of Yaviza at. This marks a straight-line separation of about 100 km (60 mi). In between is marshland and forest. Efforts have been made for decades to remedy this missing link in the Pan-American highway. Planning began in 1971 with the help of United States funding, but this was halted in 1974 after concerns raised by environmentalists. Another effort to build the road began in 1992, but by 1994 a United Nations agency reported that the road, and the subsequent development, would cause extensive environmental damage. There is evidence that the Darién Gap has prevented the spread of diseased cattle into Central and North America, which have not seen foot-and-mouth disease since 1954, and since at least the 1970s this has been a substantial factor in preventing a road link through the Darién Gap. The Embera-Wounaan and Kuna have also expressed concern that the road would bring about the potential erosion of their cultures. The gap has been crossed by adventurers on bicycle, motorbike, all-terrain vehicle, and foot, dealing with jungle, swamp, insects, and other hazards.

where and when was the tsunami that caused the most casualties,"According to the U.S. Geological Survey a total of 227,898 people died (see table below for details). Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000. However, another report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.","The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami (also known as the Boxing Day Tsunami and, by the scientific community, the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake[8] [9]) occurred at 07:58:53 local time (UTC+7) on 26 December, with an epicentre off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1–9.3, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate. A series of massive tsunami waves grew up to high once heading inland, after being created by the underwater seismic activity offshore. Communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean were devastated, and the tsunamis killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries, including Aceh (Indonesia), Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu (India) and Khao Lak (Thailand). Banda Aceh reported the largest number of deaths. The earthquake was the third-largest ever recorded, the largest in the 21st century and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between eight and ten minutes.[10] It caused the planet to vibrate as much as,[11] and also remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska.[12] Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra.[13] The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response, with donations totalling more than US$14 billion.[14] The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8. In February 2005, scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to 9.0.[15] Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has accepted these new numbers, the United States Geological Survey has, as of 2022, so far not changed its estimate of 9.1.[16] A 2006 study estimated a magnitude of 9.1–9.3; Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that 9.2 is representative of the earthquake's size.[17] The hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately off the western coast of northern Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of below mean sea level (initially reported as). The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of .[13] The earthquake (followed by the tsunami) was felt in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.[18] Splay faults, or secondary ""pop up faults"", caused long, narrow parts of the seafloor to pop up in seconds. This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves, destroying the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga.[19] Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea, and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores to Timor. The 2002 Sumatra earthquake is believed to have been a foreshock, preceding the main event by over two years.[20] Great earthquakes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, are associated with megathrust events in subduction zones. Their seismic moments can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods. Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. This quake, together with the Great Alaskan earthquake (1964) and the Great Chilean earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment. Since 1900, the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Valdivia earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Alaska earthquake in Prince William Sound (magnitude 9.2). The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka, Russia, on 4 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0) and Tōhoku, Japan (magnitude 9.1) in March 2011. Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas, the much greater distances to more populated coasts, and the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) such as Japan. Other huge megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1868 (Peru, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1827 (Colombia, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, Caribbean Plate and South American Plate) and 1700 (western North America, Juan de Fuca Plate and North American Plate). All of them are believed to be greater than magnitude 9, but no accurate measurements were available at the time. See main article: Plate tectonics. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent. An estimated of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about along the subduction zone where the Indian Plate slides (or subducts) under the overriding Burma Plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes:Seismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about long and wide, beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at about, beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds.After a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about, continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions). The Indian Plate is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate, which underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, and is moving north-east at an average of . The India Plate meets the Burma Plate (which is considered a portion of the great Eurasian Plate) at the Sunda Trench. At this point, the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting and the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the Earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the Eurasian Plate has created the Sunda Arc. As well as the sideways movement between the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the seafloor by several metres, displacing an estimated of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire length of the rupture (acting as a line source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the seafloor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated .[21] See also: List of earthquakes in Indonesia and List of earthquakes in 2004. Numerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed. The magnitude 8.7 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event.[22] The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.1) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter magnitude scale. Other aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.6 continued to shake the region daily for three or four months.[23] As well as continuing aftershocks, the energy released by the original earthquake continued to make its presence felt well after the event. A week after the earthquake, its reverberations could still be measured, providing valuable scientific data about the Earth's interior. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in the sub-antarctic Auckland Islands, an uninhabited region west of New Zealand, and Macquarie Island to Australia's north. This is unusual since earthquakes of magnitude eight or more occur only about once per year on average.[24] The U.S. Geological Survey sees no evidence of a causal relationship between these events.[25] The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have triggered activity in both Leuser Mountain[26] and Mount Talang,[27] volcanoes in Aceh along the same range of peaks, while the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake had sparked activity in Lake Toba, an ancient crater in Sumatra.[28] The energy released on the Earth's surface (ME, which is the seismic potential for damage) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1E+17J.[29] This energy is equivalent to over 1,500 times that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, but less than that of Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated.[30] The earthquake generated a seismic oscillation of the Earth's surface of up to, equivalent to the effect of the tidal forces caused by the Sun and Moon. The seismic waves of the earthquake were felt across the planet, as far away as the U.S. state of Oklahoma, where vertical movements of were recorded. By February 2005, the earthquake's effects were still detectable as a complex harmonic oscillation of the Earth's surface, which gradually diminished and merged with the incessant free oscillation of the Earth more than four months after the earthquake.[31] Because of its enormous energy release and shallow rupture depth, the earthquake generated remarkable seismic ground motions around the globe, particularly due to huge Rayleigh (surface) elastic waves that exceeded in vertical amplitude everywhere on Earth. The record section plot displays vertical displacements of the Earth's surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1 cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicentre in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude signal is that of the compressional (P) wave, which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the antipode; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200-minute mark. The aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances but is dwarfed by the mainshock. The shift of mass and the massive release of energy slightly altered the Earth's rotation. Weeks after the earthquake, theoretical models suggested the earthquake shortened the length of a day by 2.68 microseconds, due to a decrease in the oblateness of the Earth. [32] It also caused the Earth to minutely ""wobble"" on its axis by up to in the direction of 145° east longitude,[33] or perhaps by up to .[34] Because of tidal effects of the Moon, the length of a day increases at an average of 15 microseconds per year, so any rotational change due to the earthquake will be lost quickly. Similarly, the natural Chandler wobble of the Earth, which in some cases can be up to, will eventually offset the minor wobble produced by the earthquake. There was movement laterally and vertically along the fault line. Early speculation was that some of the smaller islands south-west of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate (the southern regions are on the Sunda Plate), might have moved south-west by up to, but more accurate data released more than a month after the earthquake found the movement to be about .[35] Since movement was vertical as well as lateral, some coastal areas may have been moved to below sea level. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands appear to have shifted south-west by around and to have sunk by .[36] In February 2005, the Royal Navy vessel surveyed the seabed around the earthquake zone, which varies in depth between . The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a considerable impact on the topography of the seabed. 1500m (4,900feet) thrust ridges created by previous geologic activity along the fault had collapsed, generating landslides several kilometres wide. One such landslide consisted of a single block of rock some high and long. The momentum of the water displaced by tectonic uplift had also dragged massive slabs of rock, each weighing millions of tonnes, as far as across the seabed. An oceanic trench several kilometres wide was exposed in the earthquake zone.[37] The TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites happened to pass over the tsunami as it was crossing the ocean.[38] These satellites carry radars that measure precisely the height of the water surface; anomalies in the order of were measured. Measurements from these satellites may prove invaluable for the understanding of the earthquake and tsunami.[39] Unlike data from tide gauges installed on shores, measurements obtained in the middle of the ocean can be used for computing the parameters of the source earthquake without having to compensate for the complex ways in which proximity to the coast changes the size and shape of a wave. The sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion.[40] The tsunami, like all others, behaved differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a low, broad hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels at high speed of ; in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometres per hour but, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. Scientists investigating the damage in Aceh found evidence that the wave reached a height of when coming ashore along large stretches of the coastline, rising to in some areas when travelling inland.[41] Radar satellites recorded the heights of tsunami waves in deep water: maximum height was at two hours after the earthquake, the first such observations ever made.[42] [43] According to Tad Murty, vice-president of the Tsunami Society, the total energy of the tsunami waves was equivalent to about 5MtonTNT, which is more than twice the total explosive energy used during all of World War II (including the two atomic bombs) but still a couple of orders of magnitude less than the energy released in the earthquake itself. In many places, the waves reached as far as inland.[44] Because the fault affected by the earthquake was in a nearly north–south orientation, the greatest strength of the tsunami waves was in an east–west direction. Bangladesh, which lies at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal, had few casualties despite being a low-lying country relatively near the epicentre. It also benefited from the fact that the earthquake proceeded more slowly in the northern rupture zone, greatly reducing the energy of the water displacements in that region. Coasts that have a landmass between them and the tsunami's location of origin are usually safe; however, tsunami waves can sometimes diffract around such landmasses. Thus, the state of Kerala was hit by the tsunami despite being on the western coast of India, and the western coast of Sri Lanka suffered substantial impacts. Distance alone was no guarantee of safety, as Somalia was hit harder than Bangladesh despite being much farther away. Because of the distances involved, the tsunami took anywhere from fifteen minutes to seven hours to reach the coastlines.[45] [46] The northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra were hit quickly, while Sri Lanka and the east coast of India were hit roughly 90 minutes to two hours later. Thailand was struck about two hours later despite being closer to the epicentre because the tsunami travelled more slowly in the shallow Andaman Sea off its western coast. The tsunami was noticed as far as Struisbaai in South Africa, about away, where a 1.5m (04.9feet) tide surged on shore about 16 hours after the earthquake. It took a relatively long time to reach Struisbaai at the southernmost point of Africa, probably because of the broad continental shelf off South Africa and because the tsunami would have followed the South African coast from east to west. The tsunami also reached Antarctica, where tidal gauges at Japan's Showa Base recorded oscillations of up to a metre (1m (03feet)), with disturbances lasting a couple of days.[47] Some of the tsunami's energy escaped into the Pacific Ocean, where it produced small but measurable tsunamis along the western coasts of North and South America, typically around .[48] At Manzanillo, Mexico, a crest-to-trough tsunami was measured. As well, the tsunami was large enough to be detected in Vancouver, which puzzled many scientists, as the tsunamis measured in some parts of South America were larger than those measured in some parts of the Indian Ocean. It has been theorized that the tsunamis were focused and directed at long ranges by the mid-ocean ridges which run along the margins of the continental plates.[49] Despite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise. There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean.[50] Tsunami detection is not easy because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it. Tsunamis are more frequent in the Pacific Ocean than in other oceans because of earthquakes in the ""Ring of Fire"". Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Not every earthquake produces large tsunamis: on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami. The first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is felt only weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea sometimes recedes temporarily from the coast, which was observed on the eastern earthquake rupture zone such as the coastlines of Aceh, Phuket island, and Khao Lak area in Thailand, Penang island of Malaysia, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. This rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as of exposed beach, with fatal results.[51] However, not all tsunamis cause this ""disappearing sea"" effect. In some cases, there are no warning signs at all: the sea will suddenly swell without retreating, surprising many people and giving them little time to flee. One of the few coastal areas to evacuate ahead of the tsunami was on the Indonesian island of Simeulue, close to the epicentre. Island folklore recounted an earthquake and tsunami in 1907, and the islanders fled to inland hills after the initial shaking and before the tsunami struck. These tales and oral folklore from previous generations may have helped the survival of the inhabitants.[52] On Maikhao Beach in north Phuket City, Thailand, a 10-year-old British tourist named Tilly Smith had studied tsunamis in geography at school and recognised the warning signs of the receding ocean and frothing bubbles. She and her parents warned others on the beach, which was evacuated safely.[53] John Chroston, a biology teacher from Scotland, also recognised the signs at Kamala Bay north of Phuket, taking a busload of vacationers and locals to safety on higher ground. Anthropologists had initially expected the aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands to be badly affected by the tsunami and even feared the already depopulated Onge tribe could have been wiped out.[54] Many of the aboriginal tribes evacuated and suffered fewer casualties, however.[55] [56] Oral traditions developed from previous earthquakes helped the aboriginal tribes escape the tsunami. For example, the folklore of the Onges talks of ""huge shaking of ground followed by high wall of water"". Almost all of the Onge people seemed to have survived the tsunami.[57] The tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake. Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties. The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area. Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulee Lheue. This was succeeded by the appearance of two large black-coloured steep waves which then travelled inland into the capital city as a large turbulent bore. Eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a ""black giant"", ""mountain"" and a ""wall of water"". Video footage revealed torrents of black water, surging by windows of a two-story residential area situated about inland. Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them.[58] The level of destruction was extreme on the northwestern areas of the city, immediately inland of the aquaculture ponds, and directly facing the Indian Ocean. The tsunami height was reduced from at Ulee Lheue to a further to the north-east. The inundation was observed to extend inland throughout the city. Within of the shoreline, houses, except for strongly-built reinforced concrete ones with brick walls, which seemed to have been partially damaged by the earthquake before the tsunami attack, were swept away or destroyed by the tsunami.[59] [60] The area toward the sea was wiped clean of nearly every structure, while closer to the river, dense construction in a commercial district showed the effects of severe flooding. The flow depth at the city was just at the level of the second floor, and there were large amounts of debris piled along the streets and in the ground-floor storefronts. In the seaside section of Ulee Lheue, the flow depths were over . Footage showed evidence of back-flowing of the Aceh River, carrying debris and people from destroyed villages at the coast and transporting them up to inland.[61] A group of small islands: Weh, Breueh, Nasi, Teunom, Bunta, Lumpat, and Batee lie just north of the capital city. The tsunami reached a run-up of on the western shorelines of Breueh Island and Nasi Island. Coastal villages were destroyed by the waves. On the island of Pulau Weh, strong surges were experienced in the port of Sabang, yet there was little damage with reported runup values of, most likely due to the island being sheltered from the direct attack by the islands to the south-west.[60] Lhoknga is a small coastal community about south-west of Banda Aceh, located on a flat coastal plain in between two rainforest-covered hills, overlooking a large bay and famous for its large swathe of white sandy beach and surfing activities. The locals reported 10 to 12 waves, with the second and third being the highest and most destructive. Interviews with the locals revealed that the sea temporarily receded and exposed coral reefs. In the distant horizon, gigantic black waves about high made explosion-like sounds as it broke and approached the shore. The first wave came rapidly landward from the south-west as a turbulent bore about high.The second and third waves were high at the coast and appeared like gigantic surfing waves but ""taller than the coconut trees and was like a mountain"".[62] The second wave was the largest; it came from the west-southwest within five minutes of the first wave. The tsunami stranded cargo ships, barges and destroyed a cement mining facility near the Lampuuk coast, where it reached the fourth level of the building.[4] [63] [64] Meulaboh, a remote coastal city, was among the hardest hit by the tsunami. The waves arrived after the sea receded about, followed by an advancing small tsunami. The second and third destructive waves arrived later, which exceeded the height of the coconut trees. The inundation distance is about . Other towns on Aceh's west coast hit by the disaster included Leupung, Lhokruet, Lamno, Patek, Calang, and Teunom. Affected or destroyed towns on the region's north and east coast were Pidie Regency, Samalanga, Panteraja, and Lhokseumawe. The high fatality rate in the area was mainly due to lack of preparation of the community towards a tsunami and limited knowledge and education among the population regarding the natural phenomenon. Helicopter surveys showed entire settlements virtually destroyed with destruction within miles inland, and only some mosques left standing.[65] The greatest run-up height of the tsunami was measured at a hill between Lhoknga and Leupung, on the western coast of the northern tip of Sumatra, near Banda Aceh, and reached .[4] [66] The island country of Sri Lanka, located about from Sumatra, was ravaged by the tsunami around 2 hours after the earthquake. The tsunami first struck the eastern coastline and subsequently refracted around the southern point of Sri Lanka (Dondra Head). The refracted tsunami waves then inundated the southwestern part of Sri Lanka after some of its energy was reflected from impact with the Maldives.[67] In Sri Lanka, the civilian casualties were second only to those in Indonesia, with approximately 35,000 killed. The eastern shores of Sri Lanka were the hardest hit since it faced the epicentre of the earthquake, while the southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe. The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists and fishing.[68] The degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls. Approximately 90,000 buildings and many wooden houses were destroyed.[68] The tsunami arrived on the island as a small brown-orange-colored flood. Moments later, the ocean floor was exposed as much as in places, which was followed by massive second and third waves. Amateur video recorded at the city of Galle showed a large deluge flooding the city, carrying debris and sweeping away people while in the coastal resort town of Beruwala, the tsunami appeared as a huge brown-orange colored bore which reached the first level of a hotel, causing destruction and taking people unaware. Other videos recorded showed that the tsunami appeared like a flood raging inland. The construction of seawalls and breakwaters reduced the power of waves at some locations. The largest run-up measured was at with inundation distance of in Yala.[69] In Hambantota, run-ups measured with the greatest inundation distance of . Run-up measurements along the Sri Lankan coasts are at .[69] [67] Waves measured on the east coast ranged from at Pottuvill to Batticaloa at in the north-east around Trincomalee and in the west coast from Moratuwa to Ambalangoda. A regular passenger train operating between Maradana and Matara was derailed and overturned by the tsunami and claimed at least 1,700 lives, the largest single rail disaster death toll in history.[70] Estimates based on the state of the shoreline and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami above sea level and higher than the top of the train. The tsunami travelled eastward through the Andaman Sea and hit the south-western coasts of Thailand, about 2 hours after the earthquake. Located about from the epicentre, at the time, the region was popular with tourists because of Christmas. Many of these tourists were caught off-guard by the tsunami, as they had no prior warning. The tsunami hit during high tide. Major locations damaged included the western shores of Phuket island, the resort town of Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province, the coastal provinces of Krabi, Satun, Ranong and Trang and small offshore islands like Ko Racha Yai, the Phi Phi islands, the Surin Islands and the Similan archipelago. Approximately 8,000 people were killed. Thailand experienced the second largest tsunami run-up. The tsunami heights recorded:[71] The province of Phang Nga was the most affected area in Thailand. The quiet resort town of Khao Lak is located on a stretch of golden sandy beach, famed for its hotels overlooking the Andaman Sea and hilly rainforests. A video, taken by a local restaurant manager from a hill adjacent to the beach, showed that the tsunami's arrival was preceded by a sudden retreat of the sea exposing the seafloor. Many tourists and locals can be seen trying to gather fish. Moments later, the tsunami arrives as a wall of foaming water that slams into the coast, washing away numerous people who had no time to escape. Another amateur video, captured by a German family at beach level, showed the tsunami appearing as a white horizontal line in the distant horizon, gradually becoming bigger (bore-like), engulfing a jet skier and lifting two police boats.[72] A maximum inundation of approximately was measured, the inundated depths were and there was evidence that the tsunami reached the third floor of a resort hotel. The tsunami in Khao Lak was bigger due to offshore coral reefs and shallow seafloor which caused the tsunami to pile-up. This was similar to eyewitness accounts of the tsunami at Banda Aceh. Khao Lak also experienced the largest tsunami run-up height outside of Sumatra.[73] . The highest-recorded tsunami run-up was measured at Ban Thung Dap, on the south-west tip of Ko Phra Thong Island and the second-highest at at Ban Nam Kim.[71] Moreover, the largest death toll occurred at Khao Lak, with about 5,000 people killed. In addition, the tsunami inflicted damage to the popular resort town of Ao Nang in Krabi Province. Video footage showed that the tsunami appeared as multiple white surfs violently lifting up yachts, boats and crashing onto beaches. Footage captured at Koh Lanta showed a wall of water swamping the beach, while another video taken at another location showed a large surfing wave like tsunami approaching the shore, lifting up a yacht and flooding the beach. At Koh Sriboya, the tsunami advanced inland as a turbulent medium bore, while at Koh Phayam, Ranong Province, the tsunami appeared as a wall of water. At Phuket Province, the island province's western beaches were struck by the tsunami. At Patong Beach, a popular tourist destination, the tsunami first arrived as a small flood, which swept away cars and surprised people. About 10 minutes later, the sea receded for a while before the tsunami arrived again as a large wall of water looming over the skyline and flooding the coast. Another video from Kamala Beach showed the tsunami flooding the ground floor of a restaurant sweeping away an elderly couple. On Karon Beach, Kamala Beach and Kata Beach, the tsunami came in like a surging flood inland carrying people and cars. On some locations, a coastal road was built which was higher than the shore, protecting a hotel which was behind it. On the east coast of Phuket Island, the tsunami height was about 2 m. In one river mouth, many boats were damaged. The tsunami moved counter-clockwise around Phuket Island, as was the case at Okushiri Island in the 1993 Hokkaido earthquake. According to interviews, the second wave was the largest.[73] The tsunami heights were and the inundated depth was about . The tsunami surprised many tourists at Koh Racha Yai, where it flooded the resorts. About 250 people perished directly in the tsunami. The Phi Phi Islands are a group of small islands that were affected by the tsunami. The north bay of Phi Phi Don Island opens to the north-west in the direction of the tsunami. The measured tsunami height on this beach was . According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunami came from the north and south. The ground level was about 2 m above sea level, where there were many cottages and hotels. The south bay opens to the south-east and faces in the opposite direction from the tsunami. Furthermore, Phi Phi Le Island shields the port of Phi Phi Don Island. The measured tsunami height was in the port.[73] Amateur camcorder footage taken by Israeli tourists showed the tsunami advancing inland suddenly as a small flood, gradually becoming more powerful and engulfing the whole beach and resort, with the tsunami carrying a yacht out to sea. Moreover, the tsunami was detected by scuba divers around offshore islands like the Similan Islands and the Surin Islands. The divers reported being caught in a violent, swirling current suddenly while underwater. Local camcorder footage showed the tsunami surging inland and flooding camping equipment at the Similan Islands while the tsunami caught tourists unaware at the Surin Islands, and dragging them out towards the sea. The tsunami reached the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along the southeastern coastline of the Indian mainland about 2 hours after the earthquake. At the same time, it arrived in the state of Kerala, on the southwestern coast. There were two to five tsunamis that coincided with the local high tide in some areas.[74] [75] [76] [77] Along the coast of Tamil Nadu, the Marina Beach in Chennai was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware. Amateur video recorded taken at a resort beach showed the tsunami arriving as a large wall of water as it approached the coast and flooding it as it advanced inland. Besides that, a black muddy tsunami ravaged the city of Karaikal, where 492 lives were lost. The city of Pondicherry, protected by seawalls was relatively unscathed. Local video recorded that before the arrival of the tsunami, people can be seen swarming the beach to check on stranded fish from the exposed beach. Furthermore, at the coastal town of Kanyakumari, the seabed was exposed briefly before a large wall of water can be seen on the horizon and subsequently flooding the town. Other footage showed the tsunami dramatically crashed into the Vivekananda Rock Memorial.[77] The worst affected area in Tamil Nadu was Nagapattinam district, with 6,051 fatalities caused by a tsunami, followed by Cuddalore district, with many villages destroyed.[77] Most of the people killed were members of the fishing community.[77] Velankanni a sea shore town with a Catholic Basilica and a popular pilgrimage destination was also one of the worst hit by this tsunami that struck at around 9.30 am on that Sunday, when pilgrims who were mostly from Kerala among others were inside the church attending the Malayalam Mass. The rising sea water did not enter the shrine, but the receding waters swept away hundreds of pilgrims who were on the beach.[78] The shrine's compound, nearby villages, hundreds of shops, homes and pilgrims were washed away into the sea. About 600 pilgrims died.[79] Rescue teams extricated more than 400 bodies from the sand and rocks in the vicinity and large number of unidentified bodies were buried in mass graves. The state of Kerala experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern densely populated districts, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, and Kollam, due to diffraction of the waves around Sri Lanka. The southernmost district of Thiruvananthapuram, however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the Arabian Sea and on the east by the Kerala backwaters. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a tsunami.[77] A video recorded by locals showed the tsunami flooding the beach and villages, causing despair amongst the villagers. Many villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh were destroyed. In the Krishna district, the tsunami created havoc in Manginapudi and on Machalipattanam Beach. The most affected was Prakasham District, recording 35 deaths, with maximum damage at Singraikonda.[77] Given the enormous power of the tsunami, the fishing industry suffered the greatest. Moreover, the cost of damage in the transport sector was reported in the tens of thousands.[77] The tsunami run-up was only in areas in the state of Tamil Nadu shielded by the island of Sri Lanka but was in coastal districts such as Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu directly across from Sumatra. On the western coast, the runup elevations were at Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu and each at Kollam and Ernakulam districts in Kerala. The time between the waves ranged from about 15 minutes to 90 minutes.[74] [76] [80] The tsunami varied in height from to based on survivors' accounts.[77] The tsunami travelled at its maximum inland at Karaikal, Puducherry.[77] The inundation distance varied between in most areas, except at river mouths, where it was more than . Areas with dense coconut groves or mangroves had much smaller inundation distances, and those with river mouths or backwaters saw larger inundation distances. Presence of seawalls at the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts reduced the impact of the waves. However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.[74] [76] [80] Due to close proximity to the earthquake, the tsunami took just minutes to devastate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Andaman Islands were moderately affected while the island of Little Andaman and the Nicobar Islands were severely affected by the tsunami. In South Andaman island, based on local eyewitnesses, there were three tsunami waves, with the third being the most destructive. Flooding occurred at the coast and low-lying areas inland, which were connected to open sea through creeks. Inundation was observed, along the east coast of South Andaman Island, restricted to Chidiyatapu, Burmanallah, Kodiaghat, Beadnabad, Corbyn's cove and Marina Park/Aberdeen Jetty areas. Along the west coast, the inundation was observed around Guptapara, Manjeri, Wandoor, Collinpur and Tirur regions. Several near-shore establishments and numerous infrastructures such as seawalls and a 20 MW diesel-generated power plant at Bamboo Flat were destroyed.[81] At Port Blair, the water receded before the first wave, and the third wave was the tallest and caused the most damage. Meanwhile, in the Little Andaman, tsunami waves impinged on the eastern shore about 25 to 30 minutes after the earthquake in a four-wave cycle of which the fourth tsunami was the most devastating with a wave height of about . The tsunami destroyed settlements at Hut Bay within a range of from the seashore. Run up level up to have been measured.[81] In Malacca, located on the island of Car Nicobar, there were three tsunami waves. The sea was observed to rise suddenly before the onset of the first wave. The first wave came 5 minutes after the earthquake, preceded by a recession of the sea up to .. The second and third waves came in 10 minutes intervals after the first wave. The third wave was the strongest, with a maximum tsunami wave height of . Waves nearly three stories high devastated the Indian Air Force base, located just south of Malacca. The maximum tsunami wave height of . Inundation limit was found to be up to inland. The impact of the waves was so severe that four oil tankers were thrown almost from the seashore near Malacca to the Air force colony main gate.[81] In Chuckchucha and Lapati, the tsunami arrived in a three-wave cycle with a maximum tsunami wave height of . In Campbell Bay of Great Nicobar Island, the tsunami waves hit the area three times with an inundation limit of . A rise in sea level was observed before the first wave came within 5 minutes of the earthquake. The second and third waves came in 10-minute intervals after the first. The second wave was the strongest. The tsunami waves wreaked havoc in the densely populated Jogindar Nagar area, situated south of Campbell Bay. According to local accounts, tsunami waves attacked the area three times. The first wave came five minutes after the mainshock (0629 hrs.) with a marginal drop in sea level. The second wave came 10 minutes after the first one with a maximum height of to 8 m (26 ft) and caused the major destruction. The third wave came within 15 minutes after the second with lower wave height. The maximum inundation limit due to tsunami water was about .[81] The worst affected island in the Andaman & Nicobar chain is Katchall Island, with 303 people confirmed dead and 4,354 missing out of a total population of 5,312.[82] [83] [84] The significant shielding of Port Blair and Campbell Bay by steep mountainous outcrops contributed to the relatively low wave heights at these locations, whereas the open terrain along the eastern coast at Malacca and Hut Bay contributed to the great height of the tsunami waves.[83] [85] The tsunami severely affected the Maldives at a distance of from the epicentre. Similar to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful. Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and bathymetry of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.The highest tsunami wave measured was at Vilufushi Island. The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at along the streets. Local footage recorded showed the tsunami flooding the streets up to knee level in town, while another video taken at the beach showed the tsunami slowly flooding and gradually surging inland. In Myanmar, the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western Andaman Sea coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of Taninthayi Division were protected by the Myeik Archipelago. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it was revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between . Eyewitnesses compared the tsunami with the ""rainy-season high tide""; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the ""rainy-season high tide"" level.[88] Interviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in Taninthayi Division or Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to which to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake were not more than along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes were slightly large off the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta caused a concentration in tsunami energy.[88] The tsunami travelled west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of Somalia. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the Horn of Africa, drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest-hit was a stretch of the Somalia coastline between Garacad (Mudug region) and Xaafuun (Bari region), which forms part of the Puntland province. Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula.[89] The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent. The waves arrived around noon local time.[89] Consequently, tsunami runup heights vary from to with inundation distances varying from to . The maximum runup height of almost was recorded in Bandarbeyla. An even higher runup point was measured on a cliff near the town of Eyl, solely on an eyewitness account. The highest death toll was in Hafun, with 19 dead and 160 people presumed missing out of its 5,000 inhabitants. This was the highest number of casualties in a single African town and the largest tsunami death toll in a single town to the west of the Indian subcontinent. In Xaafuun, small drawbacks were observed before the third and most powerful tsunami wave flooded the town.[89] The tsunami also reached Malaysia, mainly on the northern states such as Kedah, Perak and Penang and on offshore islands such as Langkawi island. Peninsular Malaysia was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of Sumatra, which lies just off the western coast.[90] Bangladesh escaped major damage and deaths because the water displaced by the strike-slip fault was relatively little on the northern section of the rupture zone, which ruptured slowly. In Yemen, the tsunami killed two people with a maximum runup of .[91] The tsunami was detected in the southern parts of east Africa, where rough seas were reported, specifically on the eastern and southern coasts that face the Indian Ocean. A few other African countries also recorded fatalities; one in Kenya, three in Seychelles, ten in Tanzania, and South Africa, where two were killed as a direct result of the tsunami—the furthest from the epicentre.[92] [93] Tidal surges also occurred along the Western Australian coast that lasted for several hours, resulting in boats losing their moorings and two people needing to be rescued.[94] See main article: Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a total of 227,898 people died.[1] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000.[95] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.[96] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000. In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, ""It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish"".[5] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand. The tsunami caused severe damage and deaths as far as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest recorded fatality directly attributed to the tsunami at Rooi-Els, close to Cape Town, from the epicentre. In total, eight people in South Africa died due to high sea levels and waves. Relief agencies reported that one third of the dead appeared to be children. This was a result of the high proportion of children in the populations of many of the affected regions and because children were the least able to resist being overcome by the surging waters. Oxfam went on to report that as many as four times more women than men were killed in some regions because they were waiting on the beach for the fishers to return and looking after their children in the houses.[97] States of emergency were declared in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Maldives. The United Nations estimated at the outset that the relief operation would be the costliest in human history. Then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that reconstruction would probably take between five and ten years. Governments and non-governmental organizations feared that the final death toll might double as a result of diseases, prompting a massive humanitarian response. In addition to a large number of local residents, up to 9,000 foreign tourists (mostly Europeans) enjoying the peak holiday travel season were among the dead or missing, especially people from the Nordic countries.[98] Sweden was the European country most severely affected both in absolute numbers, and by a wide margin when considered in relation to the country's population, with a death toll of 543. Germany was close behind with 539 identified victims. Beyond the heavy toll on human lives, the Indian Ocean earthquake has caused an enormous environmental impact that will affect the region for many years to come. It has been reported that severe damage has been inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity and groundwater. Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threaten the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact will take a long time and significant resources to assess.[117] According to specialists, the main effect is being caused by poisoning of the freshwater supplies and of the soil by saltwater infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. It has been reported that in the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and aquifers were invaded through porous rock. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water. The Colombo-based International Water Management Institute monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one-and-a-half years after the event.[118] The IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the World Health Organization as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.[119] Salted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover.[118] In addition to other forms of aid,[120] the Australian government sent ecological experts to help develop strategies for reef-monitoring and rehabilitation of marine environments and coral reefs in the Maldives, Seychelles and other areas. Scientists had developed significant ecological expertise from work with the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia's northeastern waters.[121] In response to the unprecedented situation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) worked with governments in the region to determine the severity of the ecological impact and how to address it.[122] UNEP established an emergency fund, set up a Task Force to respond to requests for assistance from countries affected by the tsunami, and was able to mobilize and distribute approximately US$9.3 million for environmental recovery and disaster risk reduction between 2004 and 2007. Funding came from other international agencies and from countries including Finland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.[123] [124] Evidence suggested that the presence of mangroves in coastal areas had provided some protection, when compared to areas that had been cleared for aquaculture or development. As a result, mangrove restoration become a focus of a number of projects, with varied success. Such approaches to ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction appear to be most successful when local communities are closely involved as stakeholders throughout the process, and when careful attention is paid to the physical conditions of chosen sites to ensure that mangroves can thrive there.[125] The level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While the overall impact on the national economies was minor, local economies were devastated. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.[126] Some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean.[127] The impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear.[128] [129] In Sri Lanka, artisanal fishery, in which the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicated that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions were destroyed by the wave surges.[130] While the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created a demand for fibreglass-reinforced plastic catamarans in the boatyards of Tamil Nadu. Given that over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.[131] Even though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted as a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.[132] Countries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure is undamaged. However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons. Even beach resorts in parts of Thailand which were untouched by the tsunami were hit by cancellations.[133] Both the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the Malacca Straits, which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to, and are now only in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years. Officials also hoped that piracy in the region would drop off, since the tsunami had killed pirates and destroyed their boats.[134] Due to multiple factors, there was a 71.6% drop in the number of piracy incidents between 2004 and 2005, from 60 to 17 incidents. Levels remained relatively low for some years. However, between 2013 and 2014, piracy incidents rose dramatically by 73.2% to exceed pre-tsunami levels.[135] See also: Library damage resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D. 1400.[136] [137] In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago. A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D. 1300 and 1450.[138] The 2004 earthquake and tsunami combined is the world's deadliest natural disaster since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. The earthquake was the third-most-powerful earthquake recorded since 1900. The deadliest-known earthquake in history occurred in 1556 in Shaanxi, China, with an estimated death toll of 830,000, though figures from this period may not be as reliable.[139] Before 2004, the tsunami created in both Indian and Pacific Ocean waters by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, thought to have resulted in anywhere from 36,000 to 120,000 deaths, had probably been the deadliest in the region. In 1782, about 40,000 people are thought to have been killed by a tsunami (or a cyclone) in the South China Sea.[140] The deadliest tsunami before 2004 was Italy's 1908 Messina earthquake on the Mediterranean Sea where the earthquake and tsunami killed about 123,000.[141] Many health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami.[142] Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs. The hardest-hit area, Aceh, is a religiously conservative Islamic society and has had no tourism nor any Western presence in recent years due to the insurgency between the Indonesian military and Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Some believe that the tsunami was divine punishment for lay Muslims shirking their daily prayers or following a materialistic lifestyle. Others have said that Allah was angry that Muslims were killing each other in an ongoing conflict.[143] Saudi cleric Muhammad Al-Munajjid attributed it to divine retribution against non-Muslim vacationers ""who used to sprawl all over the beaches and in pubs overflowing with wine"" during Christmas break.[144] The widespread devastation caused by the tsunami led GAM to declare a cease-fire on 28 December 2004 followed by the Indonesian government, and the two groups resumed long-stalled peace talks, which resulted in a peace agreement signed 15 August 2005. The agreement explicitly cites the tsunami as a justification.[145] In a poll conducted in 27 countries, 15% of respondents named the tsunami the most significant event of the year. Only the Iraq War was named by as many respondents.[146] [147] The extensive international media coverage of the tsunami, and the role of mass media and journalists in reconstruction, were discussed by editors of newspapers and broadcast media in tsunami-affected areas, in special video-conferences set up by the Asia Pacific Journalism Centre.[148] The tsunami left both the people and government of India in a state of heightened alert. On 30 December 2004, four days after the tsunami, Terra Research notified the India government that its sensors indicated there was a possibility of 7.9 to 8.1 magnitude tectonic shift in the next 12 hours between Sumatra and New Zealand.[149] In response, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs announced that a fresh onslaught of deadly tsunami was likely along the southern Indian coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, even as there was no sign of turbulence in the region.[149] The announcement generated panic in the Indian Ocean region and caused thousands to flee their homes, which resulted in jammed roads.[150] The announcement was a false alarm, and the Home Affairs minister withdrew their announcement.[150] On further investigation, the India government learned that the consulting company Terra Research was run from the home of a self-described earthquake forecaster who had no telephone listing and maintained a website where he sold copies of his detection system.[151] The tsunami had a severe humanitarian and political impact in Sweden. The hardest-hit country outside Asia, Sweden, lost 543 tourists, mainly in Thailand. The Persson Cabinet was heavily criticized for its inaction.[152] Smith Dharmasaroja, a meteorologist who had predicted that an earthquake and tsunami ""is going to occur for sure"" way back in 1994,[153] [154] was assigned the development of the Thai tsunami warning system. The Indian Ocean Tsunami warning system was formed in early 2005 to provide an early warning of tsunamis for inhabitants around the Indian Ocean coasts.[155] The changes in the distribution of masses inside the Earth due to the earthquake had several consequences. It displaced the North Pole by . It also slightly changed the shape of the Earth, specifically by decreasing Earth's oblateness by about one part in 10 billion, consequentially increasing Earth's rotation a little and thus shortening the length of the day by 2.68 microseconds.[156] See main article: Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. A great deal of humanitarian aid was needed because of widespread damage to the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage. Epidemics were of particular concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The main concern of humanitarian and government agencies was to provide sanitation facilities and fresh drinking water to contain the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and . There was also a great concern that the death toll could increase as disease and hunger spread. However, because of the initial quick response, this was minimized.[157] In the days following the tsunami, significant effort was spent in burying bodies hurriedly due to fear of disease spreading. However, the public health risks may have been exaggerated, and therefore this may not have been the best way to allocate resources. The World Food Programme provided food aid to more than 1.3 million people affected by the tsunami.[158] Nations all over the world provided over US$14 billion in aid for damaged regions,[159] with the governments of Australia pledging US$819.9 million (including a US$760.6 million aid package for Indonesia), Germany offering US$660 million, Japan offering US$500 million, Canada offering US$343 million, Norway and the Netherlands offering both US$183 million, the United States offering US$35 million initially (increased to US$350 million), and the World Bank offering US$250 million. Also, Italy offered US$95 million, increased later to US$113 million of which US$42 million was donated by the population using the SMS system[160] Four countries, Australia, India, Japan and the United States formed an ad-hoc corroborative group, and it was the origin of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.[161] According to USAID, the US has pledged additional funds in long-term U.S. support to help the tsunami victims rebuild their lives. On 9 February 2005, President Bush asked Congress to increase the U.S. commitment to a total of US$950 million. Officials estimated that billions of dollars would be needed. Bush also asked his father, former President George H. W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead a U.S. effort to provide private aid to the tsunami victims.[162] In mid-March, the Asian Development Bank reported that over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka reported that it had received no foreign government aid, while foreign individuals had been generous.[163] Many charities were given considerable donations from the public. For example, in the United Kingdom, the public donated roughly £330 million sterling (nearly US$600 million). This considerably outweighed the allocation by the government to disaster relief and reconstruction of £75 million and came to an average of about £5.50 (US$10) donated by every citizen.[164] [165] In August 2006, fifteen local aid staff working on post-tsunami rebuilding were found executed in north-east Sri Lanka after heavy fighting between government troops and the Tamil Tiger rebels, the main umbrella body for aid agencies in the country said.[166] This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

The earthquake triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing large numbers of people and inundating coastal communities across South and Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. The disaster has been variously named the Boxing Day Tsunami in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, because it took place on Boxing Day. The tsunami occurred exactly one year after the 2003 earthquake that devastated the southern Iranian city of Bam and exactly two years before the 2006 Hengchun earthquake. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and series of catastrophic tsunamis that followed in its wake, had a lesson to teach. The world community needs to put in place early detection systems, possibly sponsored by the United Nations, that would undoubtedly save lives. Although this earthquake happened close to large population centers that had little time to act even with warnings, nations farther away would have had time to issue life-saving warnings. Poorer nations are usually in the greatest need of early warning technology but the least able to pay for it. A United Nations sponsored initiative to put in place early warning systems for earthquakes, cyclones, typhoons, tornadoes, and tsunamis would take the world a great distance closer to creating a safe planet for all people, rich and poor. Initially, reports identified the earthquake as moment magnitude, Mw 9.0 (note that this is not the Richter scale or local magnitude scale, Ml, which is known to saturate at higher magnitudes). In February 2005 scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to Mw9.3.[2] The Hypocenter of the main earthquake sits at 3°18′58″N 95°51′14″E﻿ / ﻿3.316, 95.854, approximately 160 km (100 mi) west of Sumatra, at a depth of 30 km (19 mi) below mean sea level (initially reported as 10 km). People felt the earthquake itself (apart from the tsunami) as far away as Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, and the Maldives. Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to and including New Guinea and the Alpide belt along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores, and Timor. Great earthquakes such as the Sumatra-Andaman event, invariably associated with megathrust events in subduction zones, have seismic moments that can account for a significant fraction of the global earthquake moment across century-scale time periods. The Sumatra-Andaman earthquake measured the largest earthquake since 1964, and the second largest since the Kamchatka earthquake of October 16, 1737. Of all the seismic moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one-eighth arose as a result of the Sumatra-Andaman event. That quake, together with the Good Friday Earthquake (Alaska, 1964) and the Great Chilean Earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment. The much smaller but still catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake has been included in the diagram at right for perspective. Mw denotes the magnitude of an earthquake on the moment magnitude scale. Since 1900, the 1960 Great Chilean Earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake in Prince William Sound (9.2) constitute the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude. An earthquake off Kamchatka, Russia, on November 4, 1952, (magnitude 9.0 represents the only other recorded earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater). Each of those megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean, but the death toll from those measured significantly lower. The worst of those caused only a few thousand deaths, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater distances to more populated coasts. Other very large megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1868 (Peru, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1827 (Colombia, Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, Caribbean Plate and South American Plate) and 1700 (Cascadia Earthquake, western U.S. and Canada, Juan de Fuca Plate and North American Plate). Geologists calculate that those all had a magnitude 9, but no accurate measurements exist. The earthquake covered an unusually large area in geographical extent. An estimated 1,600 km (994 mi) of faultline slipped about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone where the India Plate slides under the Burma Plate. The slip took place in two phases over a period of several minutes. Seismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about 400 km (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, located 30 km (19 mi) beneath the sea bed—the longest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at a speed of about 2.8 km/s (1.7 mi/s) or 10,000 km/h (6,300 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over a period of about 100 seconds. A pause of about another 100 seconds took place before the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about 2.1 km/s (1.3 mi/s) or 7,600 km/h (4,700 mph), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates push past one another in opposite directions). That reduced the speed of the water displacement and so reducing the size of the tsunami that hit the northern part of the Indian Ocean.[3] The India Plate constitutes a part of the great Indo-Australian Plate, which underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, drifting north-east at an average of 6 cm/year (2 inches per year). The India Plate meets the Burma Plate (considered a portion of the great Eurasian Plate) at the Sunda Trench. At that point the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands and northern Sumatra. The India Plate slips deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. Those volatiles rise into the crust above and trigger melt which exits the earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian plate subducts the Eurasian plate has created the Sunda Arc. As well as the sideways movement between the plates, estimates put the rise of the sea bed at several metres, displacing an estimated 30 km³ (7 cu mi) of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. Rather than originating from a point source, as inaccurately depicted in some illustrations of their paths of travel, the waves radiated outwards along the entire 1,600 km (994 mi) length of the rupture (acting as a line source). That greatly increased the geographical area waves covered, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile and the Arctic. The raising of the sea bed significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated 0.1 mm.[4] Reports of numerous aftershocks off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre had been received in the hours and days that followed. The largest aftershock, originating off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, registered a magnitude of 8.7, prompting debate among seismologists as to whether to classify the event as an aftershock of the December 2004 quake or as a ""triggered earthquake"" (which typically differs from an aftershock in laying along a different fault line, often as large or larger than the earthquake which triggered it).[5] That earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as great as 6.1) and presently ranks as the seventh largest earthquake on record since 1900. Other aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.6 continued to shake the region daily for up to three or four months.[6] As well as continuing aftershocks, the energy released by the original earthquake continued to make its presence felt well after the event. A week after the earthquake, scientists still measured reverberations, providing valuable scientific data about the Earth's interior. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in an uninhabited region west of New Zealand's sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, and north of Australia's Macquarie Island. Geologists note that as unusual, since earthquakes of magnitude 8 or more occur only about once per year on average.[7] Some seismologists have speculated about a connection between those two earthquakes, saying that the former one might have been a catalyst to the Indian Ocean earthquake, as the two earthquakes happened on opposite sides of the Indo-Australian Plate. The U.S. Geological Survey sees no evidence of a causal relationship in this incident. Coincidentally, the earthquake struck almost exactly one year (to the hour) after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake killed an estimated 30,000 people in the city of Bam in Iran on December 26, 2003. Early estimated placed the total energy released by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake as high as 3.35 exajoules (3.35×1018 joules). That equals over 930 terawatt hours, 0.8 gigatons of TNT, or about as much energy used in the United States in 11 days. A new seismic energy release estimate, generated on September 30, 2005, using new data, placed the amount of energy released by the earthquake at the somewhat smaller figure of 1.1×1018 joules, equivalent to about 250 megatons of TNT. The earthquake generated seismic oscillation of the Earth's surface of up to 20–30 cm (8–12 in), equivalent to the effect of the tidal forces caused by the Sun and Moon. People felt the shock waves of the earthquake across the planet; as far away as the U.S. state of Oklahoma, where scientists recorded vertical movements of 3 mm (0.12 in). Because of its enormous energy release and shallow rupture depth, the earthquake generated remarkable seismic ground motions around the globe, particularly due to huge Rayleigh (surface) elastic waves that exceeded 1 cm in vertical amplitude everywhere on Earth. The record section plot below displays vertical displacements of the Earth's surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1 cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms have been arranged vertically by distance from the epicenter in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude, signal represents the compressional (P) wave, which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the antipode; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals represent seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200 minute mark. That aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances, but the mainshock dwarfed it. In February 2005, the British Royal Navy vessel HMS Scott surveyed the seabed around the earthquake zone, which varies in depth between 1,000 m and 5,000 m (3,300 ft and 16,500 ft). The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a huge impact on the topography of the seabed. 1,500-meter (5,000 ft) high thrust ridges created by previous geologic activity along the fault had collapsed, generating landslides several kilometers wide. One such landslide consisted of a single block of rock some 100 m high and 2 km long (300 ft by 1.25 mi). The momentum of the water displaced by tectonic uplift had also dragged massive slabs of rock, each weighing millions of tons, as far as 10 km (7 mi) across the seabed. An oceanic trench several kilometers wide appeared in the earthquake zone.[8] The sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several meters during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. Tsunamis which cause damage far away from its source is referred to as a ""teletsunami.""[9] Tsunamis behave very differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a small hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels at a very high speed of 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph); in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometers an hour but in doing so forms large destructive waves. Scientists investigating the damage in Aceh found evidence that the wave reached a height of 24 m (80 ft) when coming ashore along large stretches of the coastline, rising to 30 m (100 ft) in some areas when traveling inland. Radar satellites recorded the heights of tsunami waves in deep water: at two hours after the earthquake, the maximum height reached 60 cm (2 ft). Those represent the first such observations ever made although they lacked the capacity to provide a warning since the satellite data took hours to analyze.[10] According to Tad Murty, vice-president of the Tsunami Society, the total energy of the tsunami waves equaled about five megatons of TNT (20 petajoules). That amounts to more than twice the total explosive energy used during all of World War II (including the two atomic bombs), but still a couple of orders of magnitude less than the energy released in the earthquake itself. In many places the waves reached as far as 2 km (1.24 mi) inland. The 1,600 km (994 mi) of faultline affected by the earthquake lay in a nearly north-south orientation, the greatest strength of the tsunami waves moved in an east-west direction. Bangladesh, which lies at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal, had very few casualties despite being a low-lying country relatively near the epicentre, benefiting from the earthquake proceeded more slowly in the northern rupture zone. That greatly reducing the energy of the water displacements in the region. Coasts that have a landmass between them and the tsunami's location of origin usually escaped damage, although on occasion tsunami waves sometimes diffract around such landmasses. Thus, the tsunami hit the Indian state of Kerala despite sitting on the western coast of India, and the western coast of Sri Lanka also suffered substantial impacts. Also distance alone lacks a guarantee of safety; Somalia got hit harder than Bangladesh despite being much farther away. Because of the distances involved, the tsunami took anywhere from fifteen minutes to seven hours (for Somalia) to reach the various coastlines.[11] The northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra received waves very quickly, while Sri Lanka and the east coast of India suffered hits roughly 90 minutes to two hours later. Waves also Thailand struck about two hours later despite being closer to the epicenter, because the tsunami traveled more slowly in the shallow Andaman Sea off its western coast. Observers noticed the tsunami as far as Struisbaai in South Africa, some 8,500 km (5,300 mi) away, where a 1.5 m (5 ft) high tide surged on shore about 16 hours after the earthquake. It took a relatively long time to reach that spot at the southernmost point of Africa, probably because of the broad continental shelf off South Africa and because the tsunami would have followed the South African coast from east to west. The tsunami also reached Antarctica, where tidal gauges at Japan's Showa Base recorded oscillations of up to a meter, with disturbances lasting a couple of days.[12] Some of the tsunami's energy escaped into the Pacific Ocean, where it produced small but measurable tsunamis along the western coasts of North and South America, typically around 20 to 40 cm (7.9 to 15.7 in). At Manzanillo, Mexico, a tsunami measured 2.6 m (8.5 ft) crest-to-trough, large enough for detection in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. That puzzled many scientists, as the tsunamis in some parts of South America measured larger than those in some parts of the Indian Ocean. Some scientists theorized that the tsunamis focused, directed at long ranges by the mid-ocean ridges running along the margins of the continental plates. Despite a lag of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, the killer waves took nearly all of the victims completely by surprise. No tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean exist to detect tsunamis or to warn the general populace living around the ocean. Tsunami physics complicate detection; while a tsunami runs in deep water it has little height. Secondly, detection requires a network of sensors to detect it. Setting up the communications infrastructure to issue timely warnings constitutes an even bigger problem, particularly in a relatively poor part of the world. Tsunamis occur much more frequently in the Pacific Ocean because of earthquakes in the ""Ring of Fire,"" and an effective tsunami warning system has long been in place there. Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where this earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis have been relatively rare despite earthquakes frequently hitting Indonesia. The Krakatoa eruption of 1883 caused the last major tsunami. Large earthquakes only occasionally produce large tsunamis; on March 28, 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean without resulting in a major tsunami. In the aftermath of the disaster, awareness has increased for the need of a tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean. The United Nations started working on an Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System and by 2005 had the initial steps in place. Some have even proposed creating a unified global tsunami warning system, to include the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean. The earthquake itself serves as the first warning sign of a possible tsunami, although a tsunami can strike thousands of kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake with slight or negligible movement felt. In the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea often recedes temporarily from the coast, proving another warning sign. Around the Indian Ocean, that rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as 2.5 km (1.6 mi) of exposed beach, with fatal results.[13] People on the Indonesian island of Simeulue, very close to the epicenter, number among the few coastal areas to evacuate ahead of the tsunami. Island folklore recounted an earthquake and tsunami in 1907, and the islanders fled to inland hills after the initial shaking yet before the tsunami struck. The aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands was feared to have been badly affected by the tsunami. Many of the aboriginal tribes evacuated and suffered fewer casualties, however. Oral traditions developed from previous earthquakes helped the aboriginal tribes escape the tsunami. For example, the folklore of the Onge people talks of ""huge shaking of ground followed by high wall of water."" All 96 tribesmen of the semi-nomadic Onge survived by taking shelter in the highlands.[14] On Maikhao beach in northern Phuket, Thailand, a ten-year-old British tourist named Tilly Smith who had studied tsunamis in geography class at school, recognized the warning signs of the receding ocean and frothing bubbles. She and her parents warned others on the beach, leading to everyone evacuating safely.[15] John Chroston, a biology teacher from Scotland, also recognized the signs at Kamala Bay north of Phuket, taking a busload of vacationers and locals to safety on higher ground. The tsunami constituted a succession of several waves, occurring in retreat and rise cycles with a period of over thirty minutes between each peak. The third wave proved the most powerful and reached highest, occurring about an hour and a half after the first wave. Smaller tsunamis continued to occur for the rest of the day. Receding waters after the second tsunami, 10:20 A.M. 3rd tsunami wave, 11:00 A.M. 4th tsunami wave, 11:22 A.M. The U.S. Geological Survey initially recorded the toll as 283,100 killed, 14,100 missing, and 1,126,900 people displaced. Early news reports after the earthquake spoke of a toll in the hundreds, but the numbers rose steadily over the following week. More recent figures indicate that the actual casualties numbered 186,983 dead and 42,883 missing, for a total of 229,866, as more and more displaced survivors have been found and name duplications eliminated from the lists of victims. Measured in lives lost, the disaster makes the list of the top ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Relief agencies report that children appeared to total one-third of the dead, a result of the high proportion of children in the populations of many of the affected regions. Also children had the least ablity to resist being overcome by the surging waters. Oxfam went on to report that as many as four times more women than men died in some regions because they waited on the beach for the fishermen to return and they looked after their children in the houses.[16] In addition to the large number of local residents, up to 9,000 foreign tourists (mostly Europeans) enjoying the peak holiday travel season numbered among the dead or missing, especially people from the Nordic countries. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Maldives declared states of emergency. The United Nations estimated at the outset that the relief operation would become the costliest in human history. The earthquake and resulting tsunami affected many countries in Southeast Asia and beyond, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, the Maldives, Somalia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Seychelles and others. Many other countries, especially Australia and those in Europe, had large numbers of citizens traveling in the region on holiday. Both Sweden and Germany lost over 500 citizens each in the disaster. This earthquake measured the fourth most powerful earthquake recorded since 1900, and the confirmed death toll numbered just under 200,000 due to the ensuing tsunami. The deadliest earthquakes since 1900 include the Tangshan, China earthquake of 1976, with at least 255,000 killed; the earthquake of 1927 in Xining, Qinghai, China (200,000); the Great Kanto earthquake which struck Tokyo in 1923 (143,000); and the Gansu, China, earthquake of 1920 (200,000). The 2004 tsunami has been deemed the deadliest in recorded history. Prior to 2004, in 1782 the deadliest recorded tsunami in the Pacific Ocean with 40,000 people killed by a tsunami in the South China Sea. The tsunami created by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa resulted in an estimated 36,000 deaths. The most deadly tsunami between 1900 and 2004 occurred in 1908 in Messina, Italy, on the Mediterranean Sea, where the earthquake and tsunami killed 70,000. The most deadly tsunami in the Atlantic Ocean resulted from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which, combined with the toll from the actual earthquake and resulting fires, killed over 100,000. The 2004 earthquake and tsunami combined have been described as the deadliest natural disaster since either the 1976 Tangshan earthquake or the 1970 Bhola cyclone, or could conceivably exceed both of those. Because of uncertainty over death tolls, doubt may always exist over which of those natural disasters measured the deadliest. The human destruction of coral reefs played a significant role in the destruction caused by the tsunami. Many countries across Asia, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, have put forth efforts to destroy the coral surrounding their beaches, and instead make way for shrimp farms and other economic choices. On the Surin Island chain of Thailand's coast, many people survived as the tsunami rushed against the coral reefs protecting the islands. Many fewer people on lived on those islands, which also helps explain the lower death toll. Many reefs areas around the Indian Ocean have been exploded with dynamite because they impede shipping, an important part of the South Asian economy Similarly, the removal of coastal mangrove trees may have intensified the effect of the tsunami in some locations. Those trees, which had lined the coast before builders removed them to make way for coastal residences, might have blocked the force of the tsunami. The removal of coastal sand dunes constitutes another factor. Populations needed enormous humanitarian aid because of widespread damage of the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage. Epidemics posed a special concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. Humanitarian and government agencies concentrated on providing sanitation facilities and fresh drinking water to contain the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and B. Governments and humanitarian organizations, concerned that the death toll could rise further as diseases and hunger spread, took quick action, minimizing the loss.[17] In the days following the tsunami, people worked quickly to bury bodies for fear of disease. In retrospect the public health risks may have been exaggerated, leading to the speculation that resources may have been better allocated. The World Food Programme provided food aid to more than 1.3 million people affected by the tsunami. Nations all over the world provided over US$7 billion in aid for damaged regions, with the governments of Australia pledging US$819.9 million (including a US$760.6-million aid package for Indonesia), Germany offering US$660 million, Japan offering US$500 million, Canada offering US$343 million, Norway and The Netherlands offering both US$183 million, the United States offering US$35 million initially (increased to US$350 million), and the World Bank offering US$250 million. Also Italy offered US$ 95 million, increased later to US$ 113 million of which US$ 42 million where donated by the population using the SMS system[18] According to USAID, the US pledged additional funds in long-term U.S. support to help the tsunami victims rebuild their lives. On February 9, 2005, President Bush asked the U.S. Congress to increase the U.S. commitment to a total of $950 million. Officials estimated that billions of dollars would be needed. Bush also asked his father, former President George H. W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead a U.S. effort to provide private aid to the tsunami victims.[19] In mid-March the Asian Development Bank reported that over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments behind schedule. Sri Lanka reported that it had yet to receive foreign government aid, while foreign individuals had been generous.[20] The public donated generously to many charities. For example, in the UK the public donated roughly £330,000,000 sterling (nearly US$600,000,000). That considerably outweighed the donation by the government and came to an average of about £5.50 (US$10) donated by every citizen. In August 2006, the bodies of 15 local aid staff working on post-tsunami rebuilding executed in northeast Sri Lanka after heavy fighting had been found, the main umbrella body for aid agencies in the country said. Reports and rumors circulated that the local aid workers had been killed. The impact on coastal fishing communities and fisherfolk, some of the poorest people in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear.[21] In Sri Lanka artisanal fishery, fisherman commonly use fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears, an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery constitutes the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicated that 66 percent of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions were destroyed by the wave surges, with adverse economic effects both at local and national levels.[22] Countries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure remained undamaged. Tourists have been slow to return out of reluctance of spending vacation time in the scene of recent unimaginable destruction and loss of life. Even resorts on the Pacific coast of Thailand, completely untouched, experienced heavy cancellations. One year after the tsunami hit, tourism had begun to climb again.[23] Beyond the heavy toll on human lives, the Indian Ocean earthquake has caused an enormous environmental impact that will affect the region for many years to come. Reports of severe damage inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity and groundwater have been received by governments and media. In addition, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threaten the environment even further, in untold ways. According to specialists, poisoning of the freshwater supplies and the soil by saltwater infiltration and deposit of a salt layer over arable land has been the most serious damage. In the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls, overcome by sea waves, standing totally without fresh water, could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. In response to a request from the Maldivian Government, the Australian Government sent ecological experts to help restore marine environments and coral reefs—the lifeblood of Maldivian tourism. Much of the ecological expertise has been rendered from work with the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia's north-eastern waters. Sea, sand and earth invaded countless wells that served communities, invading aquifers through porous rock. Salted-over soil becomes sterile, rendering restoration for agriculture difficult and costly, causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms as well. The event destroyed thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka almost entirely. Many health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami. Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. The hardest hit area, Aceh, a religiously conservative Islamic society, has had no tourism nor any Western presence in recent years due to armed conflict between the Indonesian military and Acehnese separatists. Some believe that the tsunami represented divine punishment for lay Muslims shirking their daily prayers and/or following a materialistic lifestyle. Others have said that Allah felt angry that Muslims killed other Muslims in an ongoing conflict.[24] Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs. In what may be the most significant positive result of the tsunami, the widespread devastation led the main rebel group GAM to declare a cease-fire on December 28, 2004, followed by the Indonesian government, and the two groups resumed long-stalled peace talks, which resulted in a peace agreement signed August 15, 2005. The agreement explicitly cites the tsunami as a justification.[25] In another positive note of the tsunami, the water washed away centuries of sand from some of the ruins of a 1,200-year-old lost city at Mahabalipuram on the south coast of India. The site, containing such notable structures as a half-buried granite lion near a seventh century Mahablipuram temple and a relic depicting an elephant, belongs to what archaeologists deem an ancient port city swallowed by the sea hundreds of years ago.[26] All links retrieved October 16, 2020.

On Sunday, December 26, 2004, an undersea megathrust earthquake, known as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC in the Indian Ocean with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, between Simeulue in the Aceh province of Indonesia and mainland Indonesia. The earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3, is the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph. The duration of faulting, between 8.3 and 10 minutes, was the longest ever observed. The behemothic quake caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 centimetre (0.4 inches) and triggered other minor earthquakes as far away as Alaska. The tsunami was then known by various other names such as: “The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami,” “South Asian tsunami,” and “Indonesian tsunami.” Since the tsunami occurred on December 26, it was also known as the “Christmas tsunami” and the “Boxing Day tsunami.” The earthquake triggered a tsunami, considered to be one of the deadliest in history, which inundated coastal communities with waves up to 100 feet (30 meters) high and killed over 230,000 people in fourteen countries. It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The huge waves racing at the speed of a jet aircraft took fifteen minutes to seven hours to reach the various coastlines. The waves hit the northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra immediately. Thailand was struck about two hours later, despite being closer to the epicentre because the tsunami waves travelled more slowly in the shallow Andaman Sea off its western coast. About an hour and a half to two hours after the quake, Sri Lanka and the east coast of India were hit. The waves then reached the Maldives. Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. The earthquake and resulting tsunami in the Indian Ocean had a devastating effect on India. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs about 18,000 are estimated dead. The following table compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey shows that a total of 227,898 people died. According to this table, in mainland India and in its territories, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 12,405 people died in the tsunami, around 5,640 are missing and 647,599 people have been displaced. Figures compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey. . The Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean were devastated by the tsunami, and by the initial quake and several aftershocks that occurred during the following days. The Great Nicobar and Car Nicobar islands were the worst hit among all the islands due to their proximity to the epicentre of the quake and because of the relatively flat terrain. One-fifth of the population in Nicobar Islands was reported dead, missing or wounded. Chowra Island lost two-thirds of its population of 1,500. Communication was cut off when many islands submerged. The Trinket Island was bifurcated. Fishing communities were destroyed and very little is known about the effects of the tsunami on the indigenous tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar islands. The official death toll in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was 1,310, with about 5,600 missing from the islands. But the unofficial death toll, including those missing and presumed dead, was estimated to be around 7,000. The tsunami hit the southeastern regions of the Indian mainland. It inundated villages and devastated cities along the coast. Around 8,000 deaths were reported from Tamilnadu, and around 200 deaths from Kerala. The district of Nagapattinam was the worst hit in Tamil Nadu, with nearly 5,500 deaths. Surprisingly, Bangladesh, which lies at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal, had only two confirmed deaths, despite being a low-lying country and located relatively near the epicenter. Also, distance alone does not guarantee a safety since Somalia located in the Horn of Africa on the eastern coast was hit harder than Bangladesh even though it is much farther away. Coasts, with a landmass between them and the location of origin of a tsunami, are usually deemed safe, but tsunami waves can sometimes steer around such landmasses. Being a relatively small island, the western coast of Sri Lanka suffered substantial damages from the impact of the tsunami; likewise, the Indian state of Kerala too was hit by the tsunami, despite being on the western coast of India. The government of India announced a financial package of about US$200 million to Andaman and Nicobar islands after the tsunami, but the unbearable living conditions due to rise in sea level, constant aftershocks and fear of another similar tsunami, propelled thousands of settlers on the islands to relocate to the Indian mainland. According to the World Bank, reconstruction was expected to cost more than US$1.2 billion in India alone. . . . . Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

how did mcculloch v maryland expand the power of the federal government in relation to the states,"McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the Bank of the United States. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution.","17 U.S. 316 (1819); a landmark United States Supreme Court decision.  In this case, the state of Maryland attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable, the U.S. Bank was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law is generally recognized as specifically targeting the U.S. Bank. The Court invoked the Elastic Clause in the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers as long as those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers. 17 U.S. 316 McCulloch v. Maryland Congress has power to incorporate a bank. The Act of the 10th of April, 1816, ch. 44, to ""incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States"" is a law made in pursuance of the Constitution. The Government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action, and its laws, when made in pursuance of the Constitution, form the supreme law of the land. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States similar to the Articles of Confederation, which exclude incidental or implied powers. If the end be legitimate, and within the scope of the Constitution, all the means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may constitutionally be employed to carry it into effect. The power of establishing a corporation is not a distinct sovereign power or end of Government, but only the means of carrying into effect other powers which are sovereign. Whenever it becomes an appropriate means of exercising any of the powers given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union, it may be exercised by that Government. If a certain means to carry into effect of any of the powers expressly given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union be an appropriate measure, not prohibited by the Constitution, the degree of its necessity is a question of legislative discretion, not of judicial cognizance. The Bank of the United States has, constitutionally, a right to establish its branches or offices of discount and deposit within any state. The State within which such branch may be established cannot, without violating the Constitution, tax that branch. The State governments have no right to tax any of the constitutional means employed by the Government of the Union to execute its constitutional powers. The States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burthen, or in any manner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into effect the powers vested in the national Government. This principle does not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the Bank of the United States in common with the other real property in a particular state, nor to a tax imposed on the proprietary interest which the citizens of that State may hold in this institution, in common with other property of the same description throughout the State. This was an action of debt, brought by the defendant in error, John James, who sued as well for himself as for the State of Maryland, in the County Court of Baltimore County, in the said State, against the plaintiff in error, McCulloch, to recover certain penalties, under the act of the Legislature of Maryland hereafter mentioned. Judgment being rendered against the plaintiff in error, upon the following statement of facts agreed and submitted to the court by the parties, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland, the highest court of law of said State, and the cause was brought by writ of error to this Court. It is admitted by the parties in this cause, by their counsel, that there was passed, on the 10th day of April, 1816, by the Congress of the United States, an act entitled, ""an act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States;"" and that there was passed on the 11th day of February, 1818, by the General Assembly of Maryland, an act, entitled, ""an act to impose a tax on all banks, or branches thereof, in the State of Maryland, not chartered by the legislature,"" [p318] which said acts are made part of this Statement, and it is agreed, may be read from the statute books in which they are respectively printed. It is further admitted that the President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, incorporated by the act of Congress aforesaid, did organize themselves, and go into full operation, in the City of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, in pursuance of the said act, and that they did on the ___ day of _____ 1817, establish a branch of the said bank, or an office of discount and deposit, in the City of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, which has, from that time until the first day of May 1818, ever since transacted and carried on business as a bank, or office of discount and deposit, and as a branch of the said Bank of the United States, by issuing bank notes and discounting promissory notes, and performing other operations usual and customary for banks to do and perform, under the authority and by the direction of the said President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, established at Philadelphia as aforesaid. It is further admitted that the said President, directors and company of the said bank had no authority to establish the said branch, or office of discount and deposit, at the City of Baltimore, from the State of Maryland, otherwise than the said State having adopted the Constitution of the United States and composing one of the States of the Union. It is further admitted that James William McCulloch, the defendant below, being the cashier of the said branch, or office of discount and [p319] deposit did, on the several days set forth in the declaration in this cause, issue the said respective bank notes therein described, from the said branch or office, to a certain George Williams, in the City of Baltimore, in part payment of a promissory note of the said Williams, discounted by the said branch or office, which said respective bank notes were not, nor was either of them, so issued on stamped paper in the manner prescribed by the act of assembly aforesaid. It is further admitted that the said President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, and the said branch, or office of discount and deposit have not, nor has either of them, paid in advance, or otherwise, the sum of $15,000, to the Treasurer of the Western Shore, for the use of the State of Maryland, before the issuing of the said notes, or any of them, nor since those periods.

what is the central city of shiite islam,"The four holiest sites to Muslims are Mecca (Al-Haram Mosque), Medina (Al-Nabbawi Mosque), Jerusalem (Al-Aqsa Mosque), and Kufa (Kufa Mosque). In addition for Shias, the Imam Husayn Shrine, Al Abbas Mosque in Karbala, and Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf are also highly revered.","Al-Aqsa Mosque is an Islamic holy place in the Old City of Jerusalem. The site that includes the mosque (along with the Dome of the Rock), also referred to as al-Haram ash-Sharif or “Sacred Noble Sanctuary”, is the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, the place where the First and Second Temples are generally accepted to have stood. Muslims believe that Muhammad (PBUH) was transported from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to al-Aqsa during the Night Journey. Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad (PBUH) led prayers towards this site until the seventeenth month after the emigration, when Allah (SWT) directed him to turn towards the Ka’aba. Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin Mosque is a royal Islamic mosque located in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of the Sultanate of Brunei. The mosque is one of the most spectacular mosques in the Asia Pacific and a major landmark and tourist attraction of Brunei. Named after Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei, the mosque as a symbol of the Islamic faith in Brunei dominates the skyline of Bandar Seri Begawan. The building was completed in 1958 and is an impressive example of modern Islamic architecture. The mosque unites Mughal architecture and Italian styles. The plans were done by Booty and Edwards Chartered Architects according to designs by the Italian architect Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli, who had already for decades been working at the gulf of Siam. This state mosque is a masterpiece of architecture with its dove-grey walls and glittering majestic domes with gold inlay. It is centrally located at Jalan Tunku Abdul Raman and it is a proof of unique combination of Islamic architecture and contemporary design. Up to 5000 worshippers can be inside at one time; the mosque has become a popular place for visitors from all over the world. During prayer time, even Muslim women can visit the mosque as a special balcony is built that can fit 500 persons. If you are not a Muslim, avoid visiting the mosque on Fridays, as this is the day of prayer for Muslims. Never forget to respect the dress code when you are visiting a place of worship. Near the mosque is also Sabah’s State Mausoleum. The Hassan II Mosque is a religious buildings in Casablanca, Morocco, the largest mosque in the country and the fifth largest mosque in the world after the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) of Mecca and the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet’s Mosque) in Medina. It was designed by the French architect Michel Pinseau and built by Bouygues. It stands on a promontory looking out to the Atlantic, which can be seen through a gigantic glass floor with room for 25,000 worshippers. A further 80,000 can be accommodated in the mosque’s adjoining grounds for a total of 105,000 worshippers present at any given time at the Hassan II mosque. Its minaret is the world’s tallest at 210 m (689 ft). The Faisal Mosque in Islamabad is the largest mosque in Pakistan and South Asia and one of the largest mosques in the world. It was the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993, when it was overtaken in size by the completion of the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. Subsequent expansions of the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) of Mecca and the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet’s Mosque) in Medina, Saudi Arabia during the 1990s relegated Faisal Mosque to fourth place in terms of size. Faisal Mosque is conceived as the National Mosque of Pakistan. It has a covered area of 5,000 m2 (54,000 sq ft).[citation needed] It can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in its main prayer hall, 24,000 in its porticoes, 40,000 in its courtyard, and another 200,000 in its adjoining grounds. Although its covered main prayer hall is smaller than that of the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca (the world’s third largest mosque), Faisal Mosque has the third largest capacity of accommodating worshippers in its adjoining grounds after the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) of Mecca, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet’s Mosque) in Medina. Each of the Mosque’s four minarets are 80 m (260 ft) high (the tallest minarets in South Asia) and measure 10 x 10 m in circumference. The Badshahi Mosque or the ‘King’s Mosque’ in Lahore, commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671 and completed in 1673, is the second largest mosque in Pakistan and South Asia and the fifth largest mosque in the world. Epitomising the beauty, passion and grandeur of the Mughal era, it is Lahore’s most famous landmark and a major tourist attraction. Capable of accommodating 5,000 worshippers in its main prayer hall and a further 95,000 in its courtyard and porticoes, it remained the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986 (a period of 313 years), when overtaken in size by the completion of the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. Today, it remains the second largest mosque in Pakistan and South Asia and the fifth largest mosque in the world after the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) of Mecca, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet’s Mosque) in Medina, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca and the Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. Petra (“rock”) is an ancient city and archaeological site in Jordan carved in cliffs of multicolored rocks. It was built roughly 2,000 years ago by an ancient Arab people, the Nabateans, at a site that was a center for trade routes carrying silk from China and spices and precious stones from India to the West. It fell into disuse when the Romans captured the area and changed the trade route. Since then, earthquakes and erosion have changed the landscape, making it even more stunning. Today, Petra is a national symbol for Jordan and its most visited tourist attraction. Located merely eleven miles north of Beirut, the Jeita Grotto is a site to behold. The compound has two separate but connected limestone caves that span nearly ten kilometers in length, making it the longest cave complex in the Middle East. The lower cave can only be visited by boat, since it sits on an underground river that is a principal source of water for Lebanese citizens. The caves were formed through the dissolution of limestone over millions of years and were first discovered in 1836 by Reverend William Thompson. Exploration into the depths of the caves is still taking place. Today, Jeita Grotto serves as a national symbol and major tourist destination for Lebanon. The Giza Necropolis is located on the outskirts of Cairo and includes the Great Pyramids and the famous sculpture, the Sphinx. The only Ancient Wonder of the World that remains standing, these pyramids have long been considered one of the most precious sites in the world. The Great Pyramid, the largest of the three pyramids pictured, was built over 4,500 years ago and was the world’s tallest building for an astounding 3,000 years. It remains a building of architectural wonder given the complexity and precision found in its design. The pyramids were built as tombs for ancient rulers of Egypt, who were considered to be immortal in the eyes of their followers; today, they are one of Egypt’s main tourist attractions. The Dead Sea is one of the most captivating and unique bodies of water in the world. The sea is most known for its incredibly high salinity levels; the water here is one third salt, making it eight times saltier than ocean-water. The high level of salinity makes it nearly impossible for animals to live here, hence the name “Dead” Sea. It is also very difficult to swim in these waters. The Dead Sea is the deepest hypersaline lake in the world (378 meters deep) and has the lowest elevation on dry land on the Earth’s surface (422 meters below sea level). The body of water also has historical significance and has been utilized for its massive reserves of salt. Built in the sixth century, the Hagia Sophia has a long and storied history. Originally a church, the Hagia Sofia was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, whereupon the structure was renamed Ayasofya. Ayasofya’s towering dome has been used as a model for mosques for hundreds of years and is said to have changed modern architecture for its size and beauty. The interior of the building is filled with breath-taking pillars, mosaics and archways. Today, the building is a museum for members of all faiths to appreciate. Undisturbed by humans, Bu Tinah islands is a natural treasure lying off the coast of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The small archipelago is the region’s largest UNESCO marine biosphere reserve for its thriving ecosystem. The island is entirely closed off from humans and is patrolled to ensure that no one attempts to disrupt the habitat. The island is home to numerous endangered species and serves as a crucial research site for determining the effects of global warming. The island is also surrounded by an extensive coral reef, which survives the harsh temperatures and high salinity levels of the region. Located in the West African nation of Mali, Timbuktu once lay at the crossroads of four major trade routes that supplied the Arab world. Its geographic position made the city one of the wealthiest in the world during the 12th century. The city is home one of the first universities in the world, Koranic Sankore University, a celebrated Islamic university that taught over 20,000 students. Over time, Timbuktu developed into the intellectual and spiritual capital of Islam in Africa, and served as a focal point for regional expansion of the religion. While many of its buildings face the threat of desertification, Timbuktu remains an historically important location for intellectual scholarship in Islam. The Burj Al Arab is a luxury hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. At 321 m (1,053 ft), it is the second tallest hotel in the world. The Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280 m (920 ft) out from Jumeirah beach, and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. It is an iconic structure whose shape mimics the sail of a ship. The beachfront area where the Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach Hotel are located was previously called Chicago Beach. The hotel is located on an island of reclaimed land 280 meters offshore of the beach of the former Chicago Beach Hotel. The locale’s name had its origins in the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company which at one time welded giant floating oil storage tankers on the site.","What is said regarding the Sahw (Forgetting how many Raka a person has prayed). If someone gets up (for the third Rak’a without sitting) after the second Rak’a of a compulsory Salat. Narrated By 'Abdullah bin Buhaina  : Allah's Apostle once led us in a prayer and offered two Rakat and got up (for the third Raka) without sitting (after the second Raka). The people also got up with him, and when he was about to finish his prayer, we waited for him to finish the prayer with Taslim but he said Takbir before Taslim and performed two prostrations while sitting and then finished the prayer with Taslim. Narrated By 'Abdullah bin Buhaina  : Allah's Apostle got up after the second Raka of the Zuhr prayer without sitting in between (the second and the third Rakat). When he finished the prayer he performed two prostrations (of Sahu) and then finished the prayer with Taslim.

Allah's Apostle said, ""What is that?"" He said, ""You have offered five Rakat."" So Allah's Apostle performed two prostrations of Sahu after Taslim. If one finishes his Salat with Taslim after offering two or three Rak’a (by mistake), then he should perform two prostrations (of Sahw) like ordinary prostrations of the Salat, or longer. حَدَّثَنَا آدَمُ، حَدَّثَنَا شُعْبَةُ، عَنْ سَعْدِ بْنِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، عَنْ أَبِي سَلَمَةَ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ صَلَّى بِنَا النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم الظُّهْرَ أَوِ الْعَصْرَ فَسَلَّمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ ذُو الْيَدَيْنِ الصَّلاَةُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهَ أَنَقَصَتْ فَقَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم لأَصْحَابِهِ ‏""‏ أَحَقٌّ مَا يَقُولُ ‏""‏‏.‏ قَالُوا نَعَمْ‏.‏ فَصَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ أُخْرَيَيْنِ ثُمَّ سَجَدَ سَجْدَتَيْنِ‏.‏ قَالَ سَعْدٌ وَرَأَيْتُ عُرْوَةَ بْنَ الزُّبَيْرِ صَلَّى مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ رَكْعَتَيْنِ فَسَلَّمَ وَتَكَلَّمَ ثُمَّ صَلَّى مَا بَقِيَ وَسَجَدَ سَجْدَتَيْنِ وَقَالَ هَكَذَا فَعَلَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏ Narrated By Abu Huraira : The Prophet led us in the 'Asr or the Zuhr prayer and finished it with Taslim. Dhul-Yadain said to him, ""O Allah's Apostle! Has the prayer been reduced?"" The Prophet asked his companions in the affirmative. So Allah's Apostle I offered two more Rakat and then performed two prostrations (of Sahu). Sad said, ""I saw that 'Ursa bin Az-Zubair had offered two Rakat in the Maghrib prayer and finished it with Taslim. He then talked (and when he was informed about it) he completed the rest of his prayer and performed two prostrations, and said, 'The Prophet prayed like this.'""

He then stood near a price of wood in front of the Mosque and put his hand over it. Abu Bakr and 'Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who were in a hurry went out. They said, ""Has the prayer been reduced?"" A man who was called DhulYadain by the Prophet said (to the Prophet), ""Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?"" He said, ""Neither have I forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced."" He said, ""Certainly you have forgotten."" So the Prophet offered two more Rakat and performed Taslim and then said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer and then raised his head and said Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said Takbir. حَدَّثَنَا قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ، حَدَّثَنَا لَيْثٌ، عَنِ ابْنِ شِهَابٍ، عَنِ الأَعْرَجِ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ ابْنِ بُحَيْنَةَ الأَسْدِيِّ، حَلِيفِ بَنِي عَبْدِ الْمُطَّلِبِ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَامَ فِي صَلاَةِ الظُّهْرِ وَعَلَيْهِ جُلُوسٌ، فَلَمَّا أَتَمَّ صَلاَتَهُ سَجَدَ سَجْدَتَيْنِ فَكَبَّرَ فِي كُلِّ سَجْدَةٍ وَهُوَ جَالِسٌ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُسَلِّمَ، وَسَجَدَهُمَا النَّاسُ مَعَهُ مَكَانَ مَا نَسِيَ مِنَ الْجُلُوسِ‏.‏ تَابَعَهُ ابْنُ جُرَيْجٍ عَنِ ابْنِ شِهَابٍ فِي التَّكْبِيرِ‏ Narrated By 'Abdullah bin Buhaina Al-Asdi : (The ally of Bani 'Abdul Muttalib) Allah's Apostle stood up for the Zuhr prayer and he should have sat (after the second Raka but he stood up for the third Raka without sitting for Tashah-hud) and when he finished the prayer he performed two prostrations and said Takbir on each prostration while sitting, before ending (the prayer) with Taslim; and the people too performed the two prostrations with him instead of the sitting he forgot. When a person forgets whether he has offered three or four Rak’a (then he should) perform two prostrations while sitting in his last Rak’a. Narrated By Abu Huraira : Allah's Apostle said, ""When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama is pronounced, Satan again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he comes back again and tries to interfere with the person and his thoughts and say, ""Remember this and that (which he has not thought of before the prayer)"", till the praying person forgets how much he has prayed. If anyone of you does not remember whether he has offered three or four Rakat then he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting. Sahw (i.e. forgetfulness) in compulsory Salat and Nawafil. Narrated By Abu Huraira : Allah's Apostle said, ""When anyone of you stands for the prayers, Satan comes and puts him in doubts till he forgets how many Rakat he has prayed. So if this happens to anyone of you, he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting. If a person speaks to a person offering Salat, and the latter beckons with his hand and listens. حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ سُلَيْمَانَ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنِي ابْنُ وَهْبٍ، قَالَ أَخْبَرَنِي عَمْرٌو، عَنْ بُكَيْرٍ، عَنْ كُرَيْبٍ، أَنَّ ابْنَ عَبَّاسٍ، وَالْمِسْوَرَ بْنَ مَخْرَمَةَ، وَعَبْدَ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنَ أَزْهَرَ ـ رضى الله عنهم ـ أَرْسَلُوهُ إِلَى عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ فَقَالُوا اقْرَأْ عَلَيْهَا السَّلاَمَ مِنَّا جَمِيعًا وَسَلْهَا عَنِ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ بَعْدَ صَلاَةِ الْعَصْرِ وَقُلْ لَهَا إِنَّا أُخْبِرْنَا أَنَّكِ تُصَلِّينَهُمَا وَقَدْ بَلَغَنَا أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم نَهَى عَنْهَا‏.‏ وَقَالَ ابْنُ عَبَّاسٍ وَكُنْتُ أَضْرِبُ النَّاسَ مَعَ عُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ عَنْهُمَا‏.‏ فَقَالَ كُرَيْبٌ فَدَخَلْتُ عَلَى عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ فَبَلَّغْتُهَا مَا أَرْسَلُونِي‏.‏ فَقَالَتْ سَلْ أُمَّ سَلَمَةَ‏.‏ فَخَرَجْتُ إِلَيْهِمْ فَأَخْبَرْتُهُمْ بِقَوْلِهَا فَرَدُّونِي إِلَى أُمِّ سَلَمَةَ بِمِثْلِ مَا أَرْسَلُونِي بِهِ إِلَى عَائِشَةَ‏.‏ فَقَالَتْ أُمُّ سَلَمَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ سَمِعْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَنْهَى عَنْهَا ثُمَّ رَأَيْتُهُ يُصَلِّيهِمَا حِينَ صَلَّى الْعَصْرَ، ثُمَّ دَخَلَ عَلَىَّ وَعِنْدِي نِسْوَةٌ مِنْ بَنِي حَرَامٍ مِنَ الأَنْصَارِ فَأَرْسَلْتُ إِلَيْهِ الْجَارِيَةَ فَقُلْتُ قُومِي بِجَنْبِهِ قُولِي لَهُ تَقُولُ لَكَ أُمُّ سَلَمَةَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ سَمِعْتُكَ تَنْهَى عَنْ هَاتَيْنِ وَأَرَاكَ تُصَلِّيهِمَا‏.‏ فَإِنْ أَشَارَ بِيَدِهِ فَاسْتَأْخِرِي عَنْهُ‏.‏ فَفَعَلَتِ الْجَارِيَةُ فَأَشَارَ بِيَدِهِ فَاسْتَأْخَرَتْ عَنْهُ فَلَمَّا انْصَرَفَ قَالَ ‏""‏ يَا بِنْتَ أَبِي أُمَيَّةَ سَأَلْتِ عَنِ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ بَعْدَ الْعَصْرِ وَإِنَّهُ أَتَانِي نَاسٌ مِنْ عَبْدِ الْقَيْسِ فَشَغَلُونِي عَنِ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ اللَّتَيْنِ بَعْدَ الظُّهْرِ فَهُمَا هَاتَانِ ‏""‏‏ Narrated By Kuraib: I was sent to 'Aisha by Ibn Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar. They told me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two Rakat after the 'Asr prayer and to say to her, ""We were informed that you offer those two Rakat and we were told that the Prophet had forbidden offering them."" Ibn Abbas said, ""I along with 'Umar bin Al-Khattab used to beat the people whenever they offered them."" I went to 'Aisha and told her that message. 'Aisha said, ""Go and ask Um Salama about them."" So I returned and informed them about her statement. They then told me to go to Um-e-Salama with the same question with which she sent me to 'Aisha. Um-e-Salama replied, ""I heard the Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the 'Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, 'Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two Rakat after the 'Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them."" If he waves his hand then wait for him.' The slave girl did that. The Prophet beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, ""O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two Rakat after the 'Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of 'Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy and I could not offer the two Rakat after the Zuhr prayer. These (two Rakat that I have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones.

Allah's Apostle was delayed there, and the time of the prayer was due. Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said to him, ""Allah's Apostle has been delayed (there) and the time of prayer is due. So will you lead the people in prayer?"" Abu Bakr said, ""Yes if you wish."" Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the mean-time, Allah's Apostle came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and (saw) Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah's Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, ""O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, 'Subhan-Allah' for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?""

It was officially announced in a joint statement by Iran, Saudi Arabia and China.The statement was inked by Shakhani, Musaid Al Aiban, Saudi Arabia’s national security adviser, and Wang Yi, the director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party.Shamkhani has been involved in intensive talks with his Saudi counterpart in Beijing since Monday to find a final solution to the issues between Tehran and Riyadh. The negotiations followed a meeting between Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing last month.“As a result of the talks, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia agreed to resume diplomatic relations and re-open embassies and missions within two months,” the joint statement said.It added that the Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers will meet to “implement this decision and make the necessary arrangements for the exchange of ambassadors.”According to the statement, Iran and Saudi Arabia highlighted the need to respect each others’ national sovereignty and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of one another. They agreed to implement a security cooperation agreement signed in April 2001 and another accord reached in May 1998 to boost economic, commercial, investment, technical, scientific, cultural, sports and youth affairs cooperation.Iran, Saudi Arabia and China expressed their firm determination to make their utmost efforts to promote regional and international peace and security, it emphasized.The statement further explained that delegations from Iran and Saudi Arabia, led by Shamkhani and Aiban, held several meetings over the past five days following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s support for the expansion of ties between Tehran and Riyadh based on the principle of good neighborliness and his efforts to host meetings between Iranian and Saudi senior officials.The talks between Shamkhani and Aiban were also held as a result of the keenness of Tehran and Riyadh to resolve differences through dialogue and diplomacy based on fraternal ties and both sides’ adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Charter and international rules and principles, it added.Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Iran in January 2016 after Iranian protesters, enraged by the execution of prominent Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr by the Saudi government, stormed its embassy in Tehran.The two sides had held five rounds of negotiations in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad since April 2021.In their joint statement, Iran and Saudi Arabia also thanked Iraq and Oman for hosting the talks between the two sides in 2021 and 2022 as well as the leaders and government of the People’s Republic of China for hosting and supporting the talks held in that country.Source: PressTVSource: https://iqna.ir/en/news/      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 13:59 - January 25, 2023TEHRAN (IQNA) – Egypt denounced desecration of the Holy Quran in the Netherlands, warning that the action fuels hate speech.The Egyptian foreign ministry strongly condemned the tearing of a part of a copy of the Quran by a leader of an extremist movement in the Netherlands.In a statement carried by Ahram Online on Tuesday, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, “The disgraceful incident goes beyond freedom of expression, violates Muslim sanctities, and fuels hate speech between religions and peoples in a way that threatens communal security and stability.”On Monday, Dutch politician Edwin Wagensveld, the head of the far-right PEGIDA, tore pages out of the holy book before setting them on fire in front of the parliamentary building in the Hague.A video posted on his social media accounts showed Wagensveld claiming he received permission from local authorities for “the destruction of the Quran.”His provocation followed another Islamophobic protest on Saturday in Sweden, where a Danish extremist burned a copy of the holy book in a police-approved demonstration.The Muslim community worldwide has been outraged since the weekend at anti-Islam activist Rasmus Paludan, who staged his provocative demonstration in front of the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm while delivering a hate-filled speech, and the Swedish authorities who allowed him under the guise of “freedom of expression.”Source: wam.aeSource: https://iqna.ir/en/news/      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 20:07 - January 25, 2023TEHRAN (IQNA) – Egypt’s Al-Azhar Islamic Center called for boycotting Swedish and Dutch products in response to the desecration of the Quran in the European states.In a statement on Wednesday, Al-Azhar called on the Arab and Muslim peoples “to boycott all Dutch and Swedish products and to take a strong and unified stance in support of our Noble Quran, the sacred scripture of the Muslims, and as a proper reaction to the governments of these two countries, who have offended 1.5 billion Muslims.”On Sunday, Edwin Wagensveld, a far-right Dutch politician, and leader of the Islamophobic group Pegida, tore out pages from the Quran in The Hague, the administrative capital of the Netherlands. Wagensveld's video on Twitter showed that he burned the torn-out pages of the holy book in a pan.The new provocation followed a similar Islamophobic protest on Saturday in Sweden, where a Danish extremist burned a copy of the Quran, in a police-approved protest.“They have gone to excess in guarding the mean and barbaric crimes perpetrated under the specious inhumane and immoral banner or their so-called ‘freedom of expression’,” it added.The Sunni religious institution called on all Arabs and Muslims “to adhere to the boycott, and to educate children, youth and women about it.”“These deviants will never appreciate the value of the religion – about which they know nothing – or be deterred unless they face the challenging material, monetary and economic necessities. That is the only language they know,” the statement said.The desecration of the Quran has triggered a storm of condemnations from across the Islamic world, including Turkey.

A separate post on his Instagram account showed a letter, signed by Mayor of The Hague Jan van Zanen allowing him to use ""objects"" in his protest, but prohibiting him from burning it due to public safety.""The right to protest and the right to freedom of expression are constitutionally and treaty-protected human rights and freedoms,"" the letter said.But it added that ""in principle burning objects is not permitted, because this can cause danger.""As Wagensveld tore a page out of the holy book and scrunched it up, he said:""Soon, there will be registrations for similar actions in several cities, time to answer disrespect from Islam with disrespect.""He then continued to tear apart the Quran, throwing pages to the floor before saying: ""After having a nice bite to eat and a drink with our group, it was then time to burn the Quran's remains.""The video clip then shows the Quran and its torn-out pages burning in a fire in an object resembling a frying pan placed on a floor.""People who know and follow us know that we never give up, we do not let ourselves be intimidated by violence and death threats,"" he said.The destruction of a copy of Quran comes just days after another burning incident in Sweden on Saturday, which ignited condemnation and protests around the Muslim world.The anti-Muslim leader Rasmus Paludan had burned the Quran in front of the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm after receiving permission from the Swedish government.Detained several timesTwo months ago, Wagensveld had been detained by the police for insulting the Prophet Muhammad using a megaphone, according to local news and a written statement made by the Dutch Prosecutor's Office.The prosecutor's office decided, based on the existing case, that the statement made by Wagensveld could be considered as an insult to the religion of Islam.But it was ultimately decided that he had not committed any crime and therefore he would not be prosecuted for the act.Wagensveld was also detained a month prior for failing to comply with demonstration rules and warnings in accordance with a planned event to burn a copy of Quran.The PEGIDA movement had planned to burn the Quran opposite the temporary Dutch Parliament building but the event was cancelled, according to a statement from the city of The Hague, which said the demonstrators wanted to use the Quran in a ""provocative"" way.""It was decided that the demonstration could only be held without the Quran in order to prevent chaos. The demonstrators refused, after which the show was cancelled,” the statement said.The PEGIDA movement, in its social media account, argued that Wagensveld was detained on the grounds that he refused to give the Quran to the police.A counter-demonstration had also gathered in the region but dispersed after the police announced that the PEGIDA demonstration was cancelled.

When God wants to introduce the month of Ramadan, He says: “The month of Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed” [2:185]. God does not say this is the month when we fast.When a car stops working, we should put it on a downward slope so as to move; Ramadan is the path of modifying our attention to the Quran. Ramadan is a great opportunity to compensate for our lack of attention to the Holy Book. We should consider contemplating the Quran as a wajib (compulsory) act because the Quran blames those who do not do so: “Will they not then contemplate on the Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts!” [47:24]. This blaming refers to the obligatory nature of contemplation because God does not chastise individuals for doing Mustahabb acts such as Friday ghusl or night prayers. God chastises individuals two times here; He first says “Will they not then contemplate on the Quran?” before saying: “Or are there locks upon their hearts!”. A Mustahabb and peripheral act does not receive two consecutive reprimands! So it is an obligation to contemplate the Quran.Meanwhile, the month of Ramadan has special importance because of increased attention to the Quran. The Arabic word “tadabbor” is used in the Quran for thinking deeply about the Book’s concepts and does not have any other application other than in Quranic studies. The exact meaning of the word is understanding the wise arrangement that is present in the Quran.Source: https://iqna.ir/en/news/3478333/why-is-ramadan-important  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It also found that right-wing pundits were on many occasions ""left unchallenged when making generalisations against Muslims, including promoting falsehoods"".Rizwana Hamid, CFMM's director, said: “This latest report does not seek to place blame on any newspaper or broadcaster, nor on any individual journalist or reporter... However, it is time for the industry to admit that, on occasion and too often when it comes to Muslims and Islam, it gets things wrong.""The report's author, Faisal Hanif, said: “While neither Muslims nor Islam should be immune from criticism or inquiry, where warranted, we do expect this to be done fairly and with due care, without resorting to well-worn tropes and generalisations.”Two British newspaper editors, Emma Tucker of the Sunday Times and Alison Philips of The Mirror, welcomed the report. Tucker said this welcome came ""in the full knowledge that it contains criticisms of the press, my own paper included"".Philips said the report ""shows how much we as journalists must question ourselves and the work we are producing in relation to reporting of Muslims and Islam"".Almost one in ten online articles analysed misrepresented Muslims and/or Islam, with the majority of misrepresentation (82 percent) coming from news reporting.The report found that when it came to associating Muslims with negative behaviour and activity - something present in 60 percent of articles analysed - the news agencies Reuters, Associated Press (AP) and AFP were the top offenders.Those wire services were found to have almost exclusively bookended reporting on the harsh living conditions faced by Palestinians in Gaza with descriptions of the area being ruled by the ""Islamist militant"" group Hamas.Most articles did not mention the Egyptian and Israeli blockades of the coastal enclave, described by the Norwegian Refugee Council as ""the world's largest open-air prison"".The CFMM report describes wire agencies as ""incubators of negative aspect and behaviours"" connecting, often entirely unnecessarily, Muslims and Islam to terrorism, violent political events and strife in the Middle East.

AhlulBayt News Agency (ABNA): A Sunni scholar says there is a need to adopt international laws on banning divisive measures among followers of different Islamic Madhhabs.“Today we see in the West that racism has been banned internationally and individuals who violate the norms are being punished. However, we still have adopted no measure at the level of OIC or Arab Union or other scholarly councils that exist in many Islamic and Arab countries for announcing any action that could provoke killing of a Muslim as Haram,” said head of the Assembly of Lebanese Muslim Scholars, Sheikh Ghazi Hanina, in an interview.He lamented that some media outlets have been turned into tools for sowing discord among Islamic Madhhabs instead of raising knowledge and providing guidance.Some satellite channels’ promotion of Takfirism and division among Muslims has led to the killing of Muslims in countries such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen, he said.Talking about the need for unity in the Muslim Ummah, Hanina added that “One of the reasons for the power of Islam is the unity among members of the Islamic Ummah; therefore, unity is a fundamental guarantee of the Ummah’s power and stability.”The source of this unity, he added, is the belief in God, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and the Quran.Referring to the challenges ahead of achieving unity among Muslim nations, the scholar named jurisprudential differences as one of the most dangerous areas.These differences have been a source of discussions since early Islam, he said, adding that the issues should be studied by scholars at Islamic research centers, not by the public.

January 26, 2021 - 1:00 PMThe office of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Sistani, Shia prominent religious authority in Najaf, has answered some questions pertaining to the Coronavirus vaccine.AhlulBayt News Agency (ABNA): The office of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Sistani, Shia prominent religious authority in Najaf, has answered some questions pertaining to the Coronavirus vaccine.The following questions pertaining to the Coronavirus vaccine were sent to his Eminence Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Sistani (DZ) from The Islamic Education Department at the World Federation.Question 1: Vaccines against Coronavirus have already been manufactured by Pfizer, AstraZeneca & Moderna, and others are expected, or already on the market. The medical authorities of several countries have approved these vaccines and authorised mass vaccination programmes, despite some side effects. Some muqallideen are apprehensive about the vaccines’ potential side effects, as the testing & approval processes were expedited by the authorities, given the urgency of the pandemic. Some ethnic groups, based on previous negative experiences with mass vaccination programmes, are sceptical about these vaccines, although no serious side-effects have been observed in most cases. In such circumstances, what does His Eminence advise?Answer 1: In such circumstances, it is appropriate to rely on the advice given by experienced medical experts. As per Shari’ah, it is mandatory to use an approved vaccine in a situation when the probability of suffering from the Coronavirus infection, with its potentially life threatening and/or serious untreatable complications, far outweigh the probable serious side effects of getting vaccinated.Question 2: Governments have set up prioritisation programmes, so that high-risk groups are vaccinated first. This includes, the elderly, public safety officials and others at significant risk. Is it necessary to observe this prioritisation program, or is it permissible to jump the queue by paying money and get vaccinated earlier?Answer 2: It is not permissible to violate the prioritization scheme if its mandated by the law of the land.Question 3: Some developing countries may not have the financial means to procure and make available vaccines for all their citizens. If doctors recommend taking the vaccine, and if private funds do not suffice to procure, distribute and administer the vaccines inside and outside the Jamaat, would His Eminence grant permission to use religious funds for this purpose?Answer 3: In cases where necessary there is no objection.Question 4: If a vaccine manufacturer appeals for volunteers to participate in trials for vaccine efficacy and safety, can mu’mineen join the trial if the manufacturer gives assurance of careful monitoring and caution for the safety of the volunteers, though there may be risk of unexpected side-effects, which in some cases could be lethal?Answer 4: If it has potentially lethal or extremely serious untreatable complications, then it’s not allowed; unless the risk is low and negligible.Question 5: In order to stabilize the vaccine, manufacturers use several additives. Sometimes this can include porcine gelatine. Is it sufficient to rely on the manufacturers’ non-declaration, or declaration of non-usage of such gelatine? If there is a possibility of chemical transformation during the manufacturing process, is it necessary to investigate? If the amount of gelatine is not negligible, would emergency use to prevent a potentially life-threatening infection, justify its inoculation?Answer 5: In all (the above) circumstances there is no legal Shar’i objection.Seal of the Office of Agha Sistani (may his life be lengthened), Najaf e Ashraf.Source: http://www.en.abna24.com/!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Apologies, but no results were found for your request.

For Shi'as, it is the fourth important mosque after al-Masjid al-Haram, al-Masjid al-Nabi, and Masjid al-Aqsa. It is also the oldest and the most important visiting place in Kufa. According to some hadiths, the first person who founded the Mosque of Kufa was Prophet Adam (a). It was reconstructed by Prophet Noah (a) after the storm. In 17/638, when Muslims first entered Kufa in the period of Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas, the mosque was rebuilt together with the governmental building (Dar al-'Imara) at the suggestion of Salman al-Farsi. The mosque has witnessed many prophets (a), Prophet Muhammad (s), Amir al-Mu'minin (a), Imam al-Hasan (a), and Imam al-Husayn (a), and some other Imams (a). In 36/656-7 when Amir al-Mu'minin (a) attended the mosque, it became much more important. He frequently led congregational prayers in this mosque, delivered sermons on its minbar, fulfilled some governmental and judiciary tasks there, and was finally martyred in its mihrab. The mausoleum of Muslim b. 'Aqil, the mausoleum of Maytham al-Tammar, the house of Amir al-Mu'minin (a), the governmental building of Kufa, the mausoleum of Hani b. 'Urwa and al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi's grave are located near the Mosque of Kufa. The mosque has in it a number of positions, in many of which some spiritual practices of the mosque are performed. Just as travelers have the option to say their prayers fully or in a shortened form in al-Masjid al-Haram, the Holy Shrine of Imam al-Husayn (a), and al-Masjid al-Nabi, they have the same option in the Mosque of Kufa as well. There are many hadiths regarding the merits of this mosque. According to some hadiths, the Mosque of Kufa is a garden of the Heaven. If one enters the Mosque of Kufa, one will be forgiven. Kufa will be the center of Imam al-Mahdi's (a) government, and the Mosque of Kufa will be the headquarter of his command. Kufa is a city in Iraq located in the south of the country, ten kilometers on the northeastern side of Najaf. The city was built near Euphrates, it has a temperate climate, and has for long been green. Kufa was first known as ""Suristan"". In 17/638-9, months after the construction of Basra, Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas built Kufa at the command of the Second Caliph as a residence for soldiers and military forces as well as their families during conquests. Soon did Kufa turn into an important Islamic city. It underwent many events. The great mosque of the city in which Imam 'Ali (a) was martyred was built in this period. One of the oldest and most important visiting places in Kufa is the great Mosque of Kufa. The mosque is one of the greatest mosques in the Islamic world, and the fourth important mosque for Shi'as (after al-Masjid al-Haram, al-Masjid al-Nabi, and al-Aqsa mosque). The Mosque of Kufa is with 110 meters of length, 101 meters of width, and has an area of 11162 square meters. Its walls are ten meters hight. The open courtyard of the mosque is 5642 square meters, and the area of its Shabistans is 5520 square meters. The number of its pillars is 187, and it has four minarets each 30 meters tall. The mosque has five gates called: ""Bab al-Hujja"" (the main entrance), ""Bab al-Thu'ban"", ""Bab al-Rahma"", ""Bab Muslim b. 'Aqil"", and ""Bab Hani b. 'Urwa"".[1] According to some hadiths, the construction of the mosque dates back to Prophet Adam (a).[2] It was later reconstructed by Prophet Noah (a) after the storm.[3] In 17/638, the Islamic army was in al-Mada'in. Al-Mada'in's weather was so terrible for soldiers from Hijaz that they became weak and thin. Thus, Hudhayfa b. Yaman wrote a letter to 'Umar b. al-Khattab and informed him about the situation. The Caliph wrote to Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas to ""send Salman and Hudhayfa to find a convenient place [for soldiers]"". When they received the Caliph's letter, Salman and Hudhayfa departed from al-Mada'in: Salman departed from the western bank of Euphrates and Hudhayfa departed from its eastern bank. They did not like any land until they arrived in Kufa. They both found the land appropriate as a residence for the army. They said two rak'as of prayer and asked God to make the place peaceful and stable.[4] When Sa'd b. Abi Waqqas and his army arrived in Kufa, he ordered the construction of a mosque before making any other constructions. Abu Hayja' al-Asadi[5] stood in a place and threw arrows to all directions in order to specify the area of the Mosque of Kufa.[6] The Mosque of Kufa was, since its construction, a cultural center of the city. When Imam 'Ali (a) arrived in Kufa in 36/656, he first went to the Mosque of Kufa and delivered a speech for people there. After settling in Kufa, the Imam (a) taught the exegesis of the Qur'an and other sciences in the mosque. Many people attended his lectures in this mosque, such as Kumayl b. Ziyad and 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas.[7] Asbagh b. Nubata says: addressing people of Kufa, Amir al-Mu'minin (a) referred to the Mosque of Kufa as ""the house of Adam (a), place of Noah (a), residence of Idris (a), worshiping place of Ibrahim (a) and my brother, Khidr (a)"" and ""one of the four mosques selected by God for His people"". The Imam (a) also predicted that the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad) will be installed in this mosque. There will be, he said, a time when the mosque will be the worshiping place of Imam al-Mahdi (a) and every believer.[8] There are places in this mosque which are attributed to prophets (a) or prominent religious figures. These are called ""Maqam"" (position). Some recommended prayers or practices are recommended for some of these positions. There are recommended practices for the Mosque of Kufa, including ziyara, prayers, and specific supplications mentioned in the practices of the Mosque of Kufa in Mafatih al-jinan. According to a number of hadiths, Kufa will be the center of the global government of Imam al-Mahdi (a). Mufaddal b. 'Umar asked Imam al-Sadiq (a) about where Imam al-Mahdi (a) will govern. He replied: the center of his government will be Kufa, his governmental building will be the Great Mosque of Kufa, and his treasury (and the place where booties of wars will be distributed) will be the al-Sahla Mosque.[30]",,,,
where did the term shooting brake come from,"""Shooting-brake"" originated as an early 19th century British term for a vehicle used to carry shooting parties with their equipment and game. The etymology of the term brake is uncertain; initially a chassis used to break in horses, and subsequently used to describe a motorized vehicle.

where did the tradition of carving pumpkins start,"The carving of vegetables has been a common practice in many parts of the world, and gourds were one of the earliest plant species domesticated by humans c. 10,000 years ago. For example, gourds were used to carve lanterns by the Maori over 700 years ago; the Māori word for a gourd also describes a lampshade.","A Jack-o’-lantern is a carved pumpkin or similarly-sized gourd or turnip, associated chiefly with the holiday of Halloween, and was named after the phenomenon of strange light flickering over peat bogs, called will-o’-the-wisp or jack-o’-lantern. In a jack-o’-lantern, the top is cut off to form a lid, and the inside flesh is then scooped out; an image, usually a monstrous face, is carved out of the pumpkin’s rind to expose the hollow interior. To create the lantern effect, a light source is placed within before the lid is closed, traditionally a candle flame. It is common to see jack-o’-lanterns on doorsteps and otherwise used as decorations during Halloween. The term jack-o’-lantern is in origin a term for the visual phenomenon ignis fatuus (literally, “foolish fire”) known as a will-o’-the-wisp in English folklore. Used especially in East Anglia, its earliest known use dates to the 1660s. The term “will-o’-the-wisp” uses “wisp” (a bundle of sticks or paper sometimes used as a torch) and the proper name “Will”: thus, “Will-of-the-torch.” The term jack-o’-lantern is of the same construction: “Jack of [the] lantern.” The carving of root vegetables may appear to be a way of utilising usually unwanted oversized harvest but records of Man performing this task date back hundreds, if not thousands of years. Gourds were used to carve lanterns by the Maori over 700 years ago, with the Māori word for a gourd also used to describe a lampshade. There is a common belief that the custom of carving jack-o’-lanterns at Hallowe’en originated in Ireland, where turnips, mangelwurzel or beetroot were supposedly used. The carvings were said to represent spirits or goblins around the festival of Samhain. Conversely, other theories suggest they were simply ornate lanterns or even perhaps the representation of souls stuck in purgatory. Although study into Irish folklore has found no specific records of turnip lanterns, English accounts record something very similar, turnips being used to carve what was called a “Hoberdy’s Lantern” in Worcestershire at the end of the 18th century. These were placed randomly atop hedgerows to ward off ne’er-do-well travellers. More precise accounts are recorded from the early 1800s across Europe but in particular, the British Isles, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy and Spain. Irish tales speak of Stingy Jack, also known as Jack the Smith, Drunk Jack, and Jack of the Lantern, a character always associated with All Hallows Eve. It is common lore that the “jack-o’-lantern” is derived from the Jack of this legend. The most repeated account tells of a drunkard known as “Stingy Jack”, known throughout the land as a deceiver, manipulator and otherwise dreg of society. On a fateful night, the devil overheard the tale of Jack’s evil deeds and silver tongue. Unconvinced (and envious) of the rumours, the devil went to find out for himself whether or not Jack lived up to his vile reputation. Lo’, the inevitably drunken Jack staggered home one night and found a body on his cobblestone path. The body with an eerie grimace on its face turned out to be Satan. Jack realised this was his end; Satan had finally come to collect his malevolent soul. Jack made a last request: he asked Satan to let him drink ale before he departed to Hades. Finding no reason not to acquiesce the request, Satan took Jack to the local pub and supplied him with many alcoholic beverages. Upon quenching his thirst, Jack asked Satan to pay the tab on the ale, to Satan’s surprise. Jack convinced Satan to metamorphose into a silver coin with which to pay the bartender (impressed upon by Jack’s unyielding nefarious tactics). Shrewdly, Jack stuck the now transmogrified Satan (coin) into his pocket, which also contained a crucifix. The crucifix’s presence kept Satan from escaping his form. This coerced Satan to agree to Jack’s demand: in exchange for Satan’s freedom, he had to spare Jack’s soul for ten years. Ten years later to the date when Jack originally struck his deal, he found himself once again in Satan’s presence. Jack happened upon Satan in the same setting as before and seemingly accepted it was his time to go to Hades for good. As Satan prepared to take him to Hades, Jack asked if he could have one apple to feed his starving belly. Foolishly Satan once again agreed to this request. As Satan climbed up the branches of a nearby apple tree, Jack surrounded its base with crucifixes. Satan, frustrated at the fact that he been entrapped again, demanded his release. As Jack did before, he made a demand: that his soul never be taken by Satan into Hades. Satan agreed and was set free. Eventually, the drinking and unstable lifestyle took its toll on Jack; he died the way he lived. As Jack’s soul prepared to enter Heaven through the gates of St. Peter he was stopped. Jack was told by God that because of his sinful lifestyle of deceitfulness and drinking, he was not allowed into Heaven. The dreary Jack went before the Gates of Hades and begged for commission into the underworld. Satan, fulfilling his obligation to Jack, could not take his soul. To warn others, he gave Jack an ember, marking him a denizen of the netherworld. From that day on until eternity’s end, Jack is doomed to roam the world between the planes of good and evil, with only an ember inside a hollowed turnip (“turnip” actually referring to a large swede) to light his way. On a very basic level, Jack o’ lanterns were also a way of protecting your home against the undead. Superstitious people used them specifically to ward away vampires as it was said that the Jack-o-lantern’s light was a way of identifying the fiends and, once their identity was known, would give up their hunt for you. The American tradition of carving pumpkins (chosen because of their profusion and bright colour) is first recorded in 1837 and was originally associated with harvest time in general, not becoming specifically associated with Halloween until later in the 19th century. The tradition of carving pumpkins is still largely associated with the USA and Americans have concocted many recipes to ensure masses of gigantic orange vegetables do not go to waste. As global trends spread, pumpkin carving is rapidly becoming a must around the world too… The carving of pumpkins has progressed from a craggy-toothed will-this-do effigy to a true art-form. Popular figures, symbols, and logos are now seen used on pumpkins, a variety of tools used to carve and hollow out the gourd, ranging from simple knives and spoons to specialised instruments. Candles are sometimes replaced with electric light of various colours to enhance the end result. So competitive has the pursuit become that pumpkins are sometimes grown into moulds so that usually impossible creations can be attempted. All US releases unless stated.","This is the time of year when the weather has started getting progressively worse, when the first of salvos the annual bombardment of Christmas adverts begin, and of course when people dress up as miscellaneous undead and carve Jack-o-lanterns for Halloween. In the liturgical calendar Halloween is a time to remember the dead, in particular the saints (the hallowed) and martyrs. This kind of festival is done all over the world. In Japan the day of the dead occurs on the 15th of August (or July), the bon festival where the spirits of the ancestors return to the world of the living. Often a candle is put outside the front door so that your forebears can find their way home. This is similar to the idea behind the jack-o-lantern which acts as the reverse of the Japanese tradition, it is used to ward away the evil spirits. The legend behind the jack-o-lantern tells the story of an Irishman called Stingy Jack, a drunk, deceiving and manipulating all-round dreg of society. Jack’s bad reputation became the envy of the Devil himself, who subsequently went out to see for himself if Jack was as bad as he had heard. One night Jack was stumbling through the countryside, typically drunk. At one point he came across a body on the cobblestone path, its face contorted in an eerie grimace. Jack eventually, and surprisingly soberly, realized that the corpse was, in fact, the Devil, come to collect his evil soul. Jack pleaded one last request, that he be allowed one last drink of ale. Seeing no reason to refuse the Devil took Jack to a nearby pub and ordered several rounds of ale which Jack duly consumed. Once Jack had slaked his thirst he told the Devil to pay the bill. Somewhat taken  aback, and presumably lacking in money, the Devil decided that the best course of action was to turn himself into a silver coin for Jack to give to the bar keeper. Jack, however, put the silver coin into his pocket, which also contained a crucifix. Trapped by the power of the cross the devil could not turn himself back. Foiled by Jack’s cunning the Devil had no choice but to agree to Jack’s demand, namely to spare his soul for the next ten years. The bar man presumably was never paid. Ten years later to the day and the Devil returned to collect Jack’s soul. However, the Devil had clearly forgotten the cunning Irishman’s previous trick. Jack had another final request. He claimed that he was starving and asked if the Devil would pick him an apple from a nearby tree. Foolishly the Devil acquiesced and climbed up the tree. At this point Jack surrounded the base of the tree with crucifixes, thereby trapping the Devil yet again. This time, to bargain for his freedom, the Devil was forced into declaring that he would never lay claim to Jack’s soul ever again. That would seem to have been the end of the matter. However, soon after Jack’s binge drinking caught up with him and his soul appeared before St Peter at the Pearly Gates of Heaven. St Peter reminded Jack of his sinful life and that in view of the multitude of transgressions Jack would not be allowed into Heaven. Seeing no alternative Jack went to the Gates of Hell and begged the Devil to let him in. The Devil, true to his previous promise, also refused Jack entry. Jack was cursed to roam the world for eternity, and to warn others he was given an ember from Hell that never died. Jack placed this ember in a hollowed out turnip to use as a lantern to light his way, becoming known as Jack of the Lantern. The earliest account of this story comes from the 19th century and explains the name jack-o-lantern.The origin of the tradition of lantern carving is somewhat more uncertain. The practice of carving vegetables in this manner is virtually universal, it is likely that carving gourds has been happening for thousands of years. The Maori people even used to carve gourds to use as lanterns 700 years ago, the Maori word for gourd is also used to describe a lamp-shade.  In Ireland, where the jack-o-lantern tradition is said to have originated, turnips and beetroots were carved into faces on All Saints’ Day (November 1st) to represent the people in purgatory, ward away evil spirits and to guide the guisers (trick-or-treaters). The tradition of a carved pumpkin came much later, at the end of the 19th century. Predictably it came from the United States where the pumpkin had long been a symbol of the harvest season. Originally the pumpkin had primarily been a thing reserved for Thanksgiving. An article from 1900 regarding Thanksgiving entertainment even suggested having a lit jack-o-lantern as part of the festivities. The first recorded use of a pumpkin as a jack-o-lantern with regards to Halloween was in 1866. Since then it has become the norm with sales of pumpkins booming in the days proceeding Halloween. Of course, today they are not only used to depict scary faces but also to display artistic talent (the most impressive that I have seen this year was a really detailed carving of King Kong’s face).

Gourd crafting may be the perfect way for you to get creative while still connecting with the fruits of your garden harvest! Over the centuries, gourds have been adapted from simple utilitarian use to incredible works of art. As a result, gourd crafting has become important to cultures around the world especially in South America and Africa, and increasingly as a popular hobby in North America. Gourds provide a 3-dimensional canvas that is very versatile in its shape, size, and use. You can cut, carve, paint, and embellish them with natural materials such as stone, feathers, plants, etc. The end result can be both functional and ornamental.  There is a saying in the gourd craft world that “if the artist can ‘think it’, then the gourd can ‘be it’!” Have a question on specific gardening programs in your community?

Many people know the National Archives as the custodian of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights – the three main formative documents of the U.S. and its government. It is also the keeper of a copy of the Magna Carta, confirmed by Edward I in 1297. Other important historical documents maintained at the National Archives include the Louisiana Purchase Treaty, the Emancipation Proclamation, and collections of photography, art works, and other historically and culturally significant artifacts.  But they also maintain the public records about and for ordinary American citizens, such as textual and microfilm records relating to genealogy, census data, American Indians, the District of Columbia, maritime matters, charts, architectural and engineering drawings, and the records of the U.S. Congress and all Federal government agencies. Opened as its original headquarters in 1935, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration Building is located approximately halfway between The White House and the U.S. Capitol Building, between 7th and 9th Streets at 700 Pennsylvania Avenue (MAP) in downtown D.C. Known informally as Archives I, the building has entrances on Pennsylvania Avenue and on Constitution Avenue just north of the National Mall. Designed by architect John Russell Pope, the National Archives and Records Administration building was intended to be on par with the other national monuments and symbols on the National Mall. The massive building covers two full city blocks, and is among the most impressive and architecturally striking buildings on the National Mall. During the cornerstone ceremony conducted in 1933, President Herbert Hoover stated, “This temple of our history will appropriately be one of the most beautiful buildings in America, an expression of the American soul.” The National Archives building is highly decorated with pediments, sculptures, medallions, and classical carvings. Imbedded in its size and beauty, the building has specific messages and symbolism in the inscriptions that encircle the building, and the sculptures that surround it. The inscriptions declare the building’s goals. On the west side of the building is inscribed, “The glory and romance of our history are here preserved in the chronicles of those who conceived and builded the structure of our nation.” The inscription on the east side of the building states, “This building holds in trust the records of our national life and symbolizes our faith in the permanency of our national institutions.” And the south side inscription reads, “The ties that bind the lives of our people in one indissoluble union are perpetuated in the archives of our government and to their custody this building is dedicated.” The four massive statues around the National Archives building were each was cut from a single block of limestone weighing 125 tons. Sculptor Robert I. Aitken’s statue “The Future” sits on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the building to the left of the main entrance. The young woman appears to lift her eyes from the pages of an open book and gaze into the future. Its base is inscribed with a line inspired by Shakespeare’s play The Tempest: “What is Past is Prologue.” To the right of the main entrance is another sculpture by Aitken, entitled “The Past,” which depicts an aged figure with a scroll and closed book imparting the knowledge of past generations.”  The words on the base enjoin, “Study the Past.” To the rear of the building on Constitution Avenue sit “Heritage” and “Guardianship,” both sculpted by James Earle Fraser. Heritage is located to the right of the entrance, and depicts a woman who holds a child and a sheaf of wheat in her right hand as symbols of growth and hopefulness. In her left hand she protects an urn, symbolic of the ashes of past generations. The base is inscribed, “The Heritage of the Past is the Seed that Brings Forth the Harvest of the future.” And finally, “Guardianship,” to the left of the rear entrance, uses martial symbols, such as the helmet, sword, and lion skin to convey the need to protect the historical record for future generations. This sculpture is inscribed “Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty.” A visit to the National Archives can be very productive in terms of research and information. But the building itself can make a visit worthwhile, even if you don’t go inside. Excellent post, full of good information.  Thanks very much. Notify me of new comments via email.

It is also charged with increasing public access to those documents. NARA is officially responsible for maintaining and publishing the legally authentic and authoritative copies of acts of Congress, presidential proclamations and executive orders, and federal regulations. The chief administrator of NARA, the Archivist of the United States, not only maintains the official documentation of the passage of amendments to the U.S. Constitution by state legislatures, but has the authority to declare when the constitutional threshold for passage has been reached, and therefore when an act has become an amendment. NARA has been active in digitizing their holdings to make them easily accessible to the public. Since 2006, NARA collaborated with Google, Footnote, and CreateSpace to foster its digitization projects which include digitization of historical films and photos as well as documents. Originally, each branch and agency of the U.S. government was responsible for maintaining its own documents, which often resulted in the loss and destruction of records. Congress established the National Archives Establishment in 1934 to centralize federal record keeping, with the Archivist of the United States as its chief administrator. The National Archives was incorporated into the General Services Administration in 1949, but, in 1985, it was made an independent agency as NARA. Most of the documents in the care of NARA are in the public domain, as works of the federal government are excluded from copyright protection. However, some documents that have come into the care of NARA from other sources may still be protected by copyright or donor agreements.[1] NARA also stores classified documents and its Information Security Oversight Office monitors and sets policy for the U.S. government's security classification system. NARA's holdings are classified into ""record groups"" reflecting the governmental department or agency from which they originated. The records including paper records, microfilmed records, still pictures, motion pictures, and electronic media. Many of NARA's most requested records are frequently used for research in genealogy. This includes census records from 1790 to 1930, as well as ship passenger lists and naturalization records. As the nation’s record keeper, it is our vision that all Americans will understand the vital role records play in a democracy, and their own personal stake in the National Archives. Our holdings and diverse programs will be available to more people than ever before through modern technology and dynamic partnerships. The stories of our nation and our people are told in the records and artifacts cared for in NARA facilities around the country. We want all Americans to be inspired to explore the records of their country.[2] The National Archives and Records Administration serves American democracy by safeguarding and preserving the records of our Government, ensuring that the people can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage. We ensure continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their government. We support democracy, promote civic education, and facilitate historical understanding of our national experience.[2] The National Archives Building, known informally as Archives I, located north of the National Mall on Constitution Avenue in Washington, DC, opened as its original headquarters in 1935. It holds the original copies of the three main formative documents of the United States and its government: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. It also hosts the Magna Carta confirmed by Edward I in 1297.[3] These are displayed to the public in the main chamber of the National Archives, which is called the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom. Flash photography of the documents is prohibited, because the flashes can over time fade out the documents. There are no lines to see individual documents (although there is a line to reach the rotunda itself) at the National Archives, and visitors are allowed to walk from document to document as they wish. The National Archives Building also exhibits other important American historical documents such as the Louisiana Purchase and the Emancipation Proclamation, as well as collections of photography and other historically and culturally significant American artifacts. Due to space constraints, NARA opened a second facility, known informally as Archives II, in 1994 near the University of Maryland, College Park campus. The two institutions engage in multiple initiatives.[4] There are ten Affiliated Archives locations across the US which hold, by formal, written agreement with NARA,""[5] accessioned records. There are also fourteen Regional Archives facilities across the country with available research rooms and two major facilities in St. Louis, Missouri which comprise the National Personnel Records Center. However, the National Archives Building in downtown Washington still contains such record collections as all existing Federal Census records, Ship Passenger Lists, military unit records from the American Revolution up to the Philippine-American War, records of the Confederate Government, the Freedmen's Bureau records and pension/land records. NARA also maintains the Presidential Library system, a nationwide network of libraries for preserving and making available the documents of U.S. presidents since Herbert Hoover. The Presidential Libraries include: Libraries and museums have been established for other presidents, but they are not part of the NARA presidential library system, and are operated by private foundations, historical societies, or state governments, including the William McKinley, Rutherford Hayes, Calvin Coolidge, Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson libraries. For example, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is owned and operated by the State of Illinois. The National Archives maintains a Nixon Presidential Materials Project at its Archives II facility in College Park, Maryland. The ""Nixon Project"" is currently (2007) transferring all of their materials to the newly-opened Richard Nixon Presidential Library & Museum in Yorba Linda, California. In March 2006, it was revealed by the Archivist of the United States in a public hearing that a memorandum of understanding between NARA and various government agencies existed to ""reclassify,"" i.e withdraw from public access, certain documents in the name of national security, and to do so in a manner such that researchers would not be likely to discover the process.[6] The National Archives aims to make its holdings more widely available and more easily accessible by entering into public-private partnerships. In 2006, NARA announced a joint-venture with Google to digitize and offer NARA video online. This pilot program represents an evolutionary step for the National Archives to achieve its goal of becoming an archives without walls, as explained in the NARA press release. This innovative partnership is just one step in a strategic plan which emphasizes the importance of providing access to records anytime, anywhere. This is one of many initiatives that NARA is launching to expand opportunities for the public to be able to view NARA's collections.[7] In early 2007, the National Archives and Footnote launched a pilot project to digitize historic documents. The NARA press release explained that this partnership will allow much greater access to approximately 4.5 million pages of important documents that are currently available only in their original format or on microfilm. No less important, the digitization of documents will also enhance NARA's efforts to preserve its original records.[8] In late 2007, the National Archives announced it would make thousands of historical films available for purchase through CreateSpace (an Amazon.com subsidiary) which specializes in on-demand distribution of DVDs, CDs and books. The NARA press release emphasized the potential benefits for the public-at-large and for the National Archives. At NARA facilities, the public can continue to view films and even copy them at no charge; this new program will make NARA's holdings much more accessible to those who cannot travel to the Washington, DC area. At the same time, the NARA-CreateSpace partnership will provide the National Archives with digital reference and preservation copies of the films as part of NARA's preservation program.[9] The Archivist of the United States is the chief official overseeing the operation of the National Archives and Records Administration. The first Archivist, R.D.W. Connor, began serving in 1934, when the National Archive was established by Congress. The Archivists served as subordinate officials in other government agencies until the National Archives and Records Administration became an independent agency on April 1, 1985. Allen Weinstein is now serving as the ninth Archivist, having been sworn in on February 16, 2005. The Archivist is responsible for safeguarding and making available for study all important public documents of the nation, including the actual Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which are displayed in the Archives' main building in Washington, D.C.. Under Public Law No. 98-497, the Archivist also must maintain custody of state legislative ratifications of amendments to the United States Constitution and proclaim a particular amendment duly ratified and part of the Constitution, if the legislatures of at least three-quarters of the states approve the proposed amendment.

difference between an oak tree and a live oak tree,"The name live oak comes from the fact that evergreen oaks remain green and ""live"" throughout winter, when other oaks are dormant and leafless. The name is used mainly in North America, where evergreen oaks are widespread in warmer areas along the Atlantic coast from southeast Virginia to Florida, west along the Gulf Coast to Louisiana and Mexico, and across the southwest to California.","Message summary: Today the benefits of the tree of life are freely available to all of us in Jesus Christ. Many ignore His call, reject Him, or scorn His name but the Word of God declares: “Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12,13). Due to travel we did not prepare a podcast for this message. We are enjoying our trip south and the warm temperatures. For the last several days we’ve been visiting my sister and brother-in-law, Genelle and Cesar Sankarsingh. Wherever we travel we enjoy the variety of trees along the highway. A species we do not see in our northern climate are the wide spread live oaks, which are abundant in the south. I first recall hearing about the live oak while touring many years ago the USS Constitution in Boston Harbor. This ship first launched in 1797 and is still a commissioned US Navy vessel. The tour guide explained that it was constructed with live oak, known for its durability and hardness. I have had oaks wherever I have lived and was puzzled by the designation “live” oak since the other oaks wherever I have lived were certainly also alive. The name live oak comes from the fact that evergreen oaks remain green and “live” throughout winter, when other oaks are dormant and leafless. The oldest live oaks in the country are estimated to be between several hundred to over a thousand years old. After the creation account one of the first notable trees in the Bible is the Oak of the Moreh, first mentioned in Genesis 12:6 which had a long and significant lifespan.* But today let us consider the “tree of life”. I enjoy relating to foresters and learned a great deal from several who attended the church I pastored in northern Pennsylvania years ago. Foresters work with trees which have the distinction of being referenced in the Bible from the first chapter (Genesis 1:11) right through to the last chapter with many references between. When Adam was banned from the garden the specific reason for this banishment was so that he could not “reach out  his  hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever” (Genesis 3:22). At the end of the Bible we again see several references to this tree of life. Apparently it will be a major attraction in our eternal home (Revelation 2:7; 22:14). As such it surely must be the longest living tree! One Bible version titles this chapter “Eden Restored”. The life-giving ministry of Jesus Christ fulfills for the believer the blessings of the tree of life. Fundamentally man has two great quests in life: One is for eternal life and Jesus meets this need. The Bible says, “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16). Man’s second great quest is for abundant life (full and meaningful). Jesus meets this need as well. He said, “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10). Today the benefits of the tree of life are freely available to all of us in Jesus Christ. Many ignore His call, reject Him, or scorn His name but the Word of God declares: “Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12,13). Receive and share this merciful gift of life through Christ Jesus today! Daily prayer:  Jesus, Your sacrificial death on the cross became the tree of life for all who believe. It is the highest expression of love not only for those who bore the nails in your hands and shouted “Crucify, crucify” but it’s for all the generations who follow that were born under the sin curse. How grateful we are that You came from the glories of heaven to crush the head of the serpent, as You conquered death through Your miraculous resurrection so that we might be redeemed from the law of sin.  We will partake of the tree of life in heaven because You partook of the cross of death here on earth. All glory and praise is due Your name. Amen. A view of Saint Augustine from the top of the Saint Augustine lighthouse. We enjoyed a nice lunch at Columbia Restaurant in St. Petersburg with Genelle and Cesar.

The greatest amount of termite activity is in the Southern and Western parts of the U.S. because termites thrive in warmer climates. Drywood termites their homes in dry, sturdy wood and as they burrow into wood as they carve out sections of it – leaving behind droppings or “frass.” They’re found along the East Coast, ranging from the Mid-Atlantic states to South Florida, also along the Gulf Coast, throughout the Southwest into California. There’s even one species in Hawaii. The Southeastern Drywood Termite is the most common – found in the South and Southeast. The West Indian Drywood Termite is common to the South and Southeast regions. It’s the only only drywood termite found in Hawaii. The Western Drywood Termite is found in the Western and Southwestern U.S. And occasionally in the Southeast. The Desert Drywood Termite favors Arizona and sections of southern California. Subterranean Termites live underground and are the most common and destructive group of termites in the U.S.  As they burrow through wood they create a distinctive honeycomb pattern and  are able to form tunnels within softer spring-wood. They usually leave external grain intact. With serious damage the wood breaks off easily to reveal mud or soil filled galleries. The Eastern Subterranean Termite is found in the Eastern half of the country. The Dark and Light Southeastern Subterranean Termites are found in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the U.S. The Formosan Subterranean Termite is native to China. It’s the most destructive termite species found in most Southeastern states and southern California. This is the only subterranean termite species that’s found in Hawaii. The Western Subterranean Termite is found in the West, but have also been found as far east as Idaho and Nevada. The Arid Land Subterranean Termite is found in the prairie regions of the Rocky Mountain states. This is also the most common termite found in Arizona. The Desert Subterranean Termite lives mostly in southern Arizona and parts of California. Need help in Glendale?

The “velvet” is a gray fuzz that covers the young twigs and leaves. Young trees are pyramidal, but the shape becomes more rounded and open as mature height is reached. Deciduous tree, up to 30 feet tall or more. The Bonita Ash is gaining popularity for its lush, broad canopy and flashy yellow/orange display of color in autumn. Once established, it is drought tolerant and requires minimal supplemental irrigation to sustain dense, green foliage through the summer months. It is a fast grower and withstands high winds. Originally cultivated in San Antonio for its smooth, glossy leaflets and increased tolerance to alkalinity. It makes an excellent shade tree for hot summer regions. It matures at about 35 feet with a spreading rounded canopy. It is a heat tolerant shade tree with a yellow fall color. Fan Tex is considered to be fast growing. This Ash is a fine-textured, deciduous tree which commonly grows to be 40 to 50 feet tall with a 25 foot spread in a landscape, opening into a full, rounded canopy with age. Young trees are somewhat upright or oval. The lustrous, dark green leaflets create a light shade beneath the tree The leaves turn various shades of red to purple before falling in autumn. This lofty, deciduous conifer grows 50-75 ft. or taller. It is slender and conical in youth, becoming flat-topped in very old age. Sage-green leaves resemble feathers and  turn copper-colored before falling. A tapering trunk is slightly buttressed at the swollen base. Knees develop mostly in poorly drained situations. Exfoliating bark is red-brown to silver. The Chinese pistache tree is a notable ornamental tree, especially during the fall season when the normally dark green foliage changes to a dramatic profusion of orange and red leaves. An excellent shade tree with a broad canopy, Chinese pistache can reach heights of between 30-60 feet.It fulfills a valuable niche for wildlife as birds love the berries. The cedar elm grows to a height of 50–70' and a spread of 40–60' at maturity. It grows at a medium rate, with height increases of 13–24"" per year. The cedar elm has been a favorite street tree for towns in the desert southwest due to its ability to survive in difficult soil types with little care. It is very drought-tolerant but can also grow in ground that is periodically saturated. This tree is considered both a shade tree and an ornamental tree. Lacebark elm is a medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to 30-50 feet. Due to its medium-fast growth rate, hardiness and visual qualities, it is often planted as a landscape tree. Leaves typically turn an dull yellow in fall and sometimes produce more interesting yellows or reddish-purples. This tree has mottled bark and once the tree matures the bark flakes to reveal patches of gray, cream, orange, brown and green.The bark resembles camouflage. If you are looking for a pine tree that grows fast with a straight trunk and attractive needles, the Loblolly pine may be your tree. It can grow more than 2 feet per year. It can grow to 90 feet but usually remains under 50 feet under landscape conditions. The loblolly is a tall attractive evergreen with yellow to dark-green needles up to 10 inches long. The columnar trunk of the loblolly is also very lovely, covered with reddish-brown plates of bark. Loblolly pine. A rapidly growing deciduous tree native to central and northeastern Mexico. It has very large, beautiful, maple-shaped bright green leaves, with soft-white, fuzzy undersides. The most stunning quality about this tree is its bark: a living work of art that gets more beautiful and intricate with age. It can get up to 80 feet tall in nature, but in most landscapes will only reach 50 feet, with a canopy of 30 feet wide. Usually wider than tall, this tree can exceed 100 ft. in height and width. The species name macrocarpa, refers to the golf ball sized acorns of this tree. The leaves of bur oak also are large, so they are easy to rake. Bur oak is drought resistant, long-lived and reasonably fast-growing for an oak. Tolerates limey soils better than other oaks. Resistant to oak wilt and a number of other problems. The chinquapin oak grows to a height of 40–50' and a spread of 50–60' at maturity. It features a spreading canopy capable of blocking sunlight and adds visual interest and beauty to landscaping. With its strong branches and interesting leaves, the chinquapin oak makes a beautiful statement.The magnificent oak also adds to the ambiance by drawing a variety of wildlife with its acorns. Leaves expand as a soft pink color, turning a handsome blue–green as they mature lending the plant an intriguing smoky air. The foliage is seldom bothered by insects or disease. Fall color varies from brown to yellow. Growth habit will vary with local environmental conditions, with the ultimate size ranging in most cultivated landscapes from 30' to 35' in height and spread. One of the best attributes of Lacey oak is it's picturesque irregularly rounded crown. The live oak tree is a southern symbol of strength. The name live oaks came from the fact that they remain green and ""alive"" throughout the winter when other oak trees are dormant and leafless. Once established a live oak will grow about 2-4 feet overall and 1 inch of caliper per year. It is the broadest spreading of the oaks producing an abundance of shade. Mexican white oak is a quickly growing tree, which means it can add more than 24 inches to its height in a single growing season. As oaks go, it is medium-size, a class that includes plants from 36 to 72 feet. It is capable of growing to a height of 80 feet and a width of 60 feet when fully mature. Because it is sensitive to its growing environment, Mexican white oak may grow taller and adapt better to warmer climates in addition to keeping its leaves. Quercus shumardii is a relatively fast-growing and adaptable oak. Shumard's oak is a pyramidal tree, growing 50-90 ft. and becoming more open at maturity. This species is quite drought resistant and also withstands short-term flooding. It is similar to the Texas or Spanish oak, but prefers deeper soils and tends to grow taller and straighter. Provides good fall foliage color. Named for Benjamin Franklin Shumard (1820-69), state geologist of Texas. Quercus Canbyi, a red oak, naturally grows in a pyramidal shape while it is young, developing a broader canopy after several years. This beautiful tree can grow in any area throughout Texas. Although it's classified as an evergreen, it will shed a majority of its leaves in the late winter much like Live or Mexican Oak. New foliage is red before turning a rich green color, turning red again in the fall. Leaves are up to three inches long, and resemble a holly leaf. Usually a medium-sized tree to 35 feet tall with one or more trunks 10"" in diameter, but can reach heights of 70 feet on fertile sites.Texas Red Oak is smaller and more drought tolerant than Shumard Red Oak. The foliage turns bright shades of vivid red and orange in autumn. Be aware that all red oak species are susceptible to oak wilt disease. This species was named for Samuel B. Buckley, (1809–1884) botanist and state geologist of Texas. latejanatreesales.com © All Rights Reserved",Ensure the page you are linking to exists in the correct folder.

how many mg in 1 unit of alcohol,"One unit of alcohol (UK) is defined as 10 millilitres (8 grams) of pure alcohol. Typical drinks (i.e., typical quantities or servings of common alcoholic beverages) may contain 1 -- 3 units of alcohol.","Cannabis remains one of the most universally abused recreational drugs. Cannabis abuse can have several cardiovascular adverse effects and an overdose can lead to cardiac arrest. Binge alcohol drinking and subsequent withdrawal in the background of cannabis overdose can lead to convulsion and QT prolongation leading to malignant arrhythmia. We report two cases of ventricular fibrillation complicated with seizure precipitated by cannabis overdose and alcohol withdrawal. Such serious clinical presentation complicated with cardiac arrest does not necessarily lead to a fatal outcome if timely medical attention and care are provided. Timely aggressive resuscitative measures combined with intensive care can lead to a successful outcome. Later on, psychiatric counseling and occupational and behavioral therapies can help them to live longer. Cannabis remains one of the most universally abused recreational drugs worldwide and its popularity has increased considerably due to the recent legalization and medicinal use [1-5]. Sometimes, cannabis overuse can lead to malignant arrhythmia leading to cardiac arrest [5,6]. Alcohol withdrawal following binge drinking combined with cannabis abuse can lead to malignant arrhythmia, seizure, and at times culminating in cardiac arrest [2,5,6]. We report two cases of ventricular fibrillation (VF) complicated with seizure caused by cannabis overdose and alcohol withdrawal following binge drinking. Cannabis abuse can also lead to serious cardiac dysrhythmia complicated with seizure and ultimately cardiac arrest. If timely and proper resuscitative efforts are instituted, these patients can have a successful outcome. The patients’ consents were obtained. © 2018 The Author(s).

It is a common measure of the amount of alcohol present in any given volume of alcoholic drink and is expressed in alcohol percentage. It shows how much alcohol (ethanol – chemical compound) content there is in a beverage. A Unit of alcohol is used to indicate the actual alcohol quantity within a volume of alcoholic substance and to provide information on total alcohol consumption. One unit of alcohol contains 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure alcohol. Typical servings of drinks usually contain 1-3 units of alcohol. Gravity in alcoholic beverages refers to specific gravity or relative density of the substance (wort or must) compared to the density of reference substance usually water. Gravity is measured by hydrometer. The density of a wort or must is influenced by their sugar content. The amplitude between the original (gravity before fermentation) and final gravity (measured when fermentation completes) indicates how much sugar has changed into alcohol and hence the bigger the difference, the more alcohol content present and the stronger the drink. Oxygen exposure to wine improves its taste because it softens the acerbic tannins and releases the fruit and floral aromas. So this is why wine is poured into decanters and wide wine glasses. The Units utilized for wine volume are the same as some standard volume units such as ounces, liters, milliliters. The names of the containers are also used for units for wine volumes such as glass and bottle.","Main was a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's Niles Center branch, now known as the Yellow Line.

Units of alcohol are used in the United Kingdom (UK) as a measure to quantify the actual alcoholic content within a given volume of an alcoholic beverage, in order to provide guidance on total alcohol consumption. A number of other countries (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US) use the concept of a ""standard drink"", the definition of which varies from country to country, for the same purpose.  ""Standard drinks"" were referred to in the first UK guidelines (1984) that published ""safe limits"" for drinking, but these were replaced by references to ""alcohol units"" in the 1987 guidelines and the latter term has been used in all subsequent UK guidance. One unit of alcohol (UK) is defined as 10 millilitres (8 grams) of pure alcohol.  Typical drinks (i.e. typical quantities or servings of common alcoholic beverages) may contain 1–3 units of alcohol. Containers of alcoholic beverages sold directly to UK consumers are normally labelled to indicate the number of units of alcohol in a typical serving of the beverage (optional) and in the full container (can or bottle), as well as information about responsible drinking.  Additionally, the advent of smartphones has led to the creation of apps which report the number of units contained in an alcoholic drink. Military organization or military organisation is the structuring of the armed forces of a state so as to offer military capability required by the national defense policy. In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces, though not considered military. Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as insurgent forces, often mimic military organizations, or use ad hoc structures. Military organization is hierarchical. The use of formalized ranks in a hierarchical structure came into widespread use with the Roman Army. In modern times, executive control, management and administration of military organization is typically undertaken by the government through a government department within the structure of public administration, often known as a Ministry of Defense, Department of Defense, or Department of War. These in turn manage Armed Services that themselves command combat, combat support and service support formations and units.",,,,,,,
where are bobcats located in the united states,"The bobcat is an adaptable animal. It prefers woodlands -- deciduous, coniferous, or mixed -- but unlike the other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.",.. everything you want to know about animals is so close..,,,,,,,,,
what is the standardized coefficient in a regression,"In statistics, standardized coefficients or beta coefficients are the estimates resulting from a regression analysis that have been standardized so that the variances of dependent and independent variables are 1. Therefore, standardized coefficients refer to how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change, per standard deviation increase in the predictor variable. For univariate regression, the absolute value of the standardized coefficient equals the correlation coefficient. Standardization of the coefficient is usually done to answer the question of which of the independent variables have a greater effect on the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis, when the variables are measured in different units of measurement (for example, income measured in dollars and family size measured in number of individuals).","One of the outputs of a Species Distribution Modelling experiment is the Variable Importance Plots (VIP), which can assist in understanding the contribution of environmental predictor variables to the model outputs. Our colleagues Assoc Prof Sama Low-Choy and Dr John Xie at Griffith University have written a special R function (VIPplot) for us to incorporate into the BCCVL to generate these plots. The plots are based on algorithm-specific outputs, and are currently available for the following algorithms: CTA, GAM, Maxent, GLM, GBM, RF and ANN. Depending on what is appropriate for each algorithm, the variable importance plots differ in assessment method. This plot is only included for the GLM algorithm. The effect size measures the variable importance in terms of goodness-of-fit, and is here defined as the absolute values of the standardised regression coefficients (also referred to as the beta weights). Standardised coefficients refer to how many standard deviations the response variable will change per a standard deviation increase in the predictor variable. This reflects the rank ordering of the predictor variables with respect to the role they play in accounting for variability on the response variable. A negative effect size indicates that an increase in the value of the predictor (e.g. an increased temperature) results in a lower probability of occurrence, whereas a positive effect size indicates that an increase in the predictor variable results in an increased probability of occurrence. The graph represents the confidence interval of the effect size per predictor variable. If the confidence interval crosses the zero line, then the association is considered non-significant. Thus, only predictor variables with a confidence interval below or above zero are considered to be of significant importance. The variable with either the highest or lowest effect size is the most important variable. The effect size plot below indicates that B12 is the most important predictor variable, and B17 the least important, but all predictor variables have a significant effect on the response variable. It is important to note that the effect size assessment relies on the condition that all of the predictor variables are independent of another. Correlation among predictor variables makes it difficult to determine how much variability in the response variable can be accounted for by any single predictor variable. This is why the VIP output also includes a correlation matrix (see below). This plot is included for the GLM and GAM algorithms. The AIC method measures the prediction performance in terms of information loss if a predictor variable would be excluded from the fitted model. It uses the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) information, which is a unique overall measure of discrepancies between a fitted model and the true model which generates the observed data. AIC is derived by minimizing the relative K-L information. For the machine learning algorithms ANN and GBM, the AIC approach is not applicable because there is no model log-likelihood information available. Therefore, we have included the variable importance function that is implemented in the biomod2 package. This function uses a machine-learning approach once the models are trained to randomize one of the variables in each permutation and calculate a correlation score between the standard prediction and the new prediction. This score is considered to give an estimation of the variable importance in the model. The higher the value, the more importance the predictor variable has on the model. A value of 0 assumes no influence of that predictor. Note that this method does not account for interactions between variables and should be considered more as an information tool for each model independently. For tree-based models, the variable importance is measured by the total decrease in node impurities from splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. For classification trees, this impurity is measured by the Gini index. The VIP output for the Classification Tree algorithm in the BCCVL includes the tree plot as well as the variable importance score plot. This matrix is currently only included for the GLM and Maxent algorithms. This matrix shows the linear correlation among predictor variables included in the model. This can be used to ensure that the included variables in the model are not too highly correlated which might bias the model outputs. For each combination of predictor variables the correlation is indicated as being either strongly negative (dark green), weakly negative (light green), weakly positive (light pink) or strongly positive (dark pink). The diagonal of the matrix represents the relationship of each variable with itself which is obviously always 1.","Sorry, we couldn't find the page you are looking for.Please use the search box in the upper right corner or contact us.

Patient activation is considered the most reliable indicator of patients’ ability to manage health autonomously. Only a few studies have tried to assess the role of psychosocial factors in promoting patient activation. A more systematic modeling of the psychosocial factors explaining the variance of patient activation is needed. To test the hypothesized effect of patient activation on medication adherence; to test the the hypothesized effects of positive emotions and of the quality of the patient/doctor relationship on patient activation; and to test the hypothesized mediating effect of Patient Health Engagement (PHE-model) in this pathway. This cross-sectional study involved 352 Italian-speaking adult chronic patients. The survey included measures of i) patient activation (Patient Activation Measure 13 –short form); ii) Patient Health Engagement model (Patient Health Engagement Scale); iii) patient adherence (4 item-Morinsky Medication Adherence Scale); iv) the quality of the patients’ emotional feelings (Manikin Self Assessment Scale); v) the quality of the patient/doctor relationship (Health Care Climate Questionnaire). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses proposed. According to the theoretical model we hypothesized, research results confirmed that patients’ activation significantly affects their reported medication adherence. Moreover, psychosocial factors, such as the patients’ quality of the emotional feelings and the quality of the patient/doctor relationship were demonstrated to be factors affecting the level of patient activation. Finally, the mediation effect of the Patient Health Engagement model was confirmed by the analysis. Consistently with the results of previous studies, these findings demonstrate that the Patient Health Engagement Model is a critical factor in enhancing the quality of care. The Patient Health Engagement Model might acts as a mechanism to increase patient activation and adherence. Copyright:  © 2017 Graffigna et al.

An increasing body of scientific research today examines the factors and interventions affecting patients’ ability to self-manage and adhere to treatment.[1,2] Patient activation is considered to be the most reliable indicator of the willingness and ability to manage health and care autonomously.[3–5] The patient activation theory has been developed by Hibbard and Mahoney.[2] It describes an incremental process, which patients undergo when becoming protagonists of their care management. Specifically, this theory is rooted in the concepts of self-efficacy [6,7] and locus of control, [8,9] and in the transtheoretical model of change.[10] It refers to “the individual’s knowledge, skill and confidence in managing his/her own health and care”[11]. Drawing on this theory, Hibbard and Mahoney [2] developed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), which is a 13-item Likert self-reported questionnaire. The PAM-13 is widely used to measure the level of empowerment and self-management of chronic care patients. [5] The scale features four levels of patient activation describing different levels of patients’ readiness to assume an active role in their care management. Previous studies have shown the role of patients’ activation in influencing their adherence to treatment prescriptions. [12,13] Moreover, studies have found that patients actively involved in their care plans are also more likely to trust their clinicians [14] and less likely to experience adverse clinical events and hospital readmissions.[15] Furthermore, making patients active in their healthcare is also recognized as a key strategy with which to make healthcare more sustainable by reducing healthcare-related costs.[16] Numerous studies have demonstrated empirically that patients more activated in their care are also more likely to enact preventive behavior such as having regular check-ups, screenings, and immunizations.[17–20] More highly activated people are also significantly more likely to enact healthy behaviors such as following a healthy diet and taking regular exercise. [21] Moreover, those who are more activated are more likely to avoid health-damaging behaviors like smoking and substance abuse.[22] In general, studies have demonstrated the association of a high level of patient activation with positive clinical outcomes in several populations across chronic conditions [23–27]. This has generated the hypothesis that the patient activation process, its antecedents, and its consequences on patient care, are disease-transcending instead of disease-specific. [28] A great deal of effort is being devoted to implementing programs and initiatives intended to improve patients’ activation as a crucial predictor of medication adherence and better healthcare utilization. But they often prove not to be effective.[28] The reason for this ineffectiveness is often attributed to the lack of personalization of patient activation interventions.[29] A further reason may relate to the lack of agreement on the factors associated with patient activation and which may promote it.[30] The variance empirically explained regarding the level of activation in patients with chronic illness is still low,[31] so that it is difficult to design interventions effective in promoting self-management. In particular, the vast majority of studies exploring the variables that may impact on patient activation are primarily related to extrinsic factors related to the patient condition. In this domain, studies have demonstrated the association between patient activation and socio-cultural characteristics of the individual patient such as gender, age, level of education[28,32] and level of income [12,33]. Other studies have demonstrated the association between patients’ activation and their clinical condition: such as type and year of diagnosis [28], type of treatment regimen [34], level of health literacy[35–37], and psychiatric and cognitive condition of the patient[38]. However, the results are often partial and contrasting, which impedes final consensus on the factors, which predict the patient activation level. Only few studies have sought to assess the role of psychological factors in influencing patient activation[24,35,39,40], although the level of patient activation may not be ascribable solely to external, contextual causes. In this regard, some studies have verified that patients’ health locus of control[41,42]–defined as the individual’s set of beliefs and motivation concerning self-determination of his/her health–is associated with patients’ level of activation.[13,40] Similarly, the perceived level of social support received from informal caregivers or the patient’s peers has been demonstrated to be a predictor of patient activation.[31] Other studies have argued that the emotional state of patients in a specific life moment may influence their ability to assume a proactive role in their care management [43]. These studies have shown that a higher level of patient activation is associated with lower depressive symptoms, although they have not demonstrated the causal relationship (and its direction) between these two variables (patient activation and depressive symptoms). Finally, some studies have explored the role of the perceived quality of the patient/doctor relationship in determining patients’ activation: in particular, a reference healthcare professional perceived as open to dialogue, emotionally supportive, and easily accessible has been demonstrated to be associated with a higher level of patient activation.[14,44] This preliminary scientific evidence on the psychological factors associated with patient activation is promising. They suggest that more personalized interventions aimed at improving patients’ self-management and adherence can be devised. However, only few of the studies currently available in the scientific arena have explored the causal relationship between these different factors and patient activation.[39,45,46] A more systematic modeling of the psychosocial factors causing patient activation is therefore needed. Furthermore, the concept of patient activation often overlaps with the one of patient engagement. However, systematic reviews of the scientific literature demonstrated that the two concepts are diverse and linked to different phenomena. Basing on previous studies, patients’ engagement refers to the ability of patients to give sense and to adjust to their disease and their actual care condition. It may play an important mediating role in the activation process and in patient adherence to treatment. In previous studies, we have explored how the experience of patient engagement emotionally develops in the care journey as a consequence of a complex sense-making process related to patients’ health status and perceived role in the healthcare journey. We have described this process in its four evolving phases (blackout, arousal, adhesion, eudaimonic project) and termed it the Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE-model).[44,47–50] This model highlights how patients emotionally elaborate and give sense their illness status and patients’ identity, and it may be considered a crucial precursor of their ability and willingness to play a more active role in self-management. A previous study has highlighted how PHE-model plays a mediating role in the activation of type-2 diabetes patients.[44] Based on these premises, we claim that the ability of the healthcare professional to legitimize the proactive role of patients in their healthcare might affect their reported adherence to medical treatments. This variable might also predict the level of patient activation. Furthermore, the quality of the emotional feelings experienced by patients in relation to their illness might impact on patient activation levels. Finally, we assume that the PHE-model—due to its ability to capture the psychological journey of patient engagement–may be a mediator of the impact of the quality of emotional feelings and of the perceived quality of the relationship with the healthcare professional on patient activation and on patient adherence (Fig 1). This is a path diagram describing the hypothesized effects of positive emotions and of the ability of the healthcare professionals to support patients’ autonomy on patient activation and medication adherence; it also describes the hypothesized mediating effect of patient engagement in this pathway.

The entire Research Now Panel covers a wide range of chronic diseases and comprises more than 6.5 million registered subjects worldwide. The panel provider screens subjects belonging to the Research Now Panel for their authenticity via digital fingerprint and geo-IP-validation. All Research Now’s panelists are profiled on the basis of their socio-demographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics. To ensure data reliability, the Research Now Panel is certified to be statistically representative of all the populations covered. For the specific purposes of this research, we randomly selected a sample of patients enrolled by the Research Now panel, according to the following pre-defined inclusion criteria: patients included in our study sample had to be Italian-speaking, affected by a chronic condition, aged over 18 years old, and of each gender. Patients with dementia, cognitive impairments, active psychiatric disorders, blindness, deafness, or insufficient Italian language skills to answer the questions meaningfully, or without informed consent, were excluded from this study. In order to be certain regarding our sample patients’ characteristics we asked them to confirm—before completing the study’s survey—previously collected by the Research Now Panel such as their demographics (i.e. gender, date and place of birth, ethnicity, nationality, educational level, place of residence) and clinical diagnosis. The sample included in our study is not a stratified and fully representative of the Italian chronic population but it was randomly selected in order to guarantee its probabilistic feature. However, in this study we did not seek a descriptive estimation of the variables under examination, rather we were interested in their associative relationship. Thus, we did not consider the full representativeness of the sample necessarily required. All participants provided written informed consent before being enrolled in the research. Initially, we randomly selected and enrolled a convenience sample of 500 patients according to the inclusion criteria established for this study. Only 352 returned the completed survey. Patients who did not complete the entire survey did not differ from the ones who provided all responses in terms of socio-demographic characteristics (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179865.t001 The survey was based on a structured self-administered online questionnaire (powered by the QUALTRICS online platform, https://www.qualtrics.com/). The Research Now Panel provider mailed the online link to the survey to the enrolled participants. The questionnaire developed by the Authors of this study included validated measures and ad hoc items. Following, a detailed description of the included measures: Data analysis was conducted in five steps. In the first step descriptive analyses were conducted, with particular reference to socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. In a second step of the analysis, the psychometric properties of the instruments were assessed in terms of reliability by using Cronbach’s Alpha for metric variables or Ordinal Alpha via Empirical Copula for ordinal variables [44]. A Cronbach’s or Ordinal Alpha via Empirical Copula, which was higher than 0.7 was considered acceptable. An evaluation of floor and ceiling effects for each items and a measure of skewness and kurtosis for the total scores of each scale were also performed in order to test Gaussian assumptions of next analyses. In a third step of analysis, Gender, Education, Age, Employment and Marital Status Differences on outcome variables (PAM-13 and MMAS-4) were investigated. For gender and age factors a t-test was conducted; for other factors a univariate Anova. In a fourth step of analysis, correlations between all the considered variables were calculated. Since every instrument produced a metric score, the linear correlation coefficient r was calculated and evaluated with a significance test. In the last step, a Structural Equation Model with observed variables using ML estimation method was implemented [45] in order to evaluate the relationships between the considered variables and to explore the theoretical model hypothesized (see the hypotheses stated above). Structural equation analysis was conducted to test the hypothesized relationships among variables, which are based on a theoretical model previously developed (Fig 1). In the model we considered HCCQ and SAM as exogenous variables, and mediator (PHE-S) and dependent variables (PAM-13, MMAS-4) as endogenous ones. The Goodness-of-fit indexes were examined through Chi square test, RMSEA, CFI and SRMR. Models with acceptable fit presented non-significant Chi square value, RMSEA < .08 CFI > .90 and SRMR < .08 [46]. The normed fit index (NFI), relative fit index (RFI), incremental fit index (IFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) were used as incremental fit measures. An incremental fit measure value > 0.9 indicated a `good' fit for the model. Parsimonious normed-of-fit index (PNFI) and parsimonious comparative fit index (PCFI) were used as parsimonious fit measures. A value > 0.05 was considered reasonable for a good model fit. To improve the goodness-of-fit, modification indices were considered. Analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 23.0. The study received approval from the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Ethics Committee. Patients consented to participate in the study, and they were allowed to withdraw from the study whenever they wanted. The data were collected anonymously and analyzed in aggregated form. Overall, 500 patients were invited to participate in the study and completely answered the questionnaire for the analysis. 352 patients (159 female) completed the survey, mean age 53.1 (±15.1), and years with mean disease duration of almost 12 years. Table 1 lists the socio-demographic, clinical and psychometric characteristics of the sample. Mean, standard deviation (unless otherwise indicated) and a suitable reliability index (Cronbach Alpha or Ordinal Alpha via Empirical Copula) are reported for all the psychometric measures considered. All the psychometric measures presented a good or excellent reliability, with a Cronbach or Ordinal Alpha ranging from .77 to .93. No floor and ceiling effects were detected. Asymmetry and Kurtosis indices were in the acceptable limits [-1; + 1]. A t-test was performed to determine whether there were significant differences by gender and age (under or over 65 years) related to the outcome variables PAM-13 and MMAS-4. An univariate Anova was performed to investigate differences related to the outcome variables for educational, employment and marital status. The results are reported in Table 2. Socio-demo characteristics did not impact on PAM-13 scores, while age and employment status had a significant effect on MMAS-4. In particular, older and retired subjects presented a lower level of treatment adherence. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179865.t002 Table 3 reports linear correlation coefficients between the psychometric variables considered. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179865.t003 HCCQ presented a significant correlation with all the measures except SAM: a positive correlation with PHE-S and PAM-13 and a negative correlation with MMAS-4 were detected. SAM had a significant positive correlation with MMAS-4, and a negative correlation with PHE-S and PAM-13. PHE-S showed a significant direct correlation with HCCQ and PAM-13, and a negative correlation with SAM and with MMAS-4. PAM-13 had a significant direct correlation with all the measures except SAM and MMAS-4. Considering the hypotheses to be tested in the study and the correlations between the psychometric measures detected, a Structural Equation Model was implemented to verify associations and relationship between the variables. Relationships among patients' perceptions of the ability of the healthcare professionals to support their autonomy (HCCQ), negative patients’ emotions (SAM), patients’ engagement (PHE-S), patients’ activation (PAM-13) and medication adherence (MMAS-4) were tested. Fig 2 shows the explanatory model of the hypotheses that we wanted to verify. Circles indicate unobserved latent variables, while rectangles represent observed variables. Significant paths with their estimated parameter are shown by solid lines. Standardized path coefficients are presented at the midpoint of the unidirectional arrow paths. Not significant paths are shown by dashed lines. Circles indicate unobserved latent variables, while rectangles represent observed variables.

Not significant paths are shown by dashed lines. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179865.g002 The hypotheses were verified. Evaluation of the modification indexes did not suggest any change to the structure of the model. The model presented an acceptable goodness-of-fit. Chi square test was not significant (χ2(1) = 1.9, p = .17). All goodness of fit indexes were satisfactory (RMSEA = 0.052, CFI = 0.996, SRMR = 0.040). The estimated paths were significant (p < .001). The Adjusted Goodness-of-fit (AGFI) was superior to .90 (AGFI = 0.967). NFI = 0.984, RFI = 0.940, IFI = 0.992, TLI = 0.960 as incremental fit measures, and PNFI = 0.099, PCFI = 0.100 as parsimonious fit measures confirmed the adequacy and consistency of the model. Some path coefficients have not been significant. Table 4 reports all standardized path coefficients, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals (via percentile bootstrap method) and p-value. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179865.t004 In addition to overall model fit, path coefficients also provide information regarding the direct and indirect effects. The direction of the arrow in Fig 2 implies the flow of the causal effect and the impact of one variable on another. Standardized path coefficients (i.e., the direct effect of a variable on the other) varied between-1 and +1 and could be interpreted in the same way as standardized multiple regression coefficients, indicating the amount of standard deviations a dependent variable will change, per standard deviation increase in the predictor Variable. Table 5 shows the standardized total, direct and indirect effects of each variable (estimates and standard errors) on the dependent variable MMAS-4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179865.t005 The purpose of the analysis reported by this study was to contribute to the scholarly debate on the determinants of patient activation. In particular, given the crucial role that the level of patient activation plays in promoting the better quality and effectiveness of healthcare, the first objective was to verify the association between PAM-13 level and patients’ reported adherence to treatment. Consistently with other previous studies [64,65], our results confirmed this relationship by demonstrating that patients’ activation is associated to their reported treatment adherence. This result is relevant to clinical practice because it confirms the importance of allocating time and effort to promoting patients’ empowerment and activation in order to assure their ability to self-manage and effectively adhere to treatment. In this study we verified the theoretical hypothesis and the hypnotized relationships among the variables included in our conceptual model. Structural equation analysis allows testing hypotesized relationships among variables, which are based on a theoretical model previously developed. Further research should be conducted in order to increase evidences about the direction of the hypotesized relationships among the variables. Indeed, reverse causality could be possible and should be tested by conducting longitudinal research design. For instance, further studies could be aimed at exploring the hypothesis that being empowered in their medical care cause patient to feel more positive in general and to experience higher quality patient-doctor relationships. Furthermore, the analysis sought to disentangle the roles of psychosocial variables, such as positive emotion and perceived quality of the doctor/patient relationship, in determining the level of patients’ activation. We claimed that not only extrinsic factors such as patients’ demographic characteristics and their disease conditions might influence their level of activation. In this framework, we primarily explored the role of positive emotional feelings in affecting patient activation, on the assumption that the psychological wellness of patients and their ability to adapt positively to their illness may be an antecedent of their ability to self-manage and assume an active role in the healthcare journey. This relationship was verified by confirming the role of the patients’ positive emotional state in affecting patient activation. Furthermore, we explored the predictor role of the perceived quality of the patient/doctor relationship in sustaining patient activation. Also this relationship was verified, thus confirming the findings of previous studies [44,66–68]. In particular, the ability of healthcare professionals to motivate patients towards self-management and treatment adherence is important in this process; but especially so are their recognition and acceptance of the patients’ active role in the care journey. This study has demonstrated that the healthcare professional’s ability to make the patient autonomous in the care journey predicts the ability of patients to adopt a proactive role in the healthcare experience and to adhere to treatment [66,67,69]. This result suggests interesting further investigation on how the role of healthcare professionals and their attitudes to engagement are crucial assets with which to achieve activation.[70–75,68,67] Attitudes not given for granted since the concept of patient activation and engagement put into question the need of revisiting traditional power dynamics in the doctor-patients relationships [76,77]. A further purpose of our analysis was to explore the role of PHE-model in explaining patient activation. Particularly we proposed to consider Patient Health Engagement such as the patients’ psychological elaboration of their healthcare experience. In this study we explored the role of PHE-model in mediating the impact of positive emotions and the perceived quality of the doctor-patient relationship on the level of patient activation and medication adherence. Also this relationship was verified, confirming that PHE-model is a crucial factor in their ability to assume an active role in self-management and treatment adherence. In previous studies, we argued that PHE-model must be conceived as a complex psychological process of adjustment to illness, which evolves in time and which is a function of several contextual factors [47]. In particular, engaging in the healthcare journey means becoming able not only to accept the diagnosis and its consequences for one’s health condition and lifestyle but also to understand one’s potential (starring) role in the care process. As a consequence, also the patient’s ability to become proactive in self-management and treatment adherence, thus improving his/her level of activation, is the result of a complex psychological elaboration and adjustment to the disease (and to the new”role patient”). Activation, therefore, may not be conceived as an ‘on/off’ state; it is determined by the developmental change in the patient’s identity on a complex journey of engagement. At the beginning of the care pathway, in fact, patients may be too overwhelmed and shocked (the ‘blackout’ phase in the PHE Model [50,78–80] to be able to assume an active role in the care process. In this phase patients tend to be passive and to delegate all decisions and actions concerning their care to the reference healthcare professionals. Activation or promotion of patient empowerment may be difficult and even counterproductive in this phase because the patient would reject medical attempts to make him or her autonomous. With time, clinical support and education, the patient may then evolve in his/her adjustment to the disease and the care management. S/he moves to the state of psychological ‘alert’: here the patient is over-sensitized and worried about his/her ill body, and hyper-vigilant on signs and symptoms that may occur. In this phase, the patient is disorganized in his/her activation in a way likely to be dysfunctional for the clinical relationship and the care management. In this phase the patient is ‘disease centered’ because his/her psychological energy and cognitive resources are all focused on the disease, but s/he may be disorganized and over-demanding in his/her navigation of the healthcare system. As their psychological adjustment evolves, patients acquire better mastery of their illness condition and improved awareness of their important role in determining the effectiveness of their care (‘adhesion’ phase). In this psychological phase, patients become ‘good patients’, with an acceptable literacy about their disease and its treatment and able to comply with the medical prescriptions. Although they are activated, they are not autonomous in self-management because they are still very reliant on their reference healthcare professional, whom they tend to over-consult upon even minimum changes in their everyday and care routines. Patients in this state tend to be still rather unsure about their role in self-determining the care journey and still reluctant to be autonomous in self-management. A phase of full engagement then follows. Patients are completely aware of their health and care conditions, and also able to make satisfactory life plans despite the disease. According to the PHE-Model these patients are in a state of Eudaimonic Project. They have fully mastered their patient identity and agreed to play an active and fulfilling role in the care journey. But they have also become able to perceive themselves as persons, and not just as patients afflicted by a disease and by medical treatments. These patients have determined that ‘they are not their disease’, and this new psychological awareness foster energy, positive emotions and self-confidence in them. Patients in this phase are fully aware that they are co-authors of their health. They accept that the effectiveness of care is also dependent on their motivation and determination to fight the disease and improve their quality of life. These fully engaged patients are well able to navigate the healthcare system and adhere to the medical prescription. They are also able to enact effective shared decision–making. [66,67,81,82]. Moreover, they become apostles of engagement practices, providing crucial testimony for other patients affected by the same disease but at the beginning of their engagement journey. These patients are fully activated and empowered towards their medical journey. Concerning this study’s limitations, the heterogeneity of the diseases suffered by the patients in our sample may be regarded as a weakness. Furthermore, although the sample analyzed by our research was not stratified and fully representative of the Italian chronic population, it was randomly selected in order to guarantee its probabilistic nature. We used it only to explore the relationships among the variables under analysis (i.e. for associative purposes, not for descriptive estimation of their dimensions): given these considerations, full representativeness was not necessarily required. Moreover, in this study we explored formal mediation among the included variables. This is basically an observational study with no experimental manipulation of the independent variables involved in the conceptual model under investigation. Indeed, it is possible that several of the relationships between the variables included in the analysis are actually operating in a reverse manner from the hypothesized relationships (i.e., perhaps adherence increases patient activation through feeling the positive benefits of treatment) and the cross-sectional nature of the data preclude determining this. For these reasons, further longitudinal studies should be conducted to verify a causal relationship among the variables. Furthermore, although the sample included in our study is not a stratified and fully representative of the Italian chronic population, it was randomly selected in order to guarantee its probabilistic feature. We used it only to explore the relationships of the variables under analysis (i.e. for associative purposes and not for a descriptive estimation of their dimensions): based on these considerations full representativeness is not necessarily required [83]. The PHE-model, measured in this study with the PHE-scale, casts light on possible psychological roots of patient motivation to self-management. The role the PHE-model in determining patient activation appears to us particularly promising for future research and clinical practice. PHE-model may be considered as lever to foster patients’ activation and—thus—patients’ adherence to treatments [84,85]. Our data suggest a cluster of factors associated with patient activation: mainly the level of patients’ elaboration of their disease, but also the quality of the patient/doctor relationship and positive emotional attitudes towards the health conditions [86]. If effective interventions to improve patient activation are to be developed, those targeting patients with lower levels of PHE-model should be prioritized [87]. Thanks for your feedback.

the most abundant dissolved salt in ocean water is,"Seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater. However, the ratios of solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater contains about 2.8 times more bicarbonate than river water based on molarity, the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water. Bicarbonate ions also constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% of all seawater ions. Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes; sodium and chloride have very long residence times, while calcium (vital for carbonate formation) tends to precipitate much more quickly. The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate and calcium. Its osmolarity is about 1000 mOsm / l.","my.chemeurope.com With an accout for my.chemeurope.com you can always see everything at a glance – and you can configure your own website and individual newsletter.

On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of ~3.5%, or 35 parts per thousand. This means that every 1 kg of seawater has approximately 35 grams of dissolved salts (mostly, but not entirely, the ions of sodium chloride: Na+, Cl-). The average density of seawater at the surface of the ocean is 1.025 g/mL; seawater is denser than fresh water (which reaches a maximum density of 1.000 g/mL at a temperature of 4°C) because of the added weight of the salts and electrostriction.[1] The freezing point of sea water decreases with increasing salinity and is about  -2°C (28.4°F) at 35 parts per thousand. [2] Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 3.1% and 3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths or near melting glaciers, seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and river inflow, and confined circulation result in the formation of unusually salty seawater. The salinity in isolated seas and salt-water lakes (for example, the Dead Sea) can be considerably greater. The density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg·m-3, depending on the temperature and salinity.  Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1050 kg·m-3 or higher.  Seawater pH is limited to the range 7.5 to 8.4.  The speed of sound in seawater is about 1500 m·s-1, and varies with water temperature and pressure. Seawater is more enriched in dissolved ions of all types than fresh water.[3]  However, the ratios of various solutes differ dramatically.  For instance, although seawater is ~2.8 times more enriched with bicarbonate than river water based on molarity, the  percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water; bicarbonate ions constitute 48% of river water solutes, but only 0.41% of all seawater ions.[3][4]  Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes;  sodium and chlorine have very long residence times, while calcium (vital for carbonate formation) tends to precipitate out much more quickly.[4] Scientific theories behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir Edmond Halley in 1715, who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers, having been leached out of the ground by rainfall runoff. Upon reaching the ocean, these salts would be retained and concentrated as the process of evaporation (see Hydrologic cycle) removed the water. Halley noted that of the small number of lakes in the world without ocean outlets (such as the Dead Sea and the Caspian Sea, see endorheic basin), most have high salt content. Halley termed this process ""continental weathering"". Halley's theory is partly correct. In addition, sodium was leached out of the ocean floor when the oceans first formed. The presence of the other dominant ion of salt, chloride, results from ""outgassing"" of chloride (as hydrochloric acid) with other gases from Earth's interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt. Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/tectonic system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include evaporite deposits, pore water burial, and reactions with seafloor basalts[6] Since the ocean's creation, sodium is no longer leached out of the ocean floor, but instead is captured in sedimentary layers covering the bed of the ocean. One theory is that plate tectonics result in salt being forced under the continental land masses, where it is again slowly leached to the surface. Even on a ship or island in the middle of the ocean, there can be a ""shortage of water"" meaning a shortage of fresh water. This is described famously by a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: Seawater can be turned into drinkable (potable) water by one of a number of desalination processes, or by diluting it with fresh water to reduce the salinity.  Almost all large ocean-going vessels create fresh water from seawater using vacuum evaporators, flash evaporators or by the use of reverse osmosis. Otherwise, seawater should not be drunk because of its high salt content.  In the long run, more water must be expended to eliminate the salt (through excretion in urine) than the amount of water that is gained from drinking the seawater itself. [7] Accidentally consuming small quantities of seawater is not harmful. However some people cling to a persistent and incorrect belief that humans can survive at sea by drinking only seawater. This misconception probably originated from questionable reports claiming that the French physician Alain Bombard survived an ocean crossing using only seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. The amount of sodium chloride in human blood and in urine is always kept within a very narrow range of 9 g per L (0.9% by weight). Drinking seawater (which contains about 3.5% ions of dissolved sodium chloride) temporarily increases the concentration of sodium chloride in the blood, so the only way to excrete the excess sodium chloride in the urine is by sacrificing internal water from cells.  The cells eventually give so much water to try to dilute the salt that they die from dehydration, quickly followed by organs and eventually the organism.

On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, or 0.600 M) This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/l. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/l at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F).[1] The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured −2.6 °C (27.3 °F).[2] Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4.[3] However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.[4] Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 3.1% and 3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths or near melting glaciers, seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and river inflow, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water (for example, the Dead Sea) can be considerably greater still. The density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg/m3, depending on the temperature and salinity. Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1050 kg/m3 or higher. Seawater pH is limited to the range 7.5 to 8.4. The speed of sound in seawater is about 1,500 m/s, and varies with water temperature, salinity, and pressure. Seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater.[8] However, the ratios of solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater contains about 2.8 times more bicarbonate than river water based on molarity, the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water. Bicarbonate ions also constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% of all seawater ions.[8][9] Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes; sodium and chlorine have very long residence times, while calcium (vital for carbonate formation) tends to precipitate much more quickly.[9] The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate and calcium.[10] Its osmolarity is about 1000 mOsm/l.[11] Small amounts of other substances are found including amino acids at concentrations up to 2 micrograms of Nitrogen atoms per liter,[12] which are thought to have played a key role in the origin of life. Research in 1957 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography sampled water in both pelagic and neritic locations in the Pacific Ocean. Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used, the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures. These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates, selective effects of the culture media, and the presence of inactive cells. A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline, but not by direct microscopic observation. Large numbers of spirilli-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation. The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields.[13] In the 1990s, improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of DNA, enabled researchers taking part in the Census of Marine Life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers. This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected, so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species. Dr. Mitchell Sogin from the Marine Biological Laboratory feels that ""the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million.""[14] Bacteria are found at all depths in the water column, as well as in the sediments, some being aerobic, others anaerobic. Most are free-swimming, but some exist as symbionts within other organisms – examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria. Cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes, enabling the development of stromatolites and oxygen in the atmosphere. Some bacteria interact with diatoms, and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean. One anaerobic species, Thiomargarita namibiensis, plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulphide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast, and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the Benguela Current upwelling zone, eventually falling to the seafloor. Bacteria-like Archaea surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments, such as the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Vibrio spp. survive in a pH range of 7.3 to 10.6, while some species will grow only at pH 10 to 10.6.[15] Archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean's biomass, clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes.[16] In 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of Archaea that breaks down methane, an important greenhouse gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming.[17] Some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor, influencing seawater chemistry. Oil spills, and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity, as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life. The protist dinoflagellates may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or red tides, often after human-caused pollution. The process may produce metabolites known as biotoxins, which move along the ocean food chain, tainting higher-order animal consumers. Pandoravirus salinus, a species of very large virus, with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species, was discovered in 2013. Like the other very large viruses Mimivirus and Megavirus, Pandoravirus infects amoebas, but its genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of Megavirus, and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure. In 2013 researchers from Aberdeen University announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches, hoping to find ""the next generation"" of antibiotics, anticipating an ""antibiotic apocalypse"" with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs. The EU-funded research will start in the Atacama Trench and then move on to search trenches off New Zealand and Antarctica.[18] Scientific theories behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir Edmond Halley in 1715, who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground. Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see Hydrologic cycle.) Halley noted that most lakes that don't have ocean outlets (such as the Dead Sea and the Caspian Sea, see endorheic basin), have high salt content. Halley termed this process ""continental weathering"". Halley's theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt's other dominant ion, chloride, results from outgassing of chloride (as hydrochloric acid) with other gases from Earth's interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt. Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/tectonic system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include evaporite deposits, pure water burial, and reactions with seafloor basalts.[9]:133 Climate change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing acidity, reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in mercury and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity. Concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades, with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources.[22] Accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful, especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water. However, drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive; more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt (via urine) than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself.[23] The renal system actively regulates sodium chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g/L (0.9% by weight). In most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5%, far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process. A point frequently overlooked , in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations (2%), is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations, so that there is no benefit in drinking such water. Drinking seawater temporarily increases blood's NaCl concentration. This signals the kidney to excrete sodium, but seawater's sodium concentration is above the kidney's maximum concentrating ability. Eventually the blood's sodium concentration rises to toxic levels, removing water from cells and interfering with nerve conduction, ultimately producing fatal seizure and cardiac arrhythmia. Survival manuals consistently advise against drinking seawater.[24] A summary of 163 life raft voyages estimated the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not. The effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated.[25] The temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water, and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking. This frustration was described famously by a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: Although humans cannot survive on seawater, some people claim that up to two cups a day, mixed with fresh water in a 2:3 ratio, produces no ill effect. The French physician Alain Bombard survived an ocean crossing in a small Zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat, which contains about 40 percent water (like most living tissues), as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. His findings were challenged, but an alternative explanation was not given. In his 1948 book, Kon-Tiki, Thor Heyerdahl reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2:3 ratio during the 1947 expedition.[26] A few years later, another adventurer, William Willis, claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply.[27] During the 18th Century, Richard Russell advocated the practice's medical use in the UK, and René Quinton expanded the advocation of the practice other countries, notably France, in the 20th century. Currently, the practice is widely used in Nicaragua and other countries, supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries. ASTM International has an international standard for artificial seawater: ASTM D1141-98 (Original Standard ASTM D1141-52). It is used in many research testing labs as a reproducible solution for seawater such as tests on corrosion, oil contamination, and detergency evaluation.[29]",,,,,,,,
which rosary mysteries on which days of the week,"A standard 15 Mysteries of the Rosary, based on the long-standing custom, was established by Pope Pius V during the 16th century, grouping the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. During 2002 Pope John Paul II said that it is fitting that a new set of five be added, termed the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. The Glorious mysteries are said on Sunday and Wednesday, the Joyful on Monday and Saturday, the Sorrowful on Tuesday and Friday, and the Luminous Mysteries are said on Thursday. Usually five decades are recited in a session.","Abbess – the legal head and spiritual mother of a monastery. Abbot – the legal head and spiritual father of a monastery. Acolyte – anyone who performs ceremonial duties such as lighting altar candles, or serving at Mass. The term is also used for one who has been inducted into a particular liturgical ministry, even when not performing those duties. This is no longer gender specific to males only. Actual Grace – Spontaneous freely given act of divine love/mercy given to us because God desires us to have it because he sees we need it. Advent – c/f  Liturgical Seasons below. Ad Limina Visits — visit by diocesan bishops to the Holy See, usually every five years. The state of the Dioceses and the Church are discussed with the Holy Father. Altar –  a structure upon which offerings/sacrifices and worship are made for religious purposes. They are usually found at shrines, temples, churches, chapels, oratories and other places of worship. In the history of religious persecution they were also called Mass rocks. Ambo or Lectern – (from the Latin legere, “to read”), is a reading desk, with a slanted top, on which documents or books are placed as support for reading aloud, as in a scripture reading, lecture, or sermon. Let us pray. Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts; that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His resurrection. Through the same Christ, our Lord. Amen. Anointing of the sick – is a Sacramental ritual of healing appropriate not only for physical but also for mental and spiritual sickness. It is available to all seriously sick people. Annulment – a Declaration of Nullity is ‘Judgement’ of a church court, confirmed by an appellate court, that an ‘apparent marriage’ was not valid from the start because something was lacking: full knowledge and consent by both parties, freedom from force or grave fear, or some other factor needed for a valid marriage. “Putative” (meaning apparent or seeming) is a key word in the entire process: It refers to a marriage in which at least one party acted in good faith, believing it was valid at the time it took place. Children from a putative marriage are considered legitimate even if the marriage is later ruled to be invalid. This has been a source of one of the major popular misunderstandings of annulments; namely, that an annulment somehow makes the children of that union illegitimate. Church law explicitly rejects this interpretation, saying that children of a putative marriage are legitimate even if the marriage is later judged to be invalid. Apostolic administrator – a prelate appointed by the Pope to serve as the ordinary for an apostolic administration. Apostolic Blessing – a blessing that follows the anointing of a person who may be close to death.It takes the form of a diologue with the dying person and those present and offers the consolation of God’s constant love for humanity. It begins with asking God’s peace on the household. It affirms the tradition of passing from life through death to the promise of a fuller life with God. The person involved draws strength and grace for their journey.c/f Anointing Apostolic Chancery –  a dicastery or department of the Roman Curia. The chief official was the Cardinal Chancellor of Holy Roman Church. In 1973 ts functions were transferred to the Secretariat of State in Rome. Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland, Dr. Charles Brown –(officially known as an Apostolic nuncio also known as a papal nuncio) is the title for an ecclesiastical diplomat, being an envoy or permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or international organization. Apostolic prefect or prefect apostolic –  is a priest who heads what is known as an apostolic prefecture, a missionary area where the Catholic Church is not yet sufficiently developed to have it made a diocese.The usual sequence of development is: mission, prefecture, vicariate, diocese. Apostolic succession: Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession. Apostolic vicariate: a form of territorial jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church established in missionary regions and countries where a diocese has not yet been established. Apse – the apse (from Latin absis: “arch, vault”  is a semicircular recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome which stands at the liturgical east end of the church (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical. (The image is that of San Clemente Basilica, Rome. The dome is the classic symbol of Heaven as its shape imitates the dome of the sky. It is fitting as the Sanctuary is often thought of as a little piece of Heaven). Archbishop — the bishop of an archdiocese, with limited jurisdiction over his suffragan sees; a titular and largely honorary designation granted to certain bishops, often Nuncios and other members of the Holy See diplomatic corps. Ascension of Jesus (anglicized from the Vulgate Latin Acts 1:9-11 section title: Ascensio Iesu) is the Christian teaching found in the New Testament that the resurrected Jesus was taken up to Heaven in his resurrected body, in the presence of eleven of his apostles, occurring 40 days after the resurrection. Auxiliary bishop –  an additional bishop assigned to a diocese because of the size or complexity of said diocese. Baptism – The first and basic Christian sacrament (C/f Sacrament below) of initiation or admission and adoption, almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally. Jesus himself was reported baptised by John the Baptist in the Jordan river in the early chapters gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. Baptism is also called christening a word often reserved for the baptism of infants. The usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the candidate to be immersed, either totally (submerged completely under the water) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her). Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead, a method called affusion. Martyrdom was accepted early in Church history as “baptism by/of blood”, enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. It is commonly referred to as: baptism of desire.’ Baptism of Jesus – This marks the beginning of Jesus’ public ministry and is described in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.  The Baptism of Jesus is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being the Transfiguration,  Crucifixion, ,Resurrection and Ascension. Baptismal Font –  is an article of church furniture used in the administration of the sacrament of Baptism. The fonts are intended for baptisms using a non-immersion method, such as aspersion or affusion. They  are often placed at or near the entrance to the main body of the church to remind believers of their baptism as they enter the church to worship, since the rite of baptism served as their initiation into the Church. Beatification – (from Latin beatus, “blessed” and facere, “to make”) is a recognition accorded by the Catholic Church of a dead person’s entrance into Heaven and capacity to intercede on behalf of individuals who pray in his or her name. ‘Blesseds’ are celebrated regionally not universally. It is the second stage of a three part eccesiastical process. Stage one is to pronounce a deceased holy person, ‘venerable’. Stage two is to announce them ‘blessed’. The third, final stage is canonisation after which we call them ‘saint’. In the early church this was often done by acclamation of the faithful. Bible – also referred to as The Good Book, The Holy Book, Scriptures, Holy Writ,  and The Word of God. The name bible comes from the Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, a collection of texts sacred to Judaism and Christianity, written at different times by different authors in different locations. The basic division of the 73 book Bible is into the Old and New Testaments. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, consisting of narratives, (Gospels and Acts) letters, (e.g. Ss Peter and Paul, and some apocalyptic writings (e.g. St John). Jews and Christians consider the books of the Bible to be a product of divine inspiration or an authoritative record of the relationship between God and His people. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. It has estimated annual sales of 100 million copies, and has been a major influence on literature and history, especially in the western World. General Epistles : James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation. Bishop – an ordained minister who holds the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders and is responsible for teaching the Catholic faith and ruling the Church in his assigned jurisdiction. Catholics trace the origins of the office of  bishop to the apostles, who it is believed were endowed with a special charism by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. We believe this special charism has been transmitted through an unbroken succession from the Apostles by the laying-on of hands in the sacrament of Holy Orders.[ Bishop Emeritus –  (or Archbishop emeritus or Pope emeritus) — an honorary title given to a retired bishop, archbishop or pope. Broadcast Mass on Internet/T.V. – c/f  Mass on Internet/TV. below Brother— a lay member of a Catholic religious institute in which they promise public vows and lead a life in common. Cardinal – a senior ecclesiastical leader, an ecclesiastical prince, and usually (now always for those created when still within the voting age-range) an ordained bishop of the Church. The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the College of Cardinals. A cardinal’s primary duty is electing the pope when the post becomes vacant. During the ‘sede vacante’ (the period between a pope’s death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. c/f College of Cardinals below Cardinal Vicar –  a title commonly given to the vicar general of the Diocese of Rome for the portion of the diocese within Italy. The official title, is “Vicar General of His Holiness”. The Pope is officially and fundamentally the Bishop of Rome and as such appoints the Cardinal Vicar with ordinary power to help with the spiritual administration of his diocese. Catholic Charismatic Renewal – a spiritual movement within the Catholic Church that incorporates aspects of both Catholic and charismatic practice. It places an emphasis on having a personal relationship with Jesus and expressing the gifts of the Spirit. Parishes that practice charismatic worship usually hold prayer meetings outside of Mass and feature such gifts as prophecy, faith healing, and glossolalia (speaking in tongues). Charismatic worship is sometimes described as praying with uplifted hands during spoken prayers and songs and audible praying in tongues. They go on to say that what distinguishes a charismatic Catholic church from a traditional one is their surrender to Jesus in all parts of life, obedience to both the Gospel and the Catholic teachings, and friendships centred on Jesus. Catechism of the Catholic Church – an official catechism promulgated for the Catholic Church summing up the beliefs of the Catholic faithful. Charity – the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God. St Paul held it as “the greatest of the virtues.” c/f 1 Cor 13. Chaplain of His Holiness – a priest to whom the Pope has granted this title. They are addressed as Monsignor. Chalice – (from Latin calix, mug, borrowed from Greek kalyx, shell, husk) is a goblet or footed cup intended to hold a drink. In general religious terms, it is intended for drinking during a religious ceremony. In the Catholic Church it is a standing cup used to hold sacramental wine during the Eucharist (also called the Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion). Chalices are often made of precious metal, and they are sometimes richly enamelled and jewelled. Child of Prague – a 16th-century Roman Catholic wax-coated wooden statue of child Jesus holding a ‘globus cruciger’, located in the Discalced Carmelite Church of Our Lady Victorious in Malá Strana, Prague, Czech Republic.The globus cruciger (Latin, “cross-bearing orb”), an orb topped  by a cross (Latin, crux), has been a Christian symbol of authority since the Middle Ages. The cross represents Christ’s dominion over the orb of the world, and held in the hand of an earthly ruler. In the iconography of Western art, when Christ himself holds the globe, he is called Salvator Mundi, the Saviour of the World. The minature Infant Jesus of Prague statue is a domestic adaptation of this tradition. Many other traditions have developed around the domestic statue version. E.g.  A small well- worn version of the statue is placed outside to plead for ‘good’ (suitable for my needs) weather on a particular day – please note, this is a tradition not a matter of faith!) Child Protection Policy – the Irish church child protection policy or the Catholic Church in Ireland: ‘Our Children, Our Church’, is published by the Irish Episcopal Conference, the Conference of Religious of Ireland and the Irish Missionary Union. It can be viewed online on the Irish Catholic Bishop’s conference website c/f www.safeguarding.ie and all religious orders’ websites or in all public church buildings that include services with/for children. c/f safeguarding( below) Christianity  – an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ as presented in the New Testament. Christianity is the world’s largest religion, with over 2.4 billion adherents, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the saviour of humanity whose coming as Christ or the Messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament. The name Christians was first given to the followers of Jesus in Antioch in St Paul’s time. Christian theology is expressed in ecumenical creeds. These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, and was resurrected from the dead, in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins. The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven, where he reigns with God the Father, and that he will return to judge the living and dead and grant eternal life to his followers. His ministry, crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as “the gospel”, meaning “good news”. The term gospel (Good News) also refers to written accounts of Jesus’s life and teaching, four of which by Ss Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Christian Community, Movement for Renewal, Ireland – brings together individuals in its communities who seek to become Christians in a form appropriate for our time. In the center of religious life in The Christian Community is the new service of worship, the Act of Consecration of Man. The Christian Community represents a worldview that sees the Deed of Christ as the decisive and most important event in human history. It is one of the most recent and fastest going religious groups in Ireland. Code of Canon Law 1917 – or CIC from its latin name ((Codex Iuris Canonici) The 1917 Code is also referred to as the Pio-Benedictine Code and was the first official comprehensive codification of Latin canon law. It was promulgated on 27 May 1917 and took legal effect on 19 May 1918. It was in force until the 1983 Code of Canon Law took legal effect and abrogated it on 27 November 1983. It has been described as “the greatest revolution in canon law since the time of Gratian” (1150s AD). c/f Canon Law (above) Code of Canon Law 1983 – is the “fundamental body of ecclesiastical laws for the Latin Church”. It is the second and current comprehensive codification of canonical legislation for the Latin Church sui juris of the Catholic Church. It was promulgated on 25 January 1983 by John Paul II and took legal effect on the First Sunday of Advent (27 November) 1983. It replaced the 1917 Code of Canon Law, promulgated by Benedict XV on 27 May 1917.  c/f Canon Law (above) College of Cardinals- is the body of all cardinals of the Catholic Church. A function of the college is to advise the pope about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary consistory or council. It convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a papal conclave to elect a successor but is then restricted to eligible Cardinals under the age limit, which was set for the first time in 1970 by Pope Paul VI at 80.The college has no ruling power except during the ‘sede vacante’ (papal vacancy) period. Historically, cardinals were the clergy serving parishes of the city of Rome under its bishop, the Pope. Communion – comes from the latin communio at one or in one.  It is often used, in catholic circles, to indicate the consecrated species of bread and wine consecrated into the Body and Blood of the Lord. ( c/f: below for full communion, Mass , Eucharist and in communion). In other Christian denominations it often refers to a service of Divine worship. Communion Rite –or Communion Service consists of the priest/deacon introducing the communal recitation or singing of the “Lord’s Prayer” (“Pater noster” or “Our Father”). He follows this up with a prayer and the people respond with the doxology. The sign of peace is exchanged and then the “Lamb of God” (“Agnus Dei” in Latin), The priest/deacon then presents the previously consecrated bread to the congregation, saying: “Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.” Then all repeat: “Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.”  Communion is distributed to the people. After some time for silent prayer, A formal prayer after Communion is then said, hymn sung, and the congregation is dismissed. Communion of Saints – refers to the doctrine of the communion of saints is based on 1 Cor. 12  and refer to Christians, who, whatever their personal sanctity as individuals, are called holy because they are consecrated to God and Christ. It refers to all persons, living and the dead, those on earth, in heaven, and, for those who are in that state of purification. They are all part of a single “mystical body”, with Christ as the head, in which each member contributes to the good of all and shares in the welfare of all. Confirmation is seen as a sacrament that seals the covenant created in Baptism. It renders the bond with the Church more perfect” because, while a baptized person is already a member, reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace”. In the Eastern churches it is conferred immediately after baptism. In the Western churches this practice is followed when adults are baptized, but in the case of infants not in danger of death it is administered, ordinarily by a bishop, only when the child reaches the age of reason or early adolescence. Among those Catholics who practice teen-aged confirmation, the practice may be perceived, secondarily, as a “coming of age” rite. Congregation – is used in four distinct senses, to mean a type of department in the Roman Curia, a type of religious institute, or some groups of Augustinian, Benedictine, and Cistercian houses, and a gathering of the faithful in church. In the Roman Curia it refers to the highest-ranking departments of the Roman Curia. Lower-ranking departments include pontifical councils, pontifical commissions, tribunals, and offices. The 1917 Code of Canon Law the name “religious order” is reserved for institutes in which the vows were solemn, and used the term “religious congregation” or simply “congregation” for those with simple vows. The current Code of Canon Law, which came into force in 1983, maintains the distinction between solemn and simple vows, but no longer makes any distinction between their juridical effects, including the distinction between “orders” and “congregations”. It has accordingly dropped the language of the 1917 code and uses the single term “religious institute to designate all such institutes of consecrated life alike. Consecrated life –   is a stable form of Christian living by those faithful who feel called to follow Jesus Christ in a more exacting way recognised by the Church. It is characterised by the public profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in a stable state of life recognised by the Church. Consecrated life may be lived either in institutes or individually. While those living it are either clergy (if ordained) or lay people, the state of consecrated life is neither clerical nor lay by nature. Ciborium (plural ciboria; Latin from the Ancient Greek κιβώριον (kibōrion) is a container or vessel, a normally metal.large covered cup designed to hold hosts for, and after, the Eucharist, thus the equivalent for the bread of the chalice for the wine. Counter-Reformation – Catholic Reformation, Catholic Revival – the period of Catholic revival beginning with the Council of Trent and ending at the close of the Thirty Years’ War(1648) initiated in response to the Protestant Reformation. The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as ‘the Reformation’ (from Latin reformatio, lit. “restoration, renewal”). This was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. c/f below) Credence table is a small side table in the sanctuary of a church which is used in the celebration of the Eucharist. (Latin credens, -entis, believer). Creed –a brief summary of the teachings of the faith. The most ancient is the Apostles Creed below and the Nicene Creed developed as the faith evolved. *The Apostles Creed – sets forth their doctrine “in sublime simplicity, in unsurpassable brevity, in beautiful order, and with liturgical solemnity.” In its present form it is dated no later than the fourth century. More than any other Christian creed, it may justly be called an ecumenical symbol of faith. It reads The Nicene Creed is a profession of faith widely used in Christian liturgy. It is called Nicene because it was originally adopted in the city of Nicaea (present day Iznik, Turkey) by the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The text can be found in the liturgy of the Word at Mass. It reads: Crosier (also known as a crozier, paterissa, pastoral staff, or bishop’s staff) is a stylized staff carried by high-ranking Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and some Lutheran, United Methodist and Pentecostal prelates. Other typical insignia of many of these prelates are the mitre, the pectoral cross, and the episcopal ring. The crosier (known as the pastoral staff, from the Latin pastor, shepherd) is shaped like a shepherd’s crook. A bishop or church head bears this staff as “shepherd of the flock of God”, particularly the community under his canonical jurisdiction, but any bishop, whether or not assigned to a functional diocese, may also use a crosier when conferring sacraments and presiding at liturgies. A bishop usually holds his crosier with his left hand, leaving his right hand free to bestow blessings. Crucifix (from the Latin cruci fixus meaning one fixed to a cross. The crucifix is a principal symbol for many Christian groups. It is an image of Jesus on the cross, as distinct from a simple bare cross. The representation of Jesus himself on the cross is referred to as the corpus (Latin for “body”). Large crucifixes high across the central axis of a church are known by the Old English term rood. Curia consists of a group of officials who assist in the governance of a particular Church. These curias range from the relatively simple diocesan curia, to the larger patriarchal curias, to the Roman Curia, which is the central government of the Catholic Church. Deaconate/diaconate – Greek word  diákonos (διάκονος), which is a standard ancient Greek word meaning “servant”, “waiting-man”, “minister”, or “messenger”. It is a ministry in the Christian Church that is generally associated with church service of some kind, but which varies among theological and denominational traditions. In many traditions the “deaconate”refers to the term for a deacon’s office. It is a clerical office to which to which one is ordained like priests and bishops. The Catholic Church has only male Deacons, who are ordained as a sacramental sign to the Church and to the world of Christ, who came to serve and not to be served. All ordained ministers in the Church are called to functions of Word, Sacrament, and Charity, but bishops, presbyters and deacons exercise these functions in various ways. As ministers of Word, deacons proclaim the Gospel, preach, and teach in the name of the Church. As ministers of Sacrament, deacons baptize, lead the faithful in prayer, witness marriages, and conduct Eucharistic services and funeral services. They are not ordained to say Mass. As ministers of Charity, deacons assist in identifying the needs of others and marshalling the Church’s resources to meet those needs. But no matter what specific functions a deacon performs, they flow from his sacramental identity. In other words, it is not only what a deacon does, but who a deacon is, that is important. A ‘lay’ deacon, so called by some people, is a person who may have no intention or desire to become a priest, or take on the promise o celibacy, thus may or may not marry or work full time  with the church. Death, Christian – the end of a Christian person’s earthly life and the beginning of the eternal life in heaven, in the presence of God. According to our Christian faith, each person possesses a soul that leaves their body at the point of death and goes to an afterlife in heaven or hell. Catholics. We believe that we all will be called to judgement by God for our actions and as a consequence of our actions and God’s mercy we will be rewarded with a place in heaven, punished in hell or purified in purgatory. Declaration of Nullity — a canonical judicial declaration that a marriage or matrimonial covenant was invalid from the beginning due to some point of law or actions by the parties involed. Devil – (from Greek: διάβολος or diábolos slanderer or accuser is, according to Christianity and Islam, the primary opponent of God. Traditonally Christianity identifies the Devil (“Satan”) with the Serpent who tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and describes him as a “fallen angel” who terrorizes the world through evil, is the antithesis of Truth. In the New Testament, the name Satan occurs more than 30 times in passages alongside diábolos, referring to the same person or thing as Satan. Islam identifies the Devil (“Shaitan”) with all those who oppose Allah. The Modern English word devil descends from the Middle English devel, from Old English dēofol, that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of Latin diabolus. This in turn was borrowed from Ancient Greek Greek: διάβολος (diábolos), “slanderer”. Dicastery  —  denotes the departments of the Roman Curia. c/f Curia above Diocesan administrator – a provisional ordinary of a Roman Catholic particular church. The college of consultors elects an administrator within eight days after the see is known to be vacant. The college must elect as administrator a priest or bishop at least 35 years old. Diocesan archbishop or bishop – an Archbishop or bishop in pastoral charge of an archdiocese as opposed to a titular Archbishop or bishop, whose see is only nominal, not pastoral. Diocesan chancery is the branch of administration which handles all written documents used in the official government of a Roman Catholic or Anglican diocese.or his representative, all documents which concern the diocese are drawn up, copied, forwarded, and a record kept of all official writings expedited or received. The official charged with the execution of these duties is known as the diocesan chancellor. Diocesan priest is a Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox priest who commits himself to a certain geographical area, and is ordained into the service of the citizens of a particular diocese or church administrative region. His duties include serving the everyday needs of the people in parishes but their activities are not limited to that of their parish. Discalceation means “removal of footwear”. St. Teresa of Ávila was one of a number of saints of the Roman Catholic Church who were “discalced,” or shoeless. She was one of the founders of the Discalced (barefoot) Carmelites religious order. Easter –  c/f  Liturgical Seasons below. East–West Schism – The Roman church divided medieval Christianity into Eastern (Greek) and Western (Latin) branches, which later became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, respectively. Eastern Catholic Churches – historically called Uniate Churches, are 23 self-governing particular churches in full communion with the Pope, which make up the Catholic Church together with the Latin Church. Liturgies of the 23 Eastern Catholic churches include the Byzantine, Alexandrian, Armenian, East Syrian, and West Syrian Rites, traditions that are shared with other Eastern Christian churches, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches. Although some theological issues divide them from other Eastern churches, they admit members of the latter churches to the Eucharist and the other sacraments, as governed by canon law. Eclesiastical judge (Latin: Judex -, or Judex Ecclesiasticus) is an ecclesiastical person who possesses ecclesiastical jurisdiction to deal with issues that come under his church jurisdiction. Episcopal Conference – Conference of Bishops, or National Conference of Bishops is an official assembly of all the bishops of a given territory. Episcopal vicar – is the principal deputy of the bishop of a diocese for the exercise of administrative authority and possesses the title of local ordinary. Epistle –  a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal didactic letter. The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in ancient Egypt as part of the scribal-school writing curriculum. The letters in the New Testament from Apostles to Christians are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to Paul are known as Pauline epistles, those attributed to Peter are known as Petrine or as catholic ( i.e., “general”) epistles. Eternity -an infinite or an indeterminately long period of time.It is often referred to as the afterlife, everlasting life, life after death, the life to come, the life hereafter, the hereafter, the world hereafter, the afterworld, the next world, the beyond In classical philosophy, however, eternity is defined as what exists outside time. A circle is commonly used as a symbol for eternity –no beginning or end. Eucharist – (pronunced: ˈyo͞okərist), a sacrament (Mass )containing the following elements:  a commemoration of the Last Supper, the final meal that Jesus Christ shared with his disciples before his arrest, eventual crucifixion and resurrection. Eucharistic Congress – is a gathering of clergy, religious, and laity to bear witness to the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. Congresses bring together people from a wide area, and typically involve large open-air Masses, Eucharistic adoration (Blessed Sacrament), and other devotional ceremonies held over several days. Congresses may both refer to National (varies by country) and International Eucharistic Congresses. God willing, the next and 52nd International Eucharistic Congress, will take place in Budapest, Hungry in 2020 Eucharisic Service – The Church provides a rite for of Eucharistic service outside of Mass when priests are not available to celebrate same. This type of service is becoming more and more common across the worldwide church and here in Ireland. This rite was approved by Pope Paul in 1973 as there was need of it. There is, of course, no immediate consecration of the bread and wine but rather this has been done at a previous Mass. Excardination – Freeing a member of the clergy from one jurisdiction and being transferred to another. Incardination refers to a member of the clergy being placed under the jurisdiction of a particular bishop or other ecclesiastical superior. Excommunication  – an institutional act of religious censure used to deprive, suspend, or limit membership in a religious community or to restrict certain rights within it, in particular receiving of the sacraments.

Faith – Trust, belief, confidence, conviction, credence, reliance or dependence in someone or something but it also allows for doubt. St Augustine prayed,’ O Lord , I believe, help my unbelief. It is numbered amongst the three theological virtues (faith, hope and love) meaning it is a free gift, infused into us through Divine grace. The theological virtues are so named because the object of these virtues is the divine being itself. Fall of Man— or fall of humankind, the transition of the first human parents from a state of innocent obedience to God, to a state of guilty disobedience to God. depicted in the early chapters of the Book of Genesis Family wage – a wage that is sufficient to raise a family. This contrasts with a living wage, (the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs which is generally taken to mean a wage sufficient for a single individual to live on, but not necessarily sufficient to also support a family.) As a stronger form of living wage, a family wage is likewise advocated by proponents of social justice. Father (cleric) — a traditional religious title given to ordained priests in the church. In Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Holy Trinity, father of all peoples. Jesus referred to God sometimed as Abba – an Aramaic word that would most closely be translated as “daddy.” signifying their close, intimate relationship of a father with his child, as well as the childlike trust that a young child places in his “daddy.” c/f God, names of, below Muslims believe that studying the various 99 names and attributes of Allah, (God) is one of the most effective ways of strengthening one’s relationship with God. Each Name and Attribute nourishes a kind of consciousness and humility in man and their study leads one to constantly better their actions. The Quran (Holy Book) says “The most beautiful names belong to Allah: so call on Him by them.” (Quran, 7:180). For example If one is asking for peace and tranquility in life while experiencing a period of tension, call on God by His name “As-Salaam,” meaning “The Ultimate Source of Peace.” Feastdays -The calendar of saints of ‘Saints of the Day’ (www.catholicireland.net) is a traditional Christian method of organizing a liturgical year by associating each day with one or more saints and referring to the day as the feast day or feast of said saint. (The word “feast” in this context does not mean “a large meal, typically a celebratory one”, but instead “an annual religious celebration, a day dedicated to a particular saint”.) The system arose from the early Christian custom of commemorating each martyr annually on the date of his or her death, or birth into heaven, a date therefore referred to in Latin as the martyr’s dies natalis (“day of birth”). c/f Roman Martyrology below. Font – A holy water font or stoup is a vessel containing holy water generally placed near the entrance of a church or home. It is used in Catholic Church, Anglican Church, and some Lutheran churches by making the Sign of the Cross using the holy water upon entrance or exiting the church or home. Holy water is blessed by a priest and acts as a reminder of one’s baptism and baptismal promises. Friars –  members of one of the mendicant religious orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century that adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. These orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. Some of the orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. Full communion – a relationship between church organizations or groups that mutually recognize their sharing the essential doctrines. As a practical matter for most Catholics, full communion means that a member of one Church may partake of the Eucharist celebrated in another and for priests, that they may concelebrate the Eucharist with priests of another Church. Protestants understand full communion a matter of practical relations among denominations that nonetheless fully retain their distinct identities. Funeral – a ceremony for honouring, respecting or sanctifying the life of a person who has died, and usually involves arrangements for the burial or cremation of their corpse. There are Funeral rite books available in www.Veritas.ie with appropriate prayers, hymns and scripture readings. Funeral, Rites, Music – Music is integral to the funeral rites. It allows the community to express convictions and feelings that words alone may fail to convey.  It has the power to console and uplift the bereaved and to strengthen the unity of the assembly in faith and love.  The music at funerals should support, console and uplift the participants and should help to create in them a spirit of hope in Christ’s victory over death and in the Christian’s share in that victory.The ideal is to have music which reflects the Paschal mystery, hope and consolation, families often do request favourite music which they like.  While the use of non-sacred music is not encouraged, it may be that the songs requested are not discordant with the Christian message. This should be discussed with the family and celebrant/minister. God – the Supreme Being and principal object of our faith. The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively creating the universe has caused some religions to give “Him” the metaphorical name of “Father” (which is also a metaphor for humans being God’s stewards, supreme above all creation). Because God is conceived as being invisible from direct sight and not being a corporeal being, God cannot (some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image. Most images reflect how God interacts with the cosmos, earth, nature, and us humans as is reflected in the Holy Scriptures. Christians believe God to be Triune, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. *The New Testament often  refer to God as Father/Abba, Ancient of Days,. “The Most High”. (θεός the Greek term for God),Kyrios (i.e. Lord in Greek), Pateras (πατέρας i.e. Father in Greek), the Aramaic word “Abba” meaning “Father.” Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus have salvific attributes. The name Jesus is given in Luke 1:31 and Matthew 1:21 and in both cases the name is not selected by humans but is received by angelic messages with theological significance, e.g. the statement in Matthew 1:21 “you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save his people from their sins” associates salvific attributes to the name Jesus. Emmanuel (Mt 1:23). The names of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit are inherently related in the New Testament, e.g. with Jesus’ instruction ‘baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit”. The Greek word pneuma, generally translated spirit, is found around 385 times in the New Testament. The English terms Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost have identical meanings, Three separate terms, namely Holy Spirit, Spirit of Truth and Paraclete are used in John 14:17, 15:26 and 16:13. *Islamic faith , The Qur’an refers to – Allāh (Arabic term with no plural) meaning “the God”, or “the Deity”—is the most frequently used name of God in Islam. the Qur’an says ‘to Him Belong the Best Names’ (Lahu Al-Asmao Al-Husna), examples like Ar-Rahman (The Entirely Merciful), Ar-Rahim (The Especially Merciful). *Hinduism– God may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of Hinduism which emphasize the personal nature of God, with early references to his name as Krishna-Vasudeva in Bhagavata or later Vishnu and Hari. Grace – in theology grace has been defined as “a free gift of love and mercy given to us by God because He desires us to have it, and not because of anything we have done to earn it”, a spontaneous benevolence shown by God toward the human race”, generous, free and totally unexpected and undeserved” that takes the form of divine favor, love, clemency – a share in the divine life of God. Grace – a prayer. Grace and thanksgiving imparts a blessing which sanctifies or thankful praise. It can be said before or after eating meal. Reciting such a prayer is often referred to as “saying grace”. A prayer of ‘Grace’ is said by the head of the house although any family member or an honoured guest may be asked to offer it before/after a meal: Before: Bless us, O Lord, and these your gifts, which from your bounty we are about to receive, through Christ  our Lord. (Response ): Amen. Heaven – this is the location of God’s abode, the throne of God and the beatific vision of the Lord, and the dwelling place of the angels The Scriptures tell us that the resurrected Jesus ascended to heaven where he now sits at the Right Hand of God the Father In traditional Christianity, heaven is also understood as the abode for the redeemed dead in the afterlife. According to Roman Catholic teaching, Mary, mother of Jesus, is also said to have been assumed into heaven. St Paul in 1 Corinthians 2:9 says “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.” Hell – The Roman Catholic Catechism n.1035 defines Hell as “a state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed.” One finds themselves in Hell as the result of dying in mortal sin without repenting and accepting God’s merciful love, becoming eternally separated from Him by one’s own free choice immediately after death. It is traditionally depicted as a place of torment and punishment in an afterlife,fiery and painful, inflicting guilt and suffering. It is said to be the permanent residence of the the fallen Angel Satan, the devil, the great deceiver, the evil one. Hierarchy –bishops, priests and deacons. In the ecclesiastical sense of the term, “hierarchy” commonly means the body of men who exercise authority within a Christian church. In the Catholic Church, authority rests chiefly with the bishop, while priests and deacons serve as their assistants, co-workers or helpers. It is also used to refer to bishops alone. His Eminence –  a style of reference for high nobility, still in use in various religious contexts. The style remains in use as the official style or standard of address in reference to a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, reflecting his status as a Prince of the Church. A longer, and more formal, title is “His (or Your when addressing the cardinal directly) Most Reverend Eminence”. Patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches who are also cardinals may be addressed as “His Eminence” or by the style particular to Eastern Catholic patriarchs, His Beatitude. His Holiness – a style and form of address for supreme religious leaders, originally and most notably the Pope, Bishop of Rome and the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. His Holiness (Latin: Sanctitas) is the official style used to address the Roman Catholic Pope and the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, as head of the Orthodox community. In February 2013, the Holy See announced that former Pope Benedict XVI would retain the style “His Holiness” after resigning and becoming Pope Emeritus. Holy Days of obligation – major feasts of the Church’s year on which catholics are obliged to go to Mass. In the medieval period, days off work for the workforce in Catholic countries, consisted of Sundays and single days off on major feasts of the Church. So for the workers holyday, was the same as holiday. The Church has retained a number of its feasts, the major ones are known as Solemnities. Some of these Solemnities are known as ‘Holy days of Obligation’, when those who are able are expected to attend Mass. Holy Days, Ireland – Immaculate Conception (8th December), Christmas Day (25th December), Epiphany (6th January ), St Patrick (17th March), Assumption of Our Lady (15th August), All Saints (1st November). In Ireland since October 1996, the Irish Bishops’ Conference removed the obligation on the feasts of Ascension and the Body and Blood of Christ (Corpus Christi), and the consequent transfer of these two feasts to the following Sundays in accordance with universal liturgical law. This decision has been confirmed by the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship. Holy Door – Year of Mercy (Latin: Porta Sancta) traditionally refers to an entrance portal located within the one or all the Papal Major basilicas in Rome. The doors are normally sealed by mortar and cement from the inside so that they cannot be opened. They are ceremoniously opened during Jubilee years designated by the Pope, for pilgrims who enter through those doors may piously gain the plenary indulgences attached with the Jubilee year celebrations. Since the year 1300 when Pope Boniface VIII declared the first Holy Year, the Catholic Church has regularly celebrated “Holy Years,” usually every twenty-five years (at least since 1470), except for special circumstances, like in 1983 when a Holy Year was declared to mark the 1950th anniversary of the death and resurrection of our Lord.  A major aspect of the Holy Year has been that of pilgrimage to Rome to make reparation for sin and to renew the conversion of one’s life. In October 2015, Pope Francis broke with tradition in having each Roman Catholic diocese throughout the world designate one or more local Holy Doors during the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, so that Catholics could gain the plenary indulgences granted during the Jubilee year without having to travel to Rome. These ‘doors’ may take different forms. The year came to an end in November 201 Holy Hour – an hour set aside for prayer and reflection either privately in a quiet  or holy place. It can also refer to a hour of public prayer in a church or shrine with or without the blessed Sacrament exposed. Holy Orders – in the church there are three degrees of sacramental orders: bishop, priest, and deacon. . In the phrase “holy orders”, the word “holy”  means “set apart for some purpose.” “Orders” is simply a group within a hierarchical structure that is set apart for ministry in the Church. Ordination to the Diaconate typically happens in the last year of seminary training that a man will be ordained to the “transitional diaconate.” After six months or more as a transitional deacon, a man will be ordained to the priesthood. Priests are able to preach, perform baptisms, witness marriages, hear confessions and give absolution, anoint the sick, and celebrate the Eucharist or the Mass. Some priests go on to be chosen to be bishops.This distinguishes men bound for priesthood from those who have entered the “permanent diaconate” and do not intend to seek ordination as a priest. Deacons, whether transitional or permanent, receive faculties to preach, to perform baptisms, and to witness marriages. They may assist at the Eucharist or the Mass, but are not the ministers of the Eucharist. Holy See – the Episcopal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), and is the preeminent episcopal see of the world wide Catholic Church, forming the central government of the Church. It is a very small  independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and form a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes. As an independent sovereign entity, holding the Vatican City enclave in Rome as sovereign territory, it maintains diplomatic relations with an immense number of other states. It is viewed as analogous to a state while administered by the Roman Curia (Latin for Roman Court), similar to a centralised government with the Cardinal Secretary of State as its chief administrator, and various dicasteries, comparable to ministries and executive departments. Holy Water – Holy water is water blessed by a pope, bishop, priest or deacon, and is used to bless oneself, others or other objects. It is also used as a reminder of our baptism. Hope -(latin spes) is one of the three theological virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) in the Christian tradition. Hope being a combination of the desire for something and expectation of receiving it, it is ultimately the virtue is hoping for Divine union and eternal happiness. Like all virtues, it arises from the will, not the passions and is infused in us from/by God. The Christian who hopes seeks God for himself or herself. In technical language, the formal object of theological hope is God-as-possessed. Hypostasis —refers to the union of two natures divine and human, in the one divine person of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Immaculate Conception — the dogma of the conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (in the womb of her mother, St Anne), but free from original sin by God in virtue of the foreseen merits of her son Jesus Christ. – (not to be confused with the Incarnation of the Word of God) Incarnation of Christ— Latin ‘in carne’ enfleshment of The Word of God taking on a human nature and remaining God -becoming a true man named Jesus, Son of God and Mary, daughter of St Anne. This divine/human action is a central mystery of our faith Institute of consecrated life – institutes or groupings in the Catholic Church whose members profess the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience as vows or other sacred bonds. Institute, Religious — institutes, which are characterized by the public profession of vows, life in common as brothers or sisters, and separation from the world. Intercession/intercessory prayer – the act of praying to God on behalf of others. In Western Christianity, intercession forms a distinct form of prayer, alongside Adoration, Confession and Thanksgiving. Jesus – (/ˈdʒiːzəs/; Greek: Ἰησοῦς Iesous; c. 4 BC to AD 30–33), was also referred to as: Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, the long awaited Messiah (or the Christ, the Anointed One) promised in the Old Testament. Jesus – Names of –There are over 200 of names of Jesus in the New Testament. Many of the names of Jesus come from the Gospels directly, others arose from his parables or sayings, others again came later on reflection. Jubilee Year of Mercy – (Latin: Iubilaeum Extraordinarium Misericordiae) is a Roman Catholic period of prayer held from the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8), 2015 to the Feast of Christ the King (November 20), 2016. Like previous jubilees, it is seen by the Church as a period for remission of sins and universal pardon focusing particularly on God’s forgiveness and mercy. It is an extraordinary Jubilee because it had not been predetermined long before; usually ordinary jubilees take place every 25 years. The 2016 Jubilee was first announced by Pope Francis on March 13, 2015. It was declared in the Pope’s April 2015 papal bull of indiction,’ Misericordiae Vultus’ (Latin: “The Face of Mercy”). It is the 27th holy year in history, following the ordinary 2000 Jubilee during John Paul II papacy. The opening day was also the fiftieth anniversary of the closing of the Second Vatican Council. In prior months it was stressed that the Pontiff wishes the Jubilee to be celebrated not only in Rome but all around the world; for the first time holy doors are going to be opened in many dioceses across the world, either in the main cathedral or in local historical churches. The first holy door was opened by Pope Francis in Bangui on November 29, 2015 during a tour of East Africa (c/f Holy Doors above). Other doors have been opened since across the globe. Judicial Vicar – (Latin:officialis) is an officer of the diocese who has ordinary power to judge cases in the diocesan ecclesiastical court. Justification by faith – is God’s act of removing the guilt and penalty of sin while at the same time declaring a sinner righteous i.e.being made righteous, just, holy, and acceptable before God through Christ’s atoning sacrifice.  Protestantism protest that righteousness from God is viewed as being credited to the sinner’s account through faith alone, without works and they lean heavily on S Paul’s writing for support. The Catholic Church maintains that St. James says we are justified by works as well as by faith. Is this not a contradiction? Not if we recognize that St. James is using the word “Justification” in a slightly different sense to that in which St. Paul uses it. Put very simply, Paul uses “justification” to mean to change from being “bad” in God’s sight (state of sin) to being “good” (state of grace). James, however, uses the same word to mean being kept good—and becoming even better—in God’s sight. Just war theory (jus bellum iustum) is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics studied by theologians, ethicists, policy makers, and military leaders. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. Keys of the Kingdom – c/f Matthew 16:19. Jesus had asked His disciples who people thought He was. After responding with several of the more popular opinions, Jesus aimed His question directly at His disciples. Peter, responding for the twelve, acknowledged Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the Living God. After this great confession, Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matt 16:17-19). Keys are used to lock or unlock doors. In this text, Jesus is laying the foundation of His church (Ephesians 2:20). The disciples will be the leaders of this new institution, and Jesus is giving them the authority to, as it were, open the doors to heaven and invite the world to enter. Kiss of peace – an ancient traditional Christian greeting. Also called “Holy kiss”, “Brother kiss” among men, or “Sister kiss” among women. Some congregations do not perform inter-gender holy-kissing. The practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches where it is often called the kiss of peace, sign of peace, Holy kiss or simply peace or pax. Laity – There are estimated to be over one billion Roman Catholics in the world. The majority of these are lay Catholics, also known as the laity, which includes all Roman Catholics, except those who are part of the clergy. These faithful are by baptism made one body with Christ and are constituted among the People of God; they are in their own way made sharers in the priestly, prophetical, and kingly functions of Christ; and they carry out for their own part the mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the world Lapsed Catholic — a Catholic who has ceased believing the teaching or practicing the Catholic faith.  Such a person is said to have lapsed from all or some of the faith. (‘a la carte Catholic’) Such a person may still identify as a Catholic and remains a Catholic. Last Rites- The Sacrament of the Anointing of the sick is no longer referred to as the last rites or Extreme Unction as its use has been extended to all those who are seriously sick and not just the dying. It is a ritual of healing appropriate not only for physical but also for mental and spiritual sickness. c/f Anointing of the Sick above. Latin Church –  a group of Christian faithful united by a hierarchy according to the norm of law which the supreme authority of the Church expressly or tacitly recognizes as ‘sui iuris’. There are several such ‘sui iuris’ particular churches within the Catholic Church. Sui iuris, is a Latin phrase which literally means “of one’s own right” Latin Rites –  liturgical rites  used within that area of the Catholic Church where the Latin language once dominated. Their number is now much reduced. In the aftermath of the Council of Trent, in 1568 and 1570 Pope Pius V suppressed the Breviaries and Missals that could not be shown to have an antiquity of at least two centuries. Many local rites that remained legitimate even after this decree were abandoned voluntarily, especially in the 19th century. In the second half of the 20th century. A few such liturgical rites persist today for the celebration of Mass, since 1965-1970 in revised forms, but the distinct liturgical rites for celebrating the other sacraments have been almost completely abandoned. The Roman Rite is by far the most widely used. Like other liturgical rites, it developed over time, with newer forms replacing the older. c/f Tridentine Mass Rite Laws of the Church – Canon Law of the Catholic Church (Ecclesiastical Latin: Jus Canonicum) is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the Church. c/f Canon law above Lay Ecclesial Ministry is the term adopted by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to identify the relatively new category of pastoral ministers in the Catholic Church who serve the Church but are not ordained. Lay ecclesial ministers are co-workers with the bishop alongside priests and deacons. He/she is an individual who wishes to serve the Church while remaining in secular employment. He/ she is required to attend a programme of training to enhance his/her biblical knowledge, theology and worship and, of course, how to conduct a Service for which there are strict guidelines. Upon successful completion of the programme, he/she is commissioned as a lay Minister. A Mass has the important aspect of the Consecration of bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ. Neither a Lay Minister nor a Deacon is authorized to consecrate Lectio Divina – (Latin for “Divine Reading”) is a traditional Benedictine practice of scriptural reading, meditation and prayer intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God’s Word. It does not treat Scripture as texts to be studied, but as the Living Word. Traditionally, Lectio Divina has four separate steps: read; meditate; pray; contemplate. First a passage of Scripture is read, then its meaning is reflected upon. This is followed by prayer and contemplation on the Word of God. The focus of Lectio Divina is not a theological analysis of biblical passages but viewing them with Christ as the key to their meaning. Lectionary is a book or listing that contains a collection of scripture readings appointed for worship on a given day or occasion. Lector – a  reader is responsible for reading aloud excerpts of the scripture at a liturgy. He reads from a lecturn c/f (below) Lecturn – the place or stand from which a lector reads his assigned scripture text. Legion of Mary -(Latin: Legio Mariae) is an international association of the faithful of the Catholic Church who serve the Church on a voluntary basis. It was founded in Dublin, Ireland, as a Roman Catholic Marian Movement by layman Frank Duff. Today between active and auxiliary (praying) members there are over 10 million members worldwide making it the largest apostolic organization of lay people in the Catholic Church. Membership is highest in South Korea, Philippines, Brazil, Argentina and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These countries have between 250,000 and 500,000 members each. To be in the Legion of Mary, one must be a practicing Catholic. Active members serve God under the banner of Mary by practicing the Spiritual Works of Mercy. The main apostolate of the Legion consists in activities directed towards all men and women, young and old, rich and poor as well as people from the margins of society (homeless, prostitutes, prisoners etc.) and towards non-Catholics. The members of the Legion are primarily engaged in the performance of the Spiritual Works of Mercy rather than works of material aid. Lent –  c/f  Liturgical Seasons below. Limbo — from the Latin limbus, edge or boundary, referring to the “edge” of Hell.  It is a speculative idea about the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin. Medieval theologians of western Europe described the afterworld/underworld  as divided into four distinct parts: Hell of the Damned, Purgatory, Limbo of the Fathers or Patriarchs, and Limbo of the Infants. Limbo is not an official doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church nor is it mentioned in the1994 or 1997 Cathechism of the Catholic Church. It is important to stress that all children are children of God. We canconfidently entrust all such clildren, born, unborn, baptised and unbaptisd to God’s loving kindness and endless mercy Liturgical Colours –  refer to the colour of church vestments and altar appendages that appear in connection with different seasons of the liturgical year. i.e. Ordinary time: green, Advent and Lent  purple c/f Liturgial Seasons (below) Liturgical Seasons – The liturgical, Church or Christian year, consists of the cycle of liturgical seasons that determine when feast days, including celebrations of saints, are to be observed, and which portions of Scripture are to be read either in an annual cycle or in the Sunday cycle of three years. The Catholic Church sets aside certain days and seasons of each year to recall and celebrate various events in the life of Christ. In its Roman Rite the liturgical year begins with Advent, the time of preparation for both the celebration of Jesus’ birth, and his expected second coming at the end of time. This season lasts from four Sundays before Dec 24(Christmas Eve). Christmastide follows, beginning with First Vespers of Christmas on the evening of 24 December and ending with the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. Lent is the period of purification and penance that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday. The Holy Thursday evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper marks the beginning of the Easter Triduum, which includes Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday. The days of the Easter Triduum recall Jesus’ Last Supper with his disciples, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection. The seven-week liturgical season of Eastertime immediately follows the Triduum, climaxing at Pentecost. This last feast recalls the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus’ disciples after the Ascension of Jesus. The rest of the liturgical year is commonly known as Ordinary Time when we reflect on the words and actions of Jesus while he preached to his followers and trained the Twelve apostles. Latria — worship, adoration, reverence or prayer owed/directed  to God alone. It carries an emphasis on the internal form of worship. A most common use of latria in the Church is adoration of the Lord in/at the Eucharist. Liturgy – (Greek: λειτουργία) is the customary public worship – a communal response to the sacred through activity reflecting praise, thanksgiving, supplication, or repentance. Local ordinary – local hierarchy or local church authority is the bishop of the area. Priests and deacons are his assistants. Mass on Internet/TV –  The first thing to remember is that a televised Mass is not a substitute for assisting at Mass within a parish faith community and does not fulfill the Sunday precept. If you truly cannot go to a physical Mass, then the obligation is suspended. If you are sick, you don’t have to fulfill the obligation. If you are old and afraid to go out alone, or that you might slip on the ice, you don’t have to fulfill the obligation. If you are far from a church while travelling and don’t know where to go or can’t get to a church, you don’t have to fulfill the obligation.  If you are taking care of a sick person and cannot leave, you are not obliged to go to Mass. The 1983 Code of Canon Law, in can. 1245 gives to pastors or  “the parish priest” the ability to grant a dispensation from the obligation in individual cases or else to commute the obligation to other pious works. You can debate whether or not watching Mass on TV or the internet counts as a “pious work”. The limitation of the medium of Internet/television “with its inherent lack of physical interaction with others can lead people to more passive roles as spectators.” But the benefits for those who make use of it outweigh the dangers involved. Many regard televised liturgies as a means of evangelization, of sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ and promoting the Church’s worship via modern means of communication (cf. Church Document “Inter Mirifica,” No. 14).” Live transmission is practically the only form contemplated in the Italian norms due to the particular Italian situation in which Mass is transmitted live every Sunday by one of the national public television stations, either from the Vatican or from a different church or cathedral every week. A next-best solution is the delayed telecast, which is the taping of a Sunday Mass and its transmission on the same day. The least satisfactory solution, to be avoided if possible, is the pre-recorded telecast.  Viewers must be informed that it is pre-recorded and has certain limitations such as having been celebrated outside the liturgical day or season. The guidelines give as an example the “taping of ‘Christmas morning Mass’ on Monday of the fourth week of Advent.” Mariology— the theology concerned with the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Mary, Names of – According to the New Testament, Mary (Aramaic: Mariam; Hebrew: Miriam; also known as Saint Mary, the Virgin Mary, Our Lady, and the Madonna woman of Nazareth and the mother of Jesus. To distinguish her from the many other Marys appearing in the gospels, she is a often referred to as “Mary, mother of Jesus”. Mediatrix — the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary as a (female human) mediator in the salvation process, “This intercessory role is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator. Metropolitan bishop – A Latin Church Metropolitan is the bishop of the principal (the “metropolitan”) see of an ecclesiastical province composed of several dioceses. He receives a pallium from the pope as a symbol of his office. The metropolitan bishop has limited oversight authority over the suffragan dioceses in their province, including ensuring that the faith and ecclesiastical discipline are properly observed. Military ordinariate – an ecclesiastical jurisdiction responsible for the pastoral care of Catholics serving in the armed forces of a nation. Miracles – an event not explicable by natural or scientific laws – a phenomenon not explained by known laws of nature. Such an event may be attributed to a supernatural being (a deity), magic, a miracle worker, a saint or a religious leader. The gospels record three sorts of miracles performed by Jesus: exorcisms, cures, and nature wonders. In the Gospel of John the miracles are referred to as “signs” and the emphasis is on God demonstrating his underlying normal activity in remarkable ways. In the New Testament, the greatest miracle is the resurrection of Jesus, the event central to Christian faith. Missal – a liturgical book containing all instructions and texts necessary for the celebration of Mass or Eucharist throughout the year. Missal, Roman – Roman Missal (Latin: Missale Romanum) is the liturgical book that contains the texts and rubrics for the celebration of the Mass in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Mitre – Greek: μίτρα, “headband” or “turban”), is part of ceremonial head-dress of bishops and certain abbots in traditional Christianity; continuing the priestly practice of Temple Judaism. They are worn in the Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, as well as in the Anglican Communion, some Lutheran churches, and also bishops and certain other clergy in the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Monk (from Latin monachus) is a person who practices religious asceticism, living either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy. In modern English the term monk is mainly in use for men. The word nun is typically used for female monastics. Monsignor –  (english pronunciation: ‘mon-see-knor’) is an honorific form of address for those members of the clergy of the Catholic Church including bishops, honorary prelates and canons. In some cases, these ecclesiastical honorific titles derive from the pope, but in other cases it is simply a customary or honorary style belonging to a prelate or honorary prelate. These are granted to individuals who have rendered valuable service to the Church, or who provide some special function in Church governance, or who are members of bodies such as certain chapters. It is abbreviated Mgr, Msgr, or Mons.Mortal Sin –c/f  Sin mortal (below) Nave – the main body of the church. It provides the central approach to the high altar. The term nave is from medieval Latin navis (ship). A ship was an early Christian symbol. Narthex is an architectural element of a church building consisting of the entrance or lobby area, located at the west end of the nave, opposite the church’s main altar. Novice – is a prospective member of a religious institute who is being tried and being proven for suitability of admission to a religious order of brothers, sisters or monks. They are not admitted to vows until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving. The legislated length and conditions by which anyone aspiring to become a monk or religious  is obliged to be a novice is normally at least one year. Nun – a member of a religious community of women, typically one living under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. She may have decided to dedicate her life to serving all other living beings, or she might be an ascetic who voluntarily chose to leave mainstream society and live her life in prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent. While in common usage the terms “nun” and “sister” are often used interchangeably (the same title of “Sister” for an individual member of both forms), they are considered different ways of life, with a “nun” being a religious woman who lives a contemplative and cloistered life of meditation and prayer for the salvation of others, while a “religious sister”, in religious institutes like Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity, lives an active vocation of both prayer and service, often to the needy, ill, poor, and uneducated. Nuncio (officially known as an Apostolic nuncio and also known as a papal nuncio) is the title for an ecclesiastical diplomat, being an envoy or permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or international organization. A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See, and is the head of the diplomatic mission, called an Apostolic Nunciature, which is the equivalent of an embassy. A nuncio is usually an archbishop. He performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Ordinary time – c/f  Liturgical Seasons below. Papal or (Pontifical) Family or Household – (Latin: Domus Pontificalis), called until 1968 the Papal Court (Pontificalis Aula).  consists of ecclesiastics at the Holy See who participate in religious ceremonies (Cappella Pontificia) . Historically, they chanted divine service daily in the papal palace, with the Pope in person celebrating or assisting at Pontifical Mass on certain days. The Familia Pontificia), which assists the pope as a juridical body with civil functions. Parish – (Latin: parochus) is a stable community of the faithful within a diocese headed by a bishop, whose pastoral care has been entrusted to a parish priest (Latin: pastor), under the authority of the bishop. It is the primary constituent unit of a diocese.Most parishes are territorial parishes, which comprise all Catholics living within a defined geographic area. A parish may be joined with others in a deanery or vicariate forane and overseen by a vicar forane, also known as a dean or archpriest. As per canon 518, a bishop may also erect non-territorial parishes, or personal parishes, within his diocese. Parish priest – (Latin: pastor), is under the authority of the bishop. It is the primary constituent unit of a diocese. They are also created to better serve Catholics of a particular rite, language, nationality, or other commonality which make them a distinct community. Pastor – The word “pastor” derives from the Latin noun pastor which means “shepherd” and relates to the Latin verb pascere – “to lead to pasture, set to grazing, cause to eat”. The term “pastor” also relates to the role of elder within the New Testament, but is not synonymous with the biblical understanding of minister. Many Protestant churches call their ministers “pastors”. Bishops in Western Christianity often bear a formal crosier in the form of a stylised shepherd’s crook as a symbol of their pastoral/shepherding functions. Patron Saint – a saint who in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate, protector or guardian of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family, person or any area of our lives.  They are sometimes nominated by popes but not necessarily. Anyone can select any saint as a patron. e.g St Joseph, when one is moving house. It is connected to the idea of the communion of saints. Personal Ordinariate – often called a “personal ordinariate for former Anglicans or more informally an “Anglican ordinariate”, is a canonical structure within the Catholic Church established in accordance with the apostolic constitution, Anglicanorum Coetibus of 4 November 2009and its complementary norms.The ordinariates were established in order to enable “groups of Anglicans” to join the Catholic Church while preserving elements of their liturgical and spiritual patrimony. They are juridically equivalent to diocese, “a particular church in which and from which exists the one and unique Catholic Church, but may be erected in the same territory as other dioceses “by reason of the rite of the faithful or some similar reason.” Personal prelature – a canonical structure which comprises a prelate, clergy and laity who undertake specific pastoral activities. The first, and thus far the onlypersonal prelature is Opus Dei. Personal prelatures, similar to dioceses and military ordinariates, are under the governance of the Vatican’s Congregation for Bishops. Pentecost –  c/f  Liturgical Seasons below. Pew –  a long bench seat or enclosed box, used for seating members of a congregation or choir in a church or sometimes a courtroom. Pontiff – from Latin pontifex, a word commonly held to come from the Latin root words pons (bridge) + facere (to do, to make), and so to have the literal meaning of “bridge-builder”. Most commonly it refers to the Bishop of Rome, the Pope- the Supreme Pontiff. Prayer – (Latin precari “to ask earnestly, beg, entreat”) is an invocation or act that seeks to connect with God or some holy person  Prayer may be directed towards a deity, spirit, holy or deceased person, for the purpose of worshipping, requesting guidance, requesting assistance, confessing transgressions (sins) or to express one’s thoughts and emotions. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit, asking for divine grace, spiritual connection, or for the sake of others. Prayer may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private. It may involve the use of words, song or complete silence. When language is used, prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. Prayer online – An online invitation to make a ‘Sacred Space’ in your day, praying here and now, as you visit this website, with the help of scripture chosen every day and on-screen c/f www.sacredspace.ie/ Predestination and Free will – predestination is, “God’s act of decreeing or foreordaining events from eternity or, from eternity, whatever comes to pass. It is used particularly in theology to denote the preordination of people to everlasting happiness or misery. Free will is our ability to make choices according to our desire. God’s predestination does not mean that we cannot make free will choices. God predestines in and through our choices because God is all-knowing and all-powerful. He knows what we will do because He knows all things. He cannot not know all things. So, whatever you choose to do out of your own free volition is known. But His knowing doesn’t mean you don’t freely choose. An illustration would be that I could arrange for my child to choose ice cream over something else and not violate his free will. For instance, I could put a bowl of chocolate ice cream and a bowl of dirt and rocks in front of my child, and I know exactly which one the child will choose to eat. But my knowing does not violate my child’s free will. Prelate is a high-ranking member of the clergy who is an ordinary or who ranks in precedence with ordinaries. The word derives from the Latin prælatus, “be set above or over” or “prefer”; hence, a prelate is one set over others. The archetypal prelate is a bishop, whose prelature is his particular church. All other prelates, including the regular prelates such as abbots and major superiors, are based upon this original model of prelacy. Presbytery – (residence), a clergy house, especially for the home of one or more Roman Catholic priests. Presbyterium – a body of ordained, active priests in the Roman Catholic or Anglican churches or  a body of Church elders and ministers, especially (in Presbyterian Churches) an administrative body (court) representing all the local congregations of a district. Priest – The ministerial orders of the Church are those of bishop, presbyter (priest in English), and deacon. All the baptized faithful share the common priesthood with Jesus Christ himself. All who, through the Sacrament of Holy Orders, share in the person of Christ, the Head of His Body, the Church. Their priesthood is thus different in function and essence. “The Latin word ‘sacerdos’ is used to refer in general to the ministerial priesthood shared by bishops and presbyters. An ordained priest is commonly addressed with the title “Father”. Prior –derived from the Latin for “earlier, first”, (or prioress for nuns) is an ecclesiastical title for a superior, usually lower in rank than an abbot or abbess. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior. c/f Abbot above Prophet – an individual who has claimed to have been contacted by the supernatural or the divine, and to speak for them, serving as an intermediary with humanity, delivering this newfound knowledge from the supernatural entity to other people. The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy, which transports —at least in Judaism— a message beyond mere pagan soothsaying, augury, divination, or forecasting, and, often comprises issues of social justice. Claims of prophet-hood have existed in many cultures through history, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, in Ancient Greece, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism and many others. Traditionally, prophets are regarded as having a role in society that promotes change due to their messages and actions which can convey the displeasure of God for the behaviour of people. Providence, Divine – the foreseeing care and guidance of God over nature all the creatures of the earth and us with wise loving benevolence. Psalms, Book of – (Hebrew: תְּהִלִּים‎ or תהילים, Tehillim, “praises”), c The Book of Psalms commonly referred to simply as Psalms or “the Psalms”, is the first book of the “Writings”, the third section of the Hebrew Bible, and a book of the Christian Old Testament. The title is derived from the Greek translation, ψαλμοί psalmoi, meaning “instrumental music” and, by extension, “the words accompanying the music.” The book is an anthology of individual psalms, with 150 in the Jewish and Western Christian tradition and more in the Eastern Christian churches. Many of the psalms are linked to the name of King David, although his authorship is not accepted by some modern Bible scholars. They are a great source of support and consolation e.g. Ps 24 the Good Shepherd Psalm ‘Ratum sed non consummatum’ – (Latin phrase: ratified but not consummated) refers to a specific type of marriage in Catholic matrimonial canon law. If a matrimonial celebration takes place (ratification) but the spouses have not yet engaged in intercourse (consummation), then the marriage is said to be a marriage ‘ratum sed non consummatum.’ The Tribunal of the Roman Rota has exclusive competence to dispense from marriages ‘ratum sed non consummatum’, which can only be granted for a ‘just reason.’ Reader –  an  appointed person who is responsible for reading aloud excerpts of the scripture at a liturgy. In early Christian times, the reader was of particular value due to the rarity of literacy. Rector – an ecclesiastical sense, a cleric who functions as an administrative leader in some Christian denominations. Relics of saints –  the Bible condones the veneration of relics – parts of the bodies of holy people. In the Old Testament, the Second Book of Kings records that a dead man was brought back to life when his corpse came into contact with the bones of the great prophet Elisha (cf. II Kings 13:20-21). The Acts of the Apostles describe how pieces of cloth that had touched St. Paul’s skin were used to heal the sick and cast out evil spirits (cf. Acts 19:11-12). By the second century, the veneration of relics was already a widespread Christian practice. After St. Polycarp of Smyrna had been burnt at the stake, for example, his faithful disciples carried off his remains. “We took up his bones,” they later recorded, “which are more valuable than precious stones and finer than refined gold, and laid them in a suitable place, where the Lord will permit us to gather ourselves together, as we are able, in gladness and joy, and to celebrate the birthday of his martyrdom.” But even if modern secularism considers relics as leftovers from an uncivilized, superstitious past, the Catholic Church doesn’t. Relics are of three classes: 1. First-class relics are parts of the saint’s body (these are often placed in altars at their consecration); 2. Second-class relics are part of the clothing or anything used during the saint’s life; and 3. Third-class relics are any other object, such as a piece of cloth, that has been touched to a first-class relic. Canon law strictly forbids the buying and selling of relics, a practice which bred abuses in past centuries. Religious (using the word as a noun i.e ‘a religious’ ) what in common language one would call a “monk” or “nun”, as opposed to an ordained “priest”. A religious may also be a priest if he has undergone ordination, but in general he is not. Religious Institute – a society in which members pronounce or make public vows and lead a life of brothers or sisters in common”. Religious Orders –  a category of Catholic religious institutes. Subcategories are canons regular (canons and canonesses regular who recite the divine office and serve a church and perhaps a parish); monastics (monks or nuns living and working in a monastery and reciting the divine office); mendicants (friars or religious sisters who live from alms, recite the divine office, and, in the case of the men, participate in apostolic activities); and clerks regular (priests who take religious vows and have a very active apostolic life). Resurrection, of Jesus is the Christian religious belief that, after being put to death, Jesus rose again from the dead. It is the central tenet of Christian theology and part of the Nicene Creed: “On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures.” In the New Testament, after the Romans crucified Jesus, he was anointed and buried in a new tomb by Joseph of Arimathea but God raised him from the dead and he appeared to many people over a span of forty days before he ascended into heaven, to sit at the right hand of God. The Resurrection of Jesus is the basis of our hope for our own resurrection. Roman Catholic Church – a term which appeared in the English language at the beginning of the 17th century to differentiate members of the Catholic Church (in communion with the Pope) from other Christians who use the term “Catholic”; comparable terms in other languages already existed. Being “catholic” is one of the Four Marks of the Church set out in the Nicene Creed, a statement of belief accepted by many churches even if not in communion with the Pope. The church known as the “Catholic Church” consists of 24 autonomous churches (all of which are subject to the Pope)— one “Western” and 23 “Eastern” — governed by the same two sets of codes of canon law. “Roman Catholic” is used by some governments and scholars to refer to members of the majority Latin Church within the Catholic Church. In compound forms such as “Roman Catholic worship” the term is sometimes used to differentiate Western (Latin Church) practices from Eastern. Roman Martyrology (Latin: Martyrologium Romanum) is the official martyrology of the Catholic Church. Its use is obligatory in matters regarding the Roman Rite liturgy, but dioceses, countries and religious institutes may add to it duly approved appendices. It provides an extensive but not exhaustive list of the saints recognized by the Church. Rosary or Chaplet – (Latin: rosarium, in the sense of “crown of roses” or “garland of roses”), is a form of prayer used especially in the Catholic Church named for the string of prayer beads used to count the component prayers. The prayers that essentially compose the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys with each set preceded by one Lord’s Prayer and followed by one Glory Be. During recitation of each set, known as a decade, thought is given to one of the Mysteries of the Rosary, which recall events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. Normally, five decades are recited in a session. Other prayers are sometimes decade) and before each recitation e.g, the Apostles’ Creed, and after i.e, the Hail, Holy Queen. A standard fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary, based on the long-standing custom, was established by Pope Pius V in the 16th century, grouping the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. In 2002 Pope John Paul II suggested a new set of five, called the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to twenty. Sacraments – ceremonies that point to what is sacred, significant and important for Christians. They are special occasions for experiencing God’s saving presence. They are at the same time signs and instruments of God’s grace. Sacraments, seven – Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. They touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life. The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments are necessary for salvation”, although not all are necessary for every individual. c/f them the sacraments individually above. Sacrament of Penance – (commonly called Confession, Reconciliation or Penance) is one of seven sacraments of the Catholic Church and sacred mysteries of Eastern Christianity, in which the faithful obtain divine mercy for the sins committed against God and neighbour and are reconciled with the community of the Church. By this sacrament Christians are freed from sins committed after Baptism. The sacrament of Penance is considered the normal way to be absolved from mortal sins which would otherwise seperate a person fron union with God. As biblical basis for this sacrament, the Catholic Church refers to James 5:16, “confess your sins to one another” and to Jesus’ breathing the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, saying “Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained” (John 20:23). Sacred Heart Devotion – This devotion (also known as the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Sacratissimi Cordis Iesu in Latin) is one of the most widely practiced and well-known Roman Catholic devotions, taking Jesus Christ’s physical heart as the representation of His divine love for humanity.It is also popular among some high-church Anglicans and Lutherans. The devotion is especially concerned with what the Church deems to be the love and compassion of the heart of Christ towards humanity, and its long suffering. The origin of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a Roman Catholic nun from France, Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions to her between 1673 and 1675. The Sacred Heart is often depicted in Christian art as a flaming heart shining with divine light, pierced by the lance-wound, encircled by the crown of thorns, surmounted by a cross, and bleeding. Sometimes the image is shown shining within the bosom of Christ with his wounded hands pointing at the heart. The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of Jesus’ death, while the fire represents the transformative power of divine love. Safeguarding – the Irish church child protection policy or the Catholic Church in Ireland: ‘Our Children, Our Church’, is published by the Irish Episcopal Conference, the Conference of Religious of Ireland and the Irish Missionary Union. It can be viewed online on the Irish Catholic Bishop’s conference website c/f www.safeguarding.ie and all religious orders’ websites or in all public church buildings that include services with/for children. c/f Child Protection Policy (above) Sede Vacante – a latin expression that refers to the vacancy of the episcopal see of a particular church. It is Latin for “the seat being vacant” (the ablative absolute of sedes vacans “vacant seat”, or the Italian for the same term), the seat in question being the cathedra of the particular church. After the death or resignation of a pope, the Holy See enters a period of sede vacante. In this case the particular church is the Diocese of Rome and the “vacant seat” is the cathedra of Saint John Lateran, the cathedral church of the Bishop of Rome. During this period, the Holy See is administered by a regency of the College of Cardinals. Shrine – a holy or sacred place of religious devotion, dedicated to a specific deity, ancestor, hero, martyr, saint, or similar figure of awe and respect, at which they are venerated or worshipped.  Shrines often contain relics, statues or other such objects associated with the figure being venerated. Shrines, Irish – Knock, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Mellifontabbey, Christchuch, St Patrick’s Cathedral, Monasterboice, Croagh Patrick, Rock of Cashel, Skellg Michael, St Peter’s, Drogheda, Lough Derg. Shrines, International – International – Divine Mercy Sanctuary, Kraków, Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, Sanctuary of Fátima,, Lourdes, Rome, Jerusalem, too many to list  here. Sin – an offence, wrong-doing, misdeed, any act of violating God’s will or any action that violates the ideal relationship between an individual and God; or an individual and any other person. Ill treating any other creature can also be viewed a sin. Sin, Original – entered the human world through Adam and Eve’s sin in the Garden of Eden  and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin. Sin, Mortal – seriously wrong actions, omissions performed with full knowledge and consent that cause one to break one’s relationship with God and lose salvation unless the sinner repents and receives forgiveness. Sin, Venial – wrong actions against God or other people that rupture our relationship with God and require some sort of penance either on Earth or in the afterlife e.g Purgatory. Slavery and the Church – The following Popes all condemned slavery. Pope Eugene IV in 1435, Pius II in 1482, Paul III in 1537 He imposed excommunication on those who took part in it), Urban VIII in 1689, Benedict the XIV in 1741 and Gregory XVI in 1838. The Catechism of 1992 continued this long tradition saying the 7th Commandment fibids acts that lead to theesavement f human beings, to their being bought, sold,or exchanged like merchandise, in disregard of their human dignity. Synod – (pronounced sɪned),  comes from the Greek “σύνοδος” (synodos) meaning “assembly” or “meeting”, and it is synonymous with the Latin word “concilium” meaning “council”.a council of a church, usually convened to decide an issue of doctrine, administration or application. Originally, synods were meetings of bishops, In modern usage, the word often refers to the governing body of a particular church or diocese, e.g Limerick Diocesan Synod 2016 involving laity as well as clergy. Sometimes the phrase “general synod” or “general council” refers to an ecumenical council. The word “synod” also refers to the standing council of high-ranking bishops governing. Tabernacle, Old Testament – means “tent,” “place of dwelling” or “sanctuary.” It was a sacred place where God chose to meet His people, according to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable earthly dwelling place for the divine presence, from the  time of the Exodus. The image to the left is as Moses designed it – a tent of meeting Tabernacle, Church – A tabernacle is a fixed locked box in the sanctuary in which the Eucharist is reserved after Mass. When Mass is over the consecrated hosts now the containing the sacramental presence of Jesus are placed in the tabernacle for veneration purposes and for the benefit of the sick. Trinity, The Holy – The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (from Latin trinitas “triad”, from trinus “threefold”) defines God as three consubstantial persons, expressions, or hypostases: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit; “one God in three persons”. The three persons are distinct, yet are one “substance, essence or nature”, co-equal, co-eternal and consubstantial, and “each is God, whole and entire” while distinct from one another in their relations of origin: The Father generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father. Accordingly, the whole work of creation and grace is seen as a single operation common to all three divine persons, in which each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity, so that all things are “from the Father”, “through the Son” and “in the Holy Spirit”. Tridentine Mass Rite – the Roman Rite Mass which appears in typical editions of the Roman Missal published from 1570 to 1962. The most widely used Mass liturgy in the world until the introduction of the Mass of Paul VI in 1969, it is celebrated in Liturgical Latin. “Tridentine” is derived from the Latin Tridentinus, “related to the city of Tridentum” (modern-day Trent, Italy). In response to a decision of the Council of Trent Pope Pius V promulgated the 1570 Roman Missal, making it mandatory throughout the Western Church, except in places and religious orders with missals from before 1370. Other names used include Traditional Mass and Latin Mass, although the revised form of the Mass that replaced it has its official text in Latin and is sometimes celebrated in that language. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI issued the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, accompanied by a letter to the world’s bishops authorizing use of the Tridentine Mass and Ritual for competent priests. The Pope stated that the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal is to be considered an “extraordinary form” (forma extraordinaria) of the Roman Rite, of which the Missal as revised by Pope Paul VI in 1970 is the ordinary, normal or standard form. Since that is the only authorized extraordinary form, some refer to the 1962 Tridentine Mass as “the extraordinary form” of the Mass The 1962 Tridentine Mass is sometimes referred to as the “usus antiquior” (older use) or “forma antiquior” (older form), to differentiate it from the newer form of the Roman Rite in use since 1970, again in the sense of being the only one of the older forms for which authorization has been granted. Vatican, the – refers to: The Holy See, the central governing body of the Catholic Church and sovereign entity recognized by international law, consisting of the Pope and the Roman Curia. (c/f Vatican City below, Holy See above) Vatican Apostolic Library – (Latin: Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana), is located in Vatican City. Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It currently has 75,000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1.1 million printed books. The Vatican Library is also a research library  for history, law, philosophy, science and theology. The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail. In March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four-year project of digitalising a collection of manuscripts, to be made available online. Vatican Secret Archives – were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century; they contain about 150,000 items. Some believe they house evidence of extraterrestrial life forms, or ancient texts disproving the existence of Jesus or dark truths that would discredit or destroy the church but alas nothing so dramatic.They contain records chronicling intriguing historical local, national and international events. The ‘secrecy’ is more acurately translated as ‘personal’ or ‘private’ rather than ‘public’ letters. The library has not been secret since 1881 when Pope Leo XIII opened them to scholars of history projects. Vatican Publishing House, the publisher of official documents of the Holy See, separated from the Vatican Library in 1926. Vatican City – the city-state ruled by the Pope, in existence since 1929, on the Vatican Hill in Rome, and which includes St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums. Vatican Hill – One of the hills in Rome, after which the Vatican is named, on the opposite side of the Tiber from the traditional seven hills of Rome. Vatican Basilica – St. Peter’s Basilica, also known as the principal church on the Vatican Hill Vatican Museums –  (Italian: Musei Vaticani) are the museums of the Vatican City and are located within the city’s boundaries. They contain cultural wealth of the Vatican and display works from the immense collection built up by the Popes throughout the centuries including some of the most renowned classical sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the world e.g. The Sistine Chapel with its ceiling decorated by Michelangelo and the Stanze di Raffaello decorated by Raphael are on the visitor route through the 54 galeries of the Vatican Museums. In 2013, they were visited by 6 million people, which combined makes it is one of the largest museums in the world and the 6th most visited art museum in the world. Venerable – In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, after a deceased Catholic has been declared a Servant of God by a bishop and proposed for beatification by the Pope, such a servant of God may next be declared venerable (“heroic in virtue”) during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint. Before a person is considered to be venerable, that person must be declared as such by a proclamation, approved by the Pope, of having lived a life that was “heroic in virtue”, the virtues being the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. The next steps are beatification, from which point the person is referred to as The Blessed, and finally canonization, from which point he is referred to as Saint. For example, Popes Pius XII and John Paul II were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009 and John Paul II was declared saint in 2014 Vestments, Church – liturgical garments and articles associated primarily with the Christian religion, especially among the Eastern Orthodox, Catholics (Latin Church and others), Anglicans, and Lutherans. e.g copes, albs, cotas, humeral veils, stoles, cinctures, amices, chasubles, dalmatics, epicopal gloves, mitres, palliums, zucchettos. Vicar of Christ – (from Latin Vicarius Christi) is the term used in different ways. As the original notion a vicar is of “earthly representative of God or Christ” but also used in sense of “person acting as parish priest in place of ordinary one.” The title is regularly used  to refer to the bishops and more specifically to the Bishop of Rome (the pope. The first record of the concept of the Vicar of Christ is mentioned in the Epistle to the Magnesians of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, a disciple of John the Apostle, probably commanded by Saint Peter, with a pastoral sense, written between the years 88 and 107 AD “your bishop presides in the place of God (…)”. Vices – Vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful, criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, or degrading. They are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth. There is a parallel tradition of seven virtues. Virtues- the seven Christian virtues or heavenly virtues refers to the union of two sets of virtues: the four cardinal virtues, from ancient Greek philosophy, prudence, justice, temperance (restraint), and courage and the three theological virtues, are faith, hope, and charity (or love). Wisdom, gift of – the ability to judge rightly in matters relating to life and conduct; it involves soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends; thinking and acting using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight.  Wisdom As a virtue, it is a habit or disposition to perform the action with the highest degree of adequacy under any given circumstance, and to avoid wrongdoing. This implies a possession of knowledge, an understanding of people, objects, events, situations, and the willingness as well as the ability to apply perception, judgement, and action in keeping with the understanding of what is the optimal course of action. It often requires control of one’s emotional reactions (the “passions”)  so that the universal principle of reason prevails to determine one’s action. In short, wisdom is a disposition to find the truth coupled with an optimum judgement as to what actions should be taken. World Meeting of Families  – takes place every three years, and is coordinated by the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Laity, Family and Life.  Established by Pope Saint John Paul II in 1992 as a pastoral initiative, its aim is to strengthen the sacred bonds of the family unit across the globe.  The first World Meeting of Families took place in Rome in 1994, the International Year of the Family.  Every three years since 1994, families from all over the world are invited by the Holy Father to attend this global gathering.  During a World Meeting, families come together to share experiences, to dialogue, to pray and work together to grow as individuals and as family units.  Delegates participate in discussion groups on the role of the Christian family in the Church and society, and are addressed by distinguished speakers.  The eighth and most recent World Meeting took place in Philadelphia in September 2015. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, in you we contemplate the splendour of true love; to you we turn with trust. Holy Family of Nazareth, grant that our families too may be places of communion and prayer, authentic schools of the Gospel and small domestic churches. Holy Family of Nazareth, may families never again experience violence, rejection and division; may all who have been hurt or scandalized find ready comfort and healing. Holy Family of Nazareth, make us once more mindful of the sacredness and inviolability of the family, and its beauty in God’s plan. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, graciously hear our prayer. Amen.","The Rosary ( Latin : rosarium , in the sense of ""crown of roses"" or ""garland of roses"", usually in the form of the Dominican Rosary , is a form of prayer used especially in the Catholic Church named for the string of prayer beads used to count the component prayers. When used of the form of prayer, the word is usually capitalized (""the Rosary""), as is customary for other names of prayers, such as ""the Lord's Prayer "", ""the Hail Mary "", ""the Magnificat "". When referring to the beads, it is normally written with a lower-case initial (""a rosary""). The prayers that essentially compose the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys with each set preceded by one Lord's Prayer and followed by one Glory Be . During recitation of each set, known as a decade, thought is given to one of the Mysteries of the Rosary , which recall events in the lives of Jesus and Mary . Normally, five decades are recited in a session. Other prayers are sometimes added after each decade (in particular, the Fátima Prayer ) and before (in particular, the Apostles' Creed ), and after (in particular, the Hail, Holy Queen ) the five decades taken as a whole. The rosary as a material object is an aid towards saying these prayers in the proper sequence. A standard fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary, based on the long-standing custom, was established by Pope Pius V in the 16th century, grouping the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. In 2002 Pope John Paul II suggested a new optional set of five, called the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to twenty. For over four centuries, the rosary has been promoted by several popes as part of the veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism . The rosary also represents the Roman Catholic emphasis on ""participation in the life of Mary, whose focus was Christ"", and the Mariological theme ""to Christ through Mary"", taught by Saint Louis de Montfort . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall receive signal graces.

The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of people from the love of the world and its vanities, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying themselves to the consideration of its Sacred Mysteries shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise them in His justice, they shall not perish by an unprovided death; if they be just, they shall remain in the grace of God, and become worthy of eternal life. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plentitude of His graces; at the moment of death they shall participate in the merits of the Saints in Paradise. I shall deliver from purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire celestial court during their life and at the hour of death.

The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has added his voice to Pope Francis’s call to the faithful to pray the Holy Rosary every day during the month of October. Archbishop Eamon Martin of Armagh said that Ireland has a long tradition and devotion to praying the Rosary within the family. The Archbishop was speaking from speaking from Rome, where he is attending the Synod on Young People, Faith and Vocational Discernment. “It is a beautiful prayer but there are often misconceptions about the Rosary because it is quite repetitive,” he said. “In every decade of the Rosary we contemplate a different aspect of the life, death and Resurrection of Jesus. I always encourage people to place themselves into the scene of the particular decade as you pray, imagining the feeling and emotions that Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and others experienced during the actual events highlighting Our Lord’s ministry.” Archbishop Martin pointed out that in Ireland and in more than 40 other countries across the globe, people were gathering at coastal and border locations to recite the Rosary together for Life and for Faith. Organisers of the international Rosary on the Coast initiative described it as an attempt to form “a Holy League of Nations”. As reported last week by CatholicIreland.Net, as well as calling for daily recitation of the Rosary this month, Pope Francis is asking that the faithful conclude their recitations with two special prayers. The first is to Our Lady, Sub tuum praesidium: “We fly to thy protection, O Holy Mother of God. Do not despise our petitions in our necessities, but deliver us always from all dangers, O Glorious and Blessed Virgin.” The second is a prayer to St Michael the Archangel: “Saint Michael Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; may God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl through the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.” During the recitation of each decade of the Rosary – comprising the Lord’s Prayer, ten Hail Marys and a Glory Be – Catholics focus on Mysteries, or elements of the life of Our Lord and Our Lady. Since the time of Pope Pius V in the 16th century, there were 15 Mysteries grouped into three sets – the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries and the Glorious Mysteries. However, in 2002 Pope John Paul II added a new set of five mysteries, the Luminous Mysteries. Often, when people recite the Rosary, they offer particular intentions before each decade to ask Our Lady to grant a favour, said Archbishop Martin. These intentions may be to heal a sick person or convert a sinner, to help and guide in times of trouble, illness, financial difficulties, seeking employment or to ask for her help when studying for exams. The Archbishop said intentions are as varied as the people who pray. “Our Lady loves the prayer of the Rosary. She wants to hear and grant our petitions and requests. “Especially in this month of the Holy Rosary, we can join in communion and in penitence, as the people of God, in asking Our Lady and Saint Michael the Archangel to protect the Church from the devil and in the struggle against evil. I encourage members of the faithful to visit their local grotto or shrine to Our Lady during the month of the Rosary.” Sunday, 7 October was the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.","October is the month devoted to the Holy Rosary. This is the perfect time for us to reflect upon the meaning of the Rosary and its significance in our walk of faith. The Rosary is taken from the Latin word “rosarium” which means “crown of roses” or “garland of roses.” To us members of the Catholic Faith, the Rosary is a form of prayer that we use along with its namesake prayer beads. When referring to the prayer, the word Rosary is usually capitalized and when talking about the beads, the lower-case form is used. According to pious tradition, the idea of the Rosary was given to Saint Dominic when the Virgin Mary appeared to him in an apparition in the year 1214. This Marian apparition is given the title of Our Lady of the Rosary. The Dominican priest and theologian Alanus de Rupe promoted the practice of the Rosary by establishing the “fifteen rosary promises” and founding several rosary confraternities. Devotion to the Rosary is one of the most distinguishable features of popular Catholic spirituality. The Rosary inspires us to meditate on the mysteries of the lives of Jesus and Mary. Meditation is an important of our lives as Catholics. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, meditation “engages thought, imagination, emotion and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart and strengthen our will to follow Christ.” The Rosary is a devotion in honor of the Virgin Mary. It is made up of a set number of prayers. At the start of the Rosary are the introductory prayers which are composed of one Apostle’s Creed, one Our Father, three Hail Mary’s and one Glory Be. In the 16th century, Pope Pius V established the standard fifteen Mysteries of the Rosaries which are grouped into three, the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries and the Glorious Mysteries. In 2002, Pope John Paul II added a set of five to the existing fifteen mysteries and these became known as the Luminous Mysteries. Today, the total number of mysteries is twenty. The Joyful Mysteries include the Annunciation (Luke 1:26-38), the Visitation (Luke 1:40-56), the Nativity (Luke 2:6-20), the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:21-39), and the Finding of the child Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:41-51). Then comes the Sorrowful Mysteries include the Agony in the Garden (Matthew 26:36-46), the Scourging (Matt. 27:26), the Crowning with Thorns (Matt. 27:29), the Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17), and the Crucifixion (Luke 23:33-46). The third mystery is Glorious Mysteries which are the Resurrection (Luke 24:1-12), the Ascension (Luke 24:50-51), the Descent of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4), the Assumption of Mary into heaven (Rev. 12), and her Coronation (Rev. 12:1). The Luminous Mysteries include the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, the Wedding at Cana, Jesus’ Proclamation of the Kingdom of God, the Transfiguration and the Institution of the Eucharist. All throughout the history of the Catholic Church, many popes and saints have encouraged praying the Rosary. As we begin to understand and appreciate the Rosary and pray it more frequently, we come to see the true meaning of its meditations. We begin to appreciate how its prayers are reminders not only of Mary the Mother of God but of Christ himself. Through Mary, we are led to a closer relationship with her son, Jesus. The Rosary is an invitation for us to present our needs to God and to love Him more. When we recite the twelve prayers that form the decade of the rosary, we need to deeply reflect on the mystery associated with that decade. Simple recitation, whether vocally or in silence, is not enough because we miss the true essence of the prayers. Praying the Rosary therefore is not just simply about reciting prayers. It involves reflecting on the grace of God. Praying is a powerful act that lets us develop and strengthen our relationship with God and the Rosary offers the same beautiful reward. By praying the Rosary, we meditate on the events in the life of Jesus Christ and this lets us know God more. When we are unaware of the meditation aspect of the Rosary, we reduce the prayer to an empty, repetitive and meaningless gesture. In Matthew 6:7, Jesus Christ forbids us to practice prayer in meaningless and repetitive babbles. It is precisely the reflective nature of the Rosary that distinguishes it as a powerful and profound way of praying. Rosaries are not just beads or a prayer that we recite during the month of October. Many spiritual battles have been won because of this symbolic act. Many hearts have been touched and many discouraged people have been uplifted because of the Rosary. How do you plan to celebrate the month of Rosary?

St. Michael School Website St. Michael School Classroom Web page","The Rosary (from Latin rosarium, meaning ""rose garden""[1] or ""garland of roses""[2]) is a popular traditional Roman Catholic devotional practice, which denotes both a set of prayer beads and the devotional prayer itself. The prayers consist of repeated sequences of the Lord's Prayer followed by ten recitations of the Hail Mary and a single recitation of ""Glory Be to the Father""; each of these sequences is known as a decade. The recitation of each decade is accompanied by meditation on one of the Mysteries of the Rosary, which are events in the lives of Jesus Christ and his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary. The traditional 15 Mysteries of the Rosary were finalized by the sixteenth century. The mysteries were grouped into three sets: the joyful mysteries, the glorious mysteries, and the sorrowful mysteries. In 2002, Pope John Paul II announced five new optional mysteries, the luminous mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. Emphasis on the rosary is part of the Roman Catholic focus on Mariology, as exemplified by Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae[3] which builds on the ""total Marian devotion"" pioneered by Saint Louis de Montfort. On the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary is celebrated on October 7. The rosary is sometimes used by other Christians, especially in the Anglican Communion and the Old Catholic Church, and also by some Lutherans. Evangelical Protestants, however, such as Baptists and Presbyterians do not use it and actively discourage their members from using this method of prayer. Many similar prayer practices exist in popular Roman Catholicism, each with its own set of prescribed prayers and its own form of prayer beads, such as the prayer rope in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. These other devotions and their associated beads are usually referred to as ""chaplets."" There are differing views on the history of the rosary. According to Roman Catholic tradition, the rosary was given to Saint Dominic in an apparition by the Blessed Virgin Mary in the year 1214 in the church of Prouille. This Marian apparition received the title of Our Lady of the Rosary.[4] However, most scholarly research suggests a more gradual and organic development of the rosary.[5] Prayers with beads like the rosary may have begun as a practice by the laity to imitate the monastic Liturgy of the Hours, during the course of which the monks prayed the 150 Psalms daily. As many of the laity and even lay monastics could not read, they substituted 150 repetitions of the Our Father (Pater noster in Latin) for the Psalms, sometimes using a cord with knots on it to keep an accurate count.[5] During the middle ages, evidence suggests that both the Our Father and the Hail Mary were recited with prayer beads. In the seventh century, Saint Eligius wrote of using a counting device to keep track of the 150 Hail Marys of the Psalter of Mary.[6] In thirteenth century Paris, four trade guilds existed of prayer bead makers, who were referred to as paternosterers, and the beads were referred to as paternosters, suggesting a continued link between the Our Father (Pater noster in Latin) and the prayer beads.[5] In the twelfth century, the rule of the English anchorites, the Ancrene Wisse, specified how groups of fifty Hail Marys were to be broken into five decades of ten Hail Marys each.[5] Gradually, the Hail Mary came to replace the Our Father as the prayer most associated with beads. Eventually, each decade came to be preceded by an Our Father, which further mirrored the structure of the monastic Liturgy of the Hours. The practice of meditation during the recitation of the Hail Marys can be attributed to Dominic of Prussia (1382-1461), a Carthusian monk.[5] Regardless of the origin of the rosary, it was greatly promoted by the preaching of the Dominican priest Alan de Rupe, who helped to spread the devotion in France, Flanders, and the Netherlands between 1460 and his death in 1475.[7] From the sixteenth to the early twentieth century, the structure of the rosary remained essentially unchanged. There were 15 mysteries, one for each of the 15 decades. In the twentieth century the addition of the ""Fatima Prayer"" to the end of each decade became popular. There were no other changes until 2002 when John Paul II instituted five optional new Luminous Mysteries. A rosary provides a physical method of keeping track of the number of Hail Marys said. The fingers are moved along the beads as the prayers are recited. By not having to keep track of the count mentally, the mind is more able to meditate on the mysteries. A five decade rosary contains five groups of ten beads (a decade), with additional large beads before each decade. The Hail Mary is said on the ten beads within a decade, while the Our Father is said on the large bead before each decade. A new mystery is meditated upon at each of the large beads. Some rosaries, particularly those used by religious orders, contain 15 decades, corresponding to the traditional 15 mysteries of the rosary. Both five and fifteen decade rosaries are attached to a shorter strand, which starts with a crucifix followed by one large, three small, and one large beads before connecting to the rest of the rosary. The recitation of the rosary is started on the short strand, reciting the Apostle's Creed at the crucifix, an Our Father at the first large bead, three Hail Marys on the next three beads, then a Glory be to the Father on the next large bead. The recitation of the decades then follows. Although counting the prayers on a string of beads is customary, the prayers of the rosary do not actually require a set of beads, but can be said using any type of counting device, by counting on one's fingers, or by counting by oneself without any device at all. The beads can be made from wood, bone, glass, crushed flowers, semi-precious stones such as agate, jet, amber, or jasper, or precious materials including coral, crystal, silver, and gold. Rosaries are sometimes made from the seeds of the ""rosary pea"" or ""bead tree."" Today, the vast majority of rosary beads are made of glass, plastic, or wood. Early rosaries were strung on strong thread, often silk, but modern ones are more often made as a series of chain-linked beads. Our Lady's Rosary Makers produce some seven million rosaries annually that are distributed to those in economic and spiritual need.[22] It is especially common for beads to be made of material with some special significance, such as jet from the shrine of Saint James at Santiago de Compostela, or olive seeds from the Garden of Gethsemane. Beads are sometimes made to enclose sacred relics, or drops of holy water. A set of blessed Rosary Beads is a sacramental. In addition to a string of beads the rosary comes in other forms for ease of use. A ring rosary is a finger ring with eleven knobs on it, ten round ones and one crucifix. A rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal as well. The most modern form is the rosary card. A rosary card is either one with a ""handle"" that moves like a slide rule to count the decade, or it has a whole rosary with bumps similar to Braille. Rosary beads are at times used to say Roman Catholic rosary based prayers which do not involve the Hail Mary and the mysteries of the rosary. Examples include the Chaplet of Divine Mercy introduced by Saint Faustina Kowalska and the Rosary of the Holy Wounds introduced by the Venerable Sister Mary Martha Chambon.[23] These prayers often use rosary beads, but their words and format do not correspond to the usual mysteries. Both Saint Faustina Kowalska and the Venerable Sister Mary Martha Chambon attributed these prayers to Jesus as part of their Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus Christ.[24] The recitation of the Rosary is traditionally dedicated to one of three sets of ""Mysteries"" to be said in sequence, one per a day: the Joyful (sometimes Joyous) Mysteries; the Sorrowful Mysteries; and the Glorious Mysteries. Each of these three sets of Mysteries has within it five different themes to be meditated on, one for each decade of ten Hail Marys. Pope John Paul II, in his apostolic letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae (October 2002), recommended an additional set called the Luminous Mysteries (or the ""Mysteries of Light"").[21]Catholic faithful who prefer the original fifteen mysteries point to the belief that the Rosary is Mary's Psalter, containing 150 Hail Marys in its body for the 150 Psalms.[25] The Luminous Mysteries make the total 200, but incorporate Christ's ministry. Many people add a recitation of the Fatima Decade Prayer at the end of each Decade. In the practice of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, they have an additional decade for the intentions of the students or the Blessed Virgin Mary. Rosary is usually prayed in Church during afternoon or evening hours. Many Catholics pray the rosary on their own, when alone. But the rosary is also an old family prayer. This specific family devotion has been supported be several popes including Pope Pius XII in his encyclical Ingruentium Malorum: The custom of the family recitation of the Holy Rosary is a most efficacious means. What a sweet sight - most pleasing to God - when, at eventide, the Christian home resounds with the frequent repetition of praises in honor of the High Queen of Heaven! Then the Rosary, recited in the family, assembled before the image of the Virgin, in an admirable union of hearts, the parents and their children, who come back from their daily work. It unites them piously with those absent and those dead. It links all more tightly in a sweet bond of love, with the most Holy Virgin, who, like a loving mother, in the circle of her children, will be there bestowing upon them an abundance of the gifts of concord and family peace.[30] In Monastic Houses, monks were expected to pray the Divine Office daily in Latin, the liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church. In some Houses, lay brothers who did not understand Latin or who were illiterate were required to say the Lord's Prayer a certain number of times per day while meditating on the Mysteries of the Incarnation of Christ. Since there were 150 Psalms, this could number up to 150 times per day. To count these repetitions, they used beads strung upon a cord and this set of prayer beads became commonly known as a Pater noster, which is the Latin for ""Our Father."" Lay people adopted this practice as a form of popular worship. The Paternoster could be of various lengths, but was often made up of five “decades” of ten beads, which when performed three times made up 150 prayers. Other Paternosters, most notably those used by lay persons, may have had only had 10 beads, and may have also been highly ornamented. As the Rosary (ring of flowers) incorporating the Hail Mary prayer became more common, it was often still referred to as a Paternoster. In 1233, seven of the members of a Florentine Confraternity devoted to the Holy Mother of God were gathered in prayer under the presidency of Alessio Falconieri. According to tradition, Mary appeared and exhorted them to devote themselves to her service, in retirement from the world. They retired to the deserted slopes of Monte Senario near Florence, where they experienced another vision of Mary. There they formed a new Order called the Servants of Mary, or Servites, in recognition of their special manner of venerating Our Lady of Sorrows. The seven-""week"" Servite Rosary is variously called the Servite Chaplet; Rosary of the Seven Dolors of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and the Seven Swords Rosary. A set of introductory prayers for the Servite Rosary was written by Saint Alphonsus Liguori in his book The Glories of Mary.[31] The Irish (specifically the Gaelic-speaking) and their descendants have a tradition of saying 13 Aves rather than ten, in honor of Saint Anthony of Padua, whose feast day is June 13. Also called the St. Anthony Chaplet, its prayers are accompanied by a poem called the Miraculous Responsory or si quideris, written by Saint Bonaventure. In 1263, Saint Bonaventure encouraged liturgical devotion honoring the mystery of The Visitation. The Franciscan Crown, officially established in 1422, consists of seven decades of Hail Marys, each preceded by an Our Father and followed by a Glory Be, and completed by two more Hail Marys after the 7th decade to complete the number 72 which is thought to be the age of Mary at the time of her Assumption. The Crown recalls the seven joys of Mary and how she responded to the grace of God in her life. Franciscans are credited with adding the final words to the Hail Mary: Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners (from the writings of St. Bernardino of Siena) now and at the hour of our death (from the writings of the Servite Fathers and the Roman Breviary). The rosary as prayed by the Birgittine order comprises 7 Our Fathers (to honor the joys and sorrows of the Blessed Virgin), and 63 Hail Marys, one for each (presumed) year of her life before the Assumption. The layout of the beads is a loop containing six decades, together with a short string of beads leading to the crucifix.[32] An example of the Birgittine rosary may be seen depicted on the Statue of the Crowned Virgin in the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes. Religious persecution of Catholics began in England and Ireland under Henry VIII in 1540 and continued until about 1731. During what has been called the Penal Times, death became the common penalty for attending a Mass or harboring a priest. Small, easily hidden Rosaries were used to avoid detection. Sometimes rather than a cross, other symbols of specific meanings were used: These rosaries, especially the smaller ring-type, have since become known as soldiers' rosaries, because they were often taken into battle by soldiers, most notably during World War I. These single-decade Rosary variations can be worn as a ring or carried easily and are still popular. A rosary ring is a ring worn around the finger with 10 indentations and a cross on the surface, representing one decade of a rosary. This is often worn as jewelry, and used through the day. Some ring Rosaries use a small bearing on the inside of the ring to permit easy turning. A finger Rosary is similar to a ring, but is a bit larger. Rosaries like these are used by either rotating or just holding them between a finger and thumb while praying. A hand Rosary is a decade in a complete loop, with one bead separated from ten other beads, this is meant to be carried while walking or running, so as not to entangle the larger type. Credit card-sized Rosaries have also appeared, especially among members of militaries, where holes or bumps represent the prayers and the persons praying move their fingers along the bumps to count prayers. While use of the Roman Catholic rosary has gradually been adopted by many Eastern Catholics, many Eastern Catholic churches have undertaken a campaign of liturgical de-Latinization, removing imported devotions and practices (such as the rosary) that have obscured and replaced traditional and authentic devotions and practices of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Subsequently, the most common prayer used in the Eastern Christian Churches (Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic) is the Jesus Prayer, which makes use of the more ancient prayer rope (chotki), a knotted rope (rather than beads) joined together with a knotted cross. The prayer rope is not as fixed in form as the Western rosary (it may have 10, 33, 50, 100, or 500 knots on it), and it normally makes use of beads only as dividers between sections. The Eastern prayer rope is often divided into decades, but it may also be divided into sections of 25 or some other number, or not divided at all. Among High Church Anglicans, Anglican prayer beads are sometimes used. This set is also known as the ""Anglican Rosary"" or as ""Christian prayer beads,"" the latter term arising from the popularity this set has gained among Christians of various other traditions. Anglican bead sets contain 28 beads in groups of seven called ""weeks,"" with an additional large bead before each. In total, there are 33 beads representing the years of Jesus' life on Earth. A number of Anglicans use the Jesus Prayer, just like the Eastern Christians, but there are no Church-appointed prayers or meditations in the Anglican practice. Some Anglo-Catholics use the traditional Roman Catholic rosary. A recent creation known as the Ecumenical Miracle Rosary uses the same beads as the Roman Catholic rosary but with different prayers and with mysteries which focus on Christ's miracles. Wearing of a Rosary that one actually uses to pray is neither uncommon nor sacrilegious in various Roman Catholic-adherent cultures and was a common practice in the Medieval and Renaissance periods, particularly among religious (monks, nuns, and friars). Rosaries are also worn hanging from or looped over a belt, particularly with some religious habits, pinned to and hanging from a shoulder or neckline, or wrapped around a wrist or arm as a bracelet. Some Christians feel that it is sacrilegious for a non-believer to wear a rosary around the neck. This is especially true in Roman Catholic cultures that have histories of persecution, particularly among the Irish and English Catholics. Because Irish Catholic tradition is often seen as normative in the United States and Canada, this has been the source of some conflict in the past. The Roman Catholic Church states: ""Sacred objects, set aside for divine worship by dedication or blessing, are to be treated with reverence. They are not to be made over to secular or inappropriate use, even though they may belong to private persons""[33]. Thus it is acceptable to wear a rosary if one is doing so to show veneration, however it is not acceptable if one is wearing the rosary irreverently, such as wearing it as a piece of jewelry. Many saints have worn their Rosary around the neck, and in the Secret of the Rosary, it is mentioned that a person put his rosary round his neck to keep devils away from him. Rosaries or rosary-like necklaces are often worn for non-religious purposes as a fashion or jewelry item, and are sold in different variations in popular jewelry and clothing stores. Such ornamental use, especially the wearing of a rosary around the neck, was heavily popularized by singer Madonna in the early 1980s and has experienced a come-back in recent years. Wearing a rosary around the neck can be considered disrespectful if the person wearing it does not affiliate with the Christian religion. Ornate or medieval-style rosary sets are occasionally featured in ""goth"" fashion. The rosary has been featured in the writings of Roman Catholic figures from saints to popes and continues to be mentioned in reported Marian apparitions, with a number of promises attributed to the power of the rosary. In the eighteenth century, the French priest Louis de Montfort elaborated on the importance of the rosary and its power in his widely read book the Secret of the Rosary.[36] He emphasized the power of the rosary and provided specific instructions on how it should be prayed, e.g. with attention, devotion and modesty (reverence), with reflective pauses [37] between the beads and smaller pauses between phrases of the prayers.

is limited slip differential the same as traction control,"The main advantage of a limited-slip differential is demonstrated by considering the case of a standard (or ""open"") differential in off-roading or snow situations where one wheel begins to slip. In such a case with a standard differential, the slipping or non-contacting wheel will receive the majority of the power (in the form of low-torque, high rpm rotation), while the contacting wheel will remain stationary with respect to the ground. The torque transmitted by an open differential will always be equal at both wheels; if one tire is on a slippery surface, the supplied torque will easily overcome the available traction at a very low number. For example, the right tire might begin to spin as soon as 70 N ⋅ m (50 lb ⋅ ft) of torque is placed on it, since it is on an icy surface. Since the same amount of torque is always felt at both wheels, regardless of the speed which they are turning, this means that the wheel with traction cannot receive more than 70 Nm of torque either, which is far less than is required to move the vehicle. Meanwhile, the tire on the slippery surface will simply spin, absorbing all of the actual power output (which is a function of torque provided over time), even though both wheels are provided the same (very low) amount of torque. In this situation, a limited-slip differential prevents excessive power from being allocated to one wheel, and so keeps both wheels in powered rotation, ensuring that the traction will not be limited to the wheel which can handle the minimum amount of power. The advantages of LSD in high-power, rear wheel drive automobiles were demonstrated during the United States ""Muscle-Car"" era from the mid 1960s through the early 1970s. Cars of this era normally were rear wheel drive and did not feature independent suspension for the rear tires (but instead used a live axle). With a live axle, when high torque is applied through the differential, the traction on the right rear tire is lower as the axle naturally wants to turn with the torsion of the drive shaft (but is held stationary by being mounted to the vehicle frame). This coined the term ""one wheel peel"". As such, ""Muscle-Cars"" with LSD or ""posi"" (positraction) were at a distinct advantage to their wheel-spinning counterparts.","You have not viewed any items recently.

Painting by Gustav Klimt: Judith and the Head of Holofernes (also known as Judith I) depicts the biblical character of Judith holding the severed head of Holofernes.  Judith I reveals a curious symbolic and compositional consonance with The Sin by Franz Stuck: the temptation illustrated by the German painter becomes the model for Klimt's femme fatale by suggesting the posture of the disrobed and evanescent body as focal piece of the canvas, as well as the facial set. Judith's force originates from the close-up and the solidity of posture, rendered by the orthogonal projection of lines: to the body's verticality (and that of Holofernes') corresponds to the horizontal parallels in the lower margin: those of the arm, the shoulders joined by the collier, and finally the hair base.

Painting by Pablo Picasso: The Old Guitarist depicts an old, blind, haggard man with threadbare clothing weakly hunched over his guitar, playing in the streets of Barcelona, Spain. It is currently on display in the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection.  At the time of The Old Guitarist's creation, Modernism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Symbolism had merged and created an overall movement called Expressionism which greatly influenced Picasso's style. Furthermore, El Greco, Picasso's poor standard of living, and the suicide of a dear friend influenced Picasso's style at the time which came to be known as his Blue Period.

Luxe, Calme et Volupté was painted by artist called Matisse in 1904, after a summer spent working in St. Tropez on the French Riviera alongside the neo-Impressionist painters Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac. Painting by Maxfield Parrish: The Dinky Bird, an illustration from Poems of Childhood exemplifies Parrish's characteristic use of androgynous figures.  To a modern eye, Parrish's early work — characterized by himself as ""girls on rocks"" — may bring to mind the words kitsch or schlock or schmaltz or maudlin, but to many who were enduring the Great Depression or World War II, his images, like  Busby Berkeley musicals, inspired a bit of hope — an imagining that things did not always have to be this bad. During those hard times, many a lower middle class American living room had one or more cheap Parrish prints, sometimes just a page from a magazine, adorning the wall. Albert Einstein proposes the special theory of relativity (E=mc2). Painting by Gustav Klimt: Margaret ""Gretl"" Stonborough-Wittgenstein. Stonborough-Wittgenstein, a member of the prominent and wealthy Viennese Wittgenstein family, was a sister of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the pianist Paul Wittgenstein. She was the subject of a portrait painted for her wedding by the artist Gustav Klimt (Stonborough-Wittgenstein and other members of the Wittgenstein family were among Klimt's most important patrons), which was sold in 1960 by her son Thomas and may now be seen in the Neue Pinakothek gallery in Munich.  Aside: The painting  appears briefly behind Ava, an AI robot, in the film Ex Machina  (a film that is an excellent exploration of artificial intelligence, the nature of consciousness, and passing a Turing Test). Painting by Henri Matisse: Woman with a Hat (La femme au chapeau) depicts Matisse's wife, Amelie. It was painted in 1905 and exhibited at the Salon d'Automne during the fall of the same year, along with works by André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck and several other artists known as ""Fauves"".  Woman with a Hat was at the center of the controversy that led to the term Fauvism. It was also a painting that marked a stylistic shift in the work of Matisse from the Divisionist brushstrokes of his earlier work to a more expressive style. Its loose brushwork and ""unfinished"" quality shocking viewers as much as its vivid, non-naturalistic colors.  Although the Fauve works on display were condemned by many — ""A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public"", declared the critic Camille Mauclair — they also gained some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat. painting by Henri Matisse: Le bonheur de vivre (The Joy of Life) is (along with Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon) regarded as one of the pillars of early modernism. The monumental canvas was first exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial distortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage.  ""The work is known to have invigorated fellow artists, especially Pablo Picasso, who, in an effort to outdo Matisse in terms of shock value, immediately began work on his watershed Les Demoiselles D'Avignon,"" writes Martha Lucy, associate curator at the Barnes Foundation. Painting by Gustav Klimt : The Kiss (Lovers) was painted by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt between 1907 and 1908, the highpoint of his ""Golden Period"", when he painted a number of works in a similar gilded style. A perfect square, the canvas depicts a couple embracing, their bodies entwined in elaborate robes decorated in a style influenced by both linear constructs of the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. The work is composed of oil paint with applied layers of gold leaf, an aspect that gives it its strikingly modern, yet evocative appearance. The painting is now in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere palace, Vienna, and is widely considered a masterpiece of the early modern period. It is a symbol of Vienna Jugendstil—Viennese Art Nouveau—and is considered Klimt's most popular work Painting by Gustav Klimt:  Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) was completed between 1903 and 1907. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Jewish banker and sugar producer. It is the final and most fully representative work of Klimt's golden phase. The portrait was the first of two depictions of Adele by Klimt — the second was completed in 1912; these were two of several works by the artist that the family owned. Adele died in 1925; her will asked that the artworks by Klimt were to be left to the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, although these belonged to Ferdinand, not her. Painting by Ivan Grohar: The Sower (Slovene: Sejalec), is an image of a peasant sowing seeds on a ploughed field in an early and foggy morning. A hayrack, typical of the Slovene landscape, stands in the back, and even farther, the rocks of the small hill Kamnitnik near Škofja Loka. It has been a metaphor for the 19th-century myth of Slovenes as a vigorous nation in front of an unclear destiny, a symbol for the Slovene nation that sows in order that it could harvest, and a depiction of human interrelatedness with the nature. It is also a reflection of the context of Slovene transition from a rural to an urban culture. It has become one of the most characteristic and established Slovene creations in visual arts. Painting by Pablo Picasso: Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, and originally titled The Brothel of Avignon)  portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d'Avinyó (Avinyó Street) in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine.  In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This proto-Cubist work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both Cubism and Modern art. Les Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke, yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 Bathers with a Turtle. Braque too initially disliked the painting, yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And effectively, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the Cubist revolution Henri Matisse coins the term ""Cubism"" — the first Cubist exhibition opens in Paris. Sculpture by Constantin Brâncusi: The Kissis an early example of his proto-cubist style of non-literal representation.  This plaster was exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913. This early plaster sculpture is one of six casts that Brancusi made of the 1907–08 The Kiss.  The original stone carving is in the Muzeul de Arta at Craiova, Romania.  Brâncusi created many versions of The Kiss, further simplifying geometric forms and sparse objects in each version, tending each time further toward abstraction. His abstract style emphasizes simple geometrical lines that balance forms inherent in his materials with the symbolic allusions of representational art. Here, the shape of the original block of material is maintained. Painting by Georges Braque: Houses at l'Estaque (French: Maisons à l'Estaque) is considered either an important Proto-Cubist landscape or the first Cubist landscape. The painting prompted art critic Louis Vauxcelles to mock it as being composed of cubes which led to the name of the movement.  This painting by Braque was refused at the Salon d'Automne in 1908. Louis Vauxcelles recounted how Matisse told him at the time, ""Braque has just sent in [to the 1908 Salon d'Automne] a painting made of little cubes"". The critic Charles Morice relayed Matisse's words and spoke of Braque's little cubes.  The motif of the viaduct at l'Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective. Six landscapes painted at L'Estaque signed Georges Braque were presented to the Jury of the Salon d'Automne: Guérin, Marquet, Rouault and Matisse rejected Braque's entire submission. Guérin and Marquet elected to keep two in play. Braque withdrew the two in protest, placing the blame on Matisse. Painting by Henri Matisse: Dance (La Danse). The title refers to either of two related paintings made between 1909 and 1910. The first, preliminary version is Matisse's study for the second version. The composition or arrangement of dancing figures is reminiscent of Blake's watercolour  ""Oberon, Titania and Puck with fairies dancing"" from 1786.

If you know me at all, you know I LOVE art! So when I walked into my daughter’s school and saw dozens of HUGE recreations of famous pieces of art painted by the students, I was so giddy. I only took photos of a few of the pieces of art, but there were literally dozens and dozens lining the walls. They were huge too – like, floor to ceiling huge. I should have taken a picture with my daughter next to one. I think they projected the images onto the paper and then each group got to paint theirs. Without further adieu, today is art appreciation day at House of Hepworths. Enjoy! We’ll start with my favorite piece of art – The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gough. I have loved this painting since I was a kid. I remember once, when I was about 14, we took a vacation and ended up at an Observatory… McDonald Observatory maybe? Anyway, I bought a poster of The Starry Night and it hung in my room until I grew up and moved out. “The Starry Night was created by Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. It is regarded as among Van Gogh’s finest works, and is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture. “In the aftermath of the December 23, 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear, Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the asylum on May 8, 1889. During his time in the asylum, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises, the blue self-portrait, and The Starry Night.” Source An American Classic, American Gothic by Grant Wood is one of the most recognized, copied, and  widely parodied paintings in American pop culture. “American Gothic is a painting by Grant Wood in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood’s inspiration came from the American Gothic House, and his decision to paint the house along with “the kind of people I fancied should live in that house.” Created in 1930, it depicts a farmer standing beside a woman that has been interpreted to be either his wife or his daughter. The figures were modeled by Wood’s sister, Nan Wood Graham, and Wood and Graham’s dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby. The woman is dressed in a colonial print apron evoking 19th-century Americana, and the man is holding a pitchfork. The plants on the porch of the house are mother-in-law’s tongue and beefsteak begonia, which are the same plants as in Wood’s 1929 portrait of his mother, Woman with Plants. “In August 1930, Grant Wood drove around Eldon, Iowa and noticed a small white house built in the Carpenter Gothic architectural style. Wood “thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house.” At the time, Wood classified it as one of the “cardboardy frame houses on Iowa farms” and considered it “very paintable”. Source Here’s another piece you might recognize… The Son of Man by René Magritte is another classic. “Mr. Magritte painted it as a self-portrait. About the painting, Magritte said: “At least it hides the face partly well, so you have the apparent face, the apple, hiding the visible but hidden, the face of the person. It’s something that happens constantly. Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.” Source The Marilyn Diptych by American pop artist Andy Warhol is another favorite. I’ve loved Andy Warhol for as long as I can remember. I even made my own Warhol inspired art several years ago. “The Marilyn Diptych was painted in 1962 and is a silkscreen painting. The piece is one of the artist’s most noted works, and it has been praised by several cultural critics. “The work was completed during the weeks after Marilyn Monroe’s death in August 1962. It contains fifty images of the actress, which are all based on a single publicity photograph. The diptych is actually fifty pictures; the left half are brightly colored, while the right half are in black and white. It has been suggested that the relation between the left side of the canvas and the right side of the canvas is evocative of the relation between the celebrity’s life and death. “In a December 2, 2004 article in The Guardian, the painting was named the third most influential piece of modern art. The piece is currently on display at the Tate Modern, as part of the exhibition: Witty, Sexy, Gimmicky: Pop 1957-67.” Source When you think of Andy Warhol, you probably immediately think of the Campbell’s Soup Cans. “Campbell’s Soup Cans, sometimes referred to as 32 Campbell’s Soup Cans, is a work of art produced in 1962 by Andy Warhol. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20″ × 16”, and each consisting of a painting of a Campbell’s Soup can; one of each of the canned soup varieties the company offered at the time. Campbell’s Soup Cans’ reliance on themes from popular culture helped to usher in pop art as a major art movement in the United States. “Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol’s reputation grew to the point where he was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist but also the highest-priced living American artist.” Source When I think of my teen years, I had exactly two artists who were my absolute favorite; Van Gogh and M.C. Escher. I was obsessed with M.C. Escher. I had a coffee table book of his work, a t-shirt, and also I would draw hands frequently. I felt so inspired by his mind-altering work. “Drawing Hands is a lithograph by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in January 1948. It depicts a sheet of paper out of which, from wrists that remain flat on the page, two hands rise, facing each other and in the paradoxical act of drawing one another into existence. Although Escher used paradoxes in his works often, this is one of the most obvious examples. “Drawing Hands has been referenced and copied many times by artists in different ways. One common tribute in tech culture is to draw robot hands drawing or building each other or human hands and robot hands drawing each other.” Source When I saw two different M.C. Escher pieces of art depicted on the walls of the middle school, I think I let out an audible squeal. “Sky and Water I is a woodcut print first printed in June 1938. In this central layer of this piece, the elements are equal: birds and fish are alternately foreground or background, depending on whether the eye concentrates on light or dark elements. “According to Escher: “In the horizontal center strip there are birds and fish equivalent to each other. We associate flying with sky, and so for each of the black birds the sky in which it is flying is formed by the four white fish which encircle it. Similarly swimming makes us think of water, and therefore the four black birds that surround a fish become the water in which it swims.” “This print has been used in physics, geology, chemistry, and in psychology for the study of visual perception.” Source If you’ve been in any type of chachki art store, you’ve probably seen some variation of The Scream by Edvard Munch. The Scream is by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch. The work shows a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky. It has been described as “an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time.” “There are four versions of The Scream; two painted and pastel versions. One of the four was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby’s Impressionist and Modern Art auction on May 2, 2012 to financier Leon Black, the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction. “The Scream has been the target of several high-profile art thefts. In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen. It was recovered several months later. In 2004, both The Scream and Madonna were stolen from the Munch Museum, and both were recovered two years later.” Source You might recognize Gustav Klimt by his even more popular piece, The Kiss, although The Lady in Gold is also quite famous. “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) is a painting by Gustav Klimt, completed between 1903 and 1907. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter’s husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer (de), a Jewish banker and sugar producer. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941 and displayed at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere. In 2006, following eight years of effort by the Bloch-Bauer heirs, the painting was returned to the family; it was sold the same year for $135 million, at the time a record price for a painting. “In 1998 Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, established that the Galerie Belvedere contained several works stolen from Jewish owners in the war, and that the gallery had refused to return the art to their original owners, or to acknowledge a theft had taken place. One of Ferdinand’s nieces, Maria Altmann, hired the lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg to make a claim against the gallery for the return of five works by Klimt. After a seven year legal claim, which included a hearing in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, an arbitration committee in Vienna agreed that the painting, and others, had been stolen from the family and that it should be returned to Altmann. It was sold to the businessman and art collector Ronald Lauder, who placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded.” Source Last on our artwork tour, The Book of the Dead is an ancient Egyptian funerary text, based on the Papyrus of Ani. It was created c. 1250 BCE, in the 19th dynasty of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt. “The original Egyptian name for the text is translated as Book of Coming Forth by Day. The book consists of a number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person’s journey through the underworld and into the afterlife. It was written by many priests over a period of about 1000 years. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphics on a papyrus scroll, and often illustrated with vignettes depicting the deceased and their journey into the afterlife.” Source I hope you enjoyed your Art Appreciation Tour today! I wish I could have taken one of these huge paintings done by these kids home with me. They were so so so cool! Do you have any specific favorite pieces of art? What piece, and why?

Thank you. <3 I'm glad you liked it! I loved writing it. So interesting to hear some history about each piece. Have you seen the movie Woman in Gold about the Klimt painting?  It stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds.  It was amazing to watch all they had to go through to get the painting back. The elementary school does an art show every year and among featuring the student’s artwork, there are reproductions of some of these famous paintings.  Some like The Scream and The Mona Lisa, have the faces cut out so you can insert your own face and take a picture.  Love that they are learning about all different types of art. That is so fun! I love that the schools are teaching art appreciation to children. I hope they never cut those programs. Your email address will not be published.

how chapters and verses are in the bible,"The Bible is a compilation of many shorter books written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the biblical canon. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into chapters, generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses-each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of Ephesians 2: 8 -- 9, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of Genesis 1: 2.","The Bible is a compilation of many shorter books written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the biblical canon. All but the shortest of these books have been divided into chapters, generally a page or so in length, since the early 13th century. Since the mid-16th century, each chapter has been further divided into ""verses"" of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of Ephesians 2:8–9, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of Genesis 1:2. As the chapter and verse divisions were not part of the original texts, they form part of the paratext of the Bible. The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.  For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many Psalms are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas the established Christian practice is to treat each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered.  Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. 1 Chronicles 5:27–41 in Hebrew Bibles is numbered as 1 Chronicles 6:1–15 in Christian translations. Bible verse across the street from the United Nations Building. Bible verse from Isaiah writen on a wall across the street from the United Nations Building in New York City The original manuscripts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.  In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs (parashot) that were identified by two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.  Peh פ indicated an ""open"" paragraph that began on a new line, while Samekh ס indicated a ""closed"" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.[1] These two letters begin the Hebrew words open (patuach) and closed (sagoor), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the Book of Isaiah from the Dead Sea Scrolls used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the Masoretic divisions.[2] (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure  certain poetic compositions, known as acrostics, such as several of the Psalms and most of the Book of Lamentations.) The Hebrew Bible was also divided into some larger sections.  In Israel the Torah (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections (Parashat ha-Shavua) so it could be read through in one year.[2]  The New Testament was divided into topical sections known as kephalaia by the fourth century.  Eusebius of Caesarea divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or canons. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions.[3]  (See fuller discussions below.) Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.[4] Archbishop Stephen Langton and Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.[5][6][7] While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them.  Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include John Locke's Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul (1707),[8] Alexander Campbell's The Sacred Writings (1826),[9] Richard Moulton's The Modern Reader's Bible (1907),[10] Ernest Sutherland Bates' The Bible Designed to Be Read as Living Literature (1936),[11] and The Books of the Bible (2007) from the International Bible Society (Biblica). Since at least 916 the Tanakh has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in Masoretic vocalization and cantillation markings. One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the sof passuq, symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the colon (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the Bible into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus's work for the first Hebrew Bible concordance around 1440.[6] The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar Santi Pagnini (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted.[12] His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today.[13] Robert Estienne created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament [14] which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.[13] The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by William Whittingham (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the Geneva Bible published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.  (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language by Eugene H. Peterson.)[15] Most important are the verse endings. According to the Talmudic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin. In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a silluq (which means ""stop""). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a silluq. The Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called parashot, which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a ""closed"" section) or a new line beginning (an ""open"" section). The division of the text reflected in the parashot is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the parashot are not numbered, but some of them have special titles. In early manuscripts (most importantly in Tiberian Masoretic manuscripts, such as the Aleppo codex), an ""open"" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a ""closed"" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed Hebrew Bibles. In this system, the one rule differentiating ""open"" and ""closed"" sections is that ""open"" sections must always start at the beginning of a new line, while ""closed"" sections never start at the beginning of a new line. Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the sedarim. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the quantity of text. For the Torah, this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel. The Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called kephalaia (singular kephalaion, literally meaning heading). This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one kephalaion mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next.  For example, the Sermon on the Mount, comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one kephalaion mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the Gospel of Matthew has several, one per miracle.  Moreover, there were far fewer kephalaia in the Gospel of John than in the Gospel of Mark, even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the kephalaia with their numbers, their standard titles (titloi) and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself. The titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some kephalaia are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next kephalaion begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the Daughter of Jairus and of the healing of the woman with a haemorrhage  gets two marked kephalaia, one titled of the daughter of the synagogue ruler at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled of the woman with the flow of blood where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous kephalaion is thus properly concluded). Thus the kephalaia marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions. Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro is often given credit for first dividing the Latin Vulgate into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal Stephen Langton who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. Robert Estienne (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).[16] The division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study. Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. Biblica published such a version of the NIV in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, Crossway published the ESV Reader's Bible and Bibliotheca published a modified ASV.[17] Projects such as Icthus[18] also exist which strip chapter and verse numbers from existing translations.","With lots of New Year Resolutions floating around, I wonder if any have resolved to dig deeper into the bible this year.  Do you set out with good intentions to read the Bible but get bogged down in the language, such as “he begot this person and that person begot that person” for an example?  I know I have really tried to set my mind to exploring and understanding the bible, but the verbiage gets me at times.  But there’s more to the Bible, and that is where this book comes in! I was actually surprised how this book broke things down.  For example, we all know that the Bible consists of the Old Testament and the New Testament.  We probably all were taught in Sunday School that there are 66 total books of the Bible.  Maybe you even had to recite the books of the Bible like I had to growing up.  Well, this book takes it further in exploring the Old Testament, which goes from creation, through the life of Jewish people, and right on up to the time of Christ.  There are 39 books of the Bible in the Old Testament, with 28 authors writing over a span of two thousand years.  Did you know that?  I didn’t!  Further, the New Testament tells of the birth of Jesus, His life and ministry, and the ministry of His disciples that was carried on after His crucifixion.  There are 27 books of the Bible in the New Testament, with nine authors writing over a span of less than one hundred years. This book goes a step further in explaining the Old Testament, with 17 historical, five poetical, and 17 prophetical books of the Bible.  Likewise, the New Testament is broken down into five historical, 13 Pauline Epistles to the churches, and nine General Epistles. You don’t have to try to absorb ALL of the bible in one sitting.  That’s virtually impossible.  Even if you could read it all in a day, you wouldn’t be able to comprehend it all.  With the aid of this book, however, you will gain more insight and understanding with just taking 15 minutes a day to devote to this cause.  Further, they have fill in the blank areas within the book so you can jog your memory on what you just learned as you go along.  This is done in an effort for you to retain the material later. As I held this book in my hands, the first person I thought of was my father.  Through the years, his faith has really been tested and tried.  He’s gone from being a firm believer, to being on shaky ground after losing his oldest daughter so tragically.  Finally, after years of us praying over him, my dad was able to come to terms with his anger over the loss of his precious daughter and turn back to God.  In doing so, he tried to dive into the Bible to gain further understanding and comfort with the Word of God.  He began praying heartfelt, almost preacher-worthy prayers, which surprised us but comforted us at the same time.  This was the Godly man my heart knew, loved, and remembered from my childhood.  He has returned! Knowing my father’s desire to learn more about the Bible, I presented him with a copy of this book as one of his Christmas gifts this past year.  He held it in his hands looking down at the cover, then slowly started thumbing through the pages.  I could tell it definitely stirred something within his soul, and then he spoke, “I have been wanting to learn more about the Bible, so this is going to really come in handy in the new year.” And my heart smiled.

Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into chapters, generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses – each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to what we have today, rather, they form part of the paratext of the Bible. The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians. For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many Psalms are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered. Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have 1 Chronicles 5:27–41 where Christian translations have 1 Chronicles 6:1–15 The Bible was divided into chapters and verses to help us find Scriptures more quickly and easily. It is much easier to find “John chapter 3, verse 16” than it is to find “for God so loved the world…” In a few places, chapter breaks are poorly placed and as a result divide content that should flow together. Overall, though, the chapter and verse divisions are very helpful. The chapter divisions commonly used today were developed by Stephen Langton, an Archbishop of Canterbury. Langton put the modern chapter divisions into place in around A.D. 1227. The Wycliffe English Bible of 1382 was the first Bible to use this chapter pattern. Since the Wycliffe Bible, nearly all Bible translations have followed Langton’s chapter divisions. The Hebrew Old Testament was divided into verses by a Jewish rabbi by the name of Nathan in A.D. 1448. Robert Estienne, who was also known as Stephanus, was the first to divide the New Testament into standard numbered verses, in 1555. Stephanus essentially used Nathan’s verse divisions for the Old Testament. Since that time, beginning with the Geneva Bible, the chapter and verse divisions employed by Stephanus have been accepted into nearly all the Bible versions.
