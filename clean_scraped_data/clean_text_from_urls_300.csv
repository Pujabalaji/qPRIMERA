when do we say a function is continuous,"In mathematics, a continuous function is a function for which sufficiently small changes in the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output. Otherwise, a function is said to be a discontinuous function. A continuous function with a continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism.",,,,,,,,,,
when did the information age start and end,"The Information Age (also known as the Computer Age, Digital Age, or New Media Age) is a period in human history characterized by the shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based on information computerization. The onset of the Information Age is associated with the Digital Revolution, just as the Industrial Revolution marked the onset of the Industrial Age. The definition of what digital means (or what information means) continues to change over time as new technologies, user devices, methods of interaction with other humans and devices enter the domain of research, development and market launch.","The ONLY authorized website by Dr. Delbert Blair!

It is characterized by a rapid shift from traditional industries, as established during the Industrial Revolution, to an economy centered on information technology.[1] The onset of the Information Age has been linked to the development of the transistor in 1947,[1] the optical amplifier in 1957,[2] and Unix time,[3] which began on January 1, 1970. These technological advances have had a significant impact on the way information is processed and transmitted. According to the United Nations Public Administration Network, the Information Age was formed by capitalizing on computer microminiaturization advances,[4] which led to modernized information systems and internet communications as the driving force of social evolution.[5] Library expansion was calculated in 1945 by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every 16 years where sufficient space made available.[6] He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons and other institutions. Rider did not foresee, however, the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media, whereby vast increases in the rapidity of information growth would be made possible through automated, potentially-lossless digital technologies. Accordingly, Moore's law, formulated around 1965, would calculate that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.[7][8] By the early 1980s, along with improvements in computing power, the proliferation of the smaller and less expensive personal computers allowed for immediate access to information and the ability to share and store it. Connectivity between computers within organizations enabled access to greater amounts of information. The world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes (EB) in 1986 to 15.8 EB in 1993; over 54.5 EB in 2000; and to 295 (optimally compressed) EB in 2007.[9][10] This is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-megabyte (MB) CD-ROM per person in 1986 (539 MB per person); roughly four CD-ROM per person in 1993; twelve CD-ROM per person in the year 2000; and almost sixty-one CD-ROM per person in 2007.[11] It is estimated that the world's capacity to store information has reached 5 zettabytes in 2014,[12] the informational equivalent of 4,500 stacks of printed books from the earth to the sun. The amount of digital data stored appears to be growing approximately exponentially, reminiscent of Moore's law. As such, Kryder's law prescribes that the amount of storage space available appears to be growing approximately exponentially.[13][14][15][8] The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986; 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993; 1.2 (optimally compressed) zettabytes in 2000; and 1.9 zettabytes in 2007, the information equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day.[11] The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986; 471 petabytes in 1993; 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000; and 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, the information equivalent of six newspapers per person per day.[11] In the 1990s, the spread of the Internet caused a sudden leap in access to and ability to share information in businesses and homes globally. A computer that cost $3000 in 1997 would cost $2000 two years later and $1000 the following year, due to the rapid advancement of technology. The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 108 MIPS in 1986, to 4.4 × 109 MIPS in 1993; to 2.9 × 1011 MIPS in 2000; to 6.4 × 1012 MIPS in 2007.[11] An article featured in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution in 2016 reported that:[12] Digital technology has vastly exceeded the cognitive capacity of any single human being and has done so a decade earlier than predicted. In terms of capacity, there are two measures of importance: the number of operations a system can perform and the amount of information that can be stored. The number of synaptic operations per second in a human brain has been estimated to lie between 10^15 and 10^17. While this number is impressive, even in 2007 humanity's general-purpose computers were capable of performing well over 10^18 instructions per second. Estimates suggest that the storage capacity of an individual human brain is about 10^12 bytes. On a per capita basis, this is matched by current digital storage (5x10^21 bytes per 7.2x10^9 people). Genetic code may also be considered part of the information revolution. Now that sequencing has been computerized, genome can be rendered and manipulated as data. This started with DNA sequencing, invented by Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam[16] in 1976-1977 and Frederick Sanger in 1977, grew steadily with the Human Genome Project, initially conceived by Gilbert and finally, the practical applications of sequencing, such as gene testing, after the discovery by Myriad Genetics of the BRCA1 breast cancer gene mutation. Sequence data in Genbank has grown from the 606 genome sequences registered in December 1982 to the 231 million genomes in August 2021. An additional 13 trillion incomplete sequences are registered in the Whole Genome Shotgun submission database as of August 2021. The information contained in these registered sequences has doubled every 18 months.[17] During rare times in human history, there have been periods of innovation that have transformed human life. The Neolithic Age, the Scientific Age and the Industrial Age all, ultimately, induced discontinuous and irreversible changes in the economic, social and cultural elements of the daily life of most people. Traditionally, these epochs have taken place over hundreds, or in the case of the Neolithic Revolution, thousands of years, whereas the Information Age swept to all parts of the globe in just a few years. The reason for its rapid adoption is the rapidly advancing speed of information exchange. Between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic period, humans began to domesticate animals, began to farm grains and to replace stone tools with ones made of metal. These innovations allowed nomadic hunter-gatherers to settle down. Villages formed along the Yangtze River in China in 6,500 B.C., the Nile River region of Africa and in Mesopotamia (Iraq) in 6,000 B.C. Cities emerged between 6,000 B.C. and 3,500 B.C. The development of written communication (cuneiform in Sumeria and hieroglyphs in Egypt in 3,500 B.C. and writing in Egypt in 2,560 B.C. and in Minoa and China around 1,450 B.C.) enabled ideas to be preserved for extended periods to spread extensively. In all, Neolithic developments, augmented by writing as an information tool, laid the groundwork for the advent of civilization. The Scientific Age began in the period between Galileo's 1543 proof that the planets orbit the sun and Newton's publication of the laws of motion and gravity in Principia in 1697. This age of discovery continued through the 18th century, accelerated by widespread use of the moveable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg. The Industrial Age began in Great Britain in 1760 and continued into the mid-19th century. It altered many aspects of life around the world. The invention of machines such as the mechanical textile weaver by Edmund Cartwrite, the rotating shaft steam engine by James Watt and the cotton gin by Eli Whitney, along with processes for mass manufacturing, came to serve the needs of a growing global population. The Industrial Age harnessed steam and waterpower to reduce the dependence on animal and human physical labor as the primary means of production. Thus, the core of the Industrial Revolution was the generation and distribution of energy from coal and water to produce steam and, later in the 20th century, electricity. The Information Age also requires electricity to power the global networks of computers that process and store data. However, what dramatically accelerated the pace of adoption of The Information Age, as compared to previous ones, was the speed by which knowledge could be transferred and pervaded the entire human family in a few short decades. This acceleration came about with the adoptions of a new form of power. Beginning in 1972, engineers devised ways to harness light to convey data through fiber optic cable. Today, light-based optical networking systems at the heart of telecom networks and the Internet span the globe and carry most of the information traffic to and from users and data storage systems. There are different conceptualizations of the Information Age. Some focus on the evolution of information over the ages, distinguishing between the Primary Information Age and the Secondary Information Age. Information in the Primary Information Age was handled by newspapers, radio and television. The Secondary Information Age was developed by the Internet, satellite televisions and mobile phones. The Tertiary Information Age was emerged by media of the Primary Information Age interconnected with media of the Secondary Information Age as presently experienced.[18][19][20] Others classify it in terms of the well-established Schumpeterian long waves or Kondratiev waves. Here authors distinguish three different long-term metaparadigms, each with different long waves. The first focused on the transformation of material, including stone, bronze, and iron. The second, often referred to as industrial revolution, was dedicated to the transformation of energy, including water, steam, electric, and combustion power. Finally, the most recent metaparadigm aims at transforming information. It started out with the proliferation of communication and stored data and has now entered the age of algorithms, which aims at creating automated processes to convert the existing information into actionable knowledge.[21] Eventually, Information and communication technology (ICT)—i.e. computers, computerized machinery, fiber optics, communication satellites, the Internet, and other ICT tools—became a significant part of the world economy, as the development of optical networking and microcomputers greatly changed many businesses and industries.[22][23] Nicholas Negroponte captured the essence of these changes in his 1995 book, Being Digital, in which he discusses the similarities and differences between products made of atoms and products made of bits.[24] The Information Age has affected the workforce in several ways, such as compelling workers to compete in a global job market. One of the most evident concerns is the replacement of human labor by computers that can do their jobs faster and more effectively, thus creating a situation in which individuals who perform tasks that can easily be automated are forced to find employment where their labor is not as disposable.[25] This especially creates issue for those in industrial cities, where solutions typically involve lowering working time, which is often highly resisted. Thus, individuals who lose their jobs may be pressed to move up into joining ""mind workers"" (e.g. engineers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, professors, scientists, executives, journalists, consultants), who are able to compete successfully in the world market and receive (relatively) high wages.[citation needed] Along with automation, jobs traditionally associated with the middle class (e.g. assembly line, data processing, management, and supervision) have also begun to disappear as result of outsourcing.[26] Unable to compete with those in developing countries, production and service workers in post-industrial (i.e. developed) societies either lose their jobs through outsourcing, accept wage cuts, or settle for low-skill, low-wage service jobs.[26] In the past, the economic fate of individuals would be tied to that of their nation's. For example, workers in the United States were once well paid in comparison to those in other countries. With the advent of the Information Age and improvements in communication, this is no longer the case, as workers must now compete in a global job market, whereby wages are less dependent on the success or failure of individual economies.[26] In effectuating a globalized workforce, the internet has just as well allowed for increased opportunity in developing countries, making it possible for workers in such places to provide in-person services, therefore competing directly with their counterparts in other nations. This competitive advantage translates into increased opportunities and higher wages.[27] The Information Age has affected the workforce in that automation and computerization have resulted in higher productivity coupled with net job loss in manufacturing. In the United States, for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%.[28] Although it initially appeared that job loss in the industrial sector might be partially offset by the rapid growth of jobs in information technology, the recession of March 2001 foreshadowed a sharp drop in the number of jobs in the sector. This pattern of decrease in jobs would continue until 2003,[29] and data has shown that, overall, technology creates more jobs than it destroys even in the short run.[30] Industry has become more information-intensive while less labor- and capital-intensive. This has left important implications for the workforce, as workers have become increasingly productive as the value of their labor decreases. For the system of capitalism itself, the value of labor decreases, the value of capital increases. In the classical model, investments in human and financial capital are important predictors of the performance of a new venture.[31] However, as demonstrated by Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, it now seems possible for a group of relatively inexperienced people with limited capital to succeed on a large scale.[32] The Information Age was enabled by technology developed in the Digital Revolution, which was itself enabled by building on the developments of the Technological Revolution. The onset of the Information Age can be associated with the development of transistor technology.[1] The concept of a field-effect transistor was first theorized by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925.[33] The first practical transistor was the point-contact transistor, invented by the engineers Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen while working for William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1947. This was a breakthrough that laid the foundations for modern technology.[1] Shockley's research team also invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1952.[34][33] The most widely used type of transistor is the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1960.[35] The complementary MOS (CMOS) fabrication process was developed by Frank Wanlass and Chih-Tang Sah in 1963.[36] Before the advent of electronics, mechanical computers, like the Analytical Engine in 1837, were designed to provide routine mathematical calculation and simple decision-making capabilities. Military needs during World War II drove development of the first electronic computers, based on vacuum tubes, including the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, Colossus computer, and ENIAC. The invention of the transistor enabled the era of mainframe computers (1950s–1970s), typified by the IBM 360. These large, room-sized computers provided data calculation and manipulation that was much faster than humanly possible, but were expensive to buy and maintain, so were initially limited to a few scientific institutions, large corporations, and government agencies. The germanium integrated circuit (IC) was invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958.[37] The silicon integrated circuit was then invented in 1959 by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor, using the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni, who was in turn building on Mohamed Atalla's silicon surface passivation method developed at Bell Labs in 1957.[38][39] Following the invention of the MOS transistor by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959,[35] the MOS integrated circuit was developed by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962.[40] The silicon-gate MOS IC was later developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968.[41] With the advent of the MOS transistor and the MOS IC, transistor technology rapidly improved, and the ratio of computing power to size increased dramatically, giving direct access to computers to ever smaller groups of people. The first commercial single-chip microprocessor launched in 1971, the Intel 4004, which was developed by Federico Faggin using his silicon-gate MOS IC technology, along with Marcian Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stan Mazor.[42][43] Along with electronic arcade machines and home video game consoles pioneered by Nolan Bushnell in the 1970s, the development of personal computers like the Commodore PET and Apple II (both in 1977) gave individuals access to the computer. But data sharing between individual computers was either non-existent or largely manual, at first using punched cards and magnetic tape, and later floppy disks. The first developments for storing data were initially based on photographs, starting with microphotography in 1851 and then microform in the 1920s, with the ability to store documents on film, making them much more compact. Early information theory and Hamming codes were developed about 1950, but awaited technical innovations in data transmission and storage to be put to full use. Magnetic-core memory was developed from the research of Frederick W. Viehe in 1947 and An Wang at Harvard University in 1949.[44][45] With the advent of the MOS transistor, MOS semiconductor memory was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964.[46][47] In 1967, Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze at Bell Labs described in 1967 how the floating gate of an MOS semiconductor device could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable ROM.[48] Following the invention of flash memory by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in 1980,[49][50] Toshiba commercialized NAND flash memory in 1987.[51][48] Copper wire cables transmitting digital data connected computer terminals and peripherals to mainframes, and special message-sharing systems leading to email, were first developed in the 1960s. Independent computer-to-computer networking began with ARPANET in 1969. This expanded to become the Internet (coined in 1974). Access to the Internet improved with the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991. The capacity expansion from dense wave division multiplexing, optical amplification and optical networking in the mid-1990s led to record data transfer rates. By 2018, optical networks routinely delivered 30.4 terabits/s over a fiber optic pair, the data equivalent of 1.2 million simultaneous 4K HD video streams.[52] MOSFET scaling, the rapid miniaturization of MOSFETs at a rate predicted by Moore's law,[53] led to computers becoming smaller and more powerful, to the point where they could be carried. During the 1980s–1990s, laptops were developed as a form of portable computer, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) could be used while standing or walking. Pagers, widely used by the 1980s, were largely replaced by mobile phones beginning in the late 1990s, providing mobile networking features to some computers. Now commonplace, this technology is extended to digital cameras and other wearable devices. Starting in the late 1990s, tablets and then smartphones combined and extended these abilities of computing, mobility, and information sharing. Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) image sensors, which first began appearing in the late 1960s, led to the transition from analog to digital imaging, and from analog to digital cameras, during the 1980s–1990s. The most common image sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor and the CMOS (complementary MOS) active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor). Electronic paper, which has origins in the 1970s, allows digital information to appear as paper documents. By 1976, there were several firms racing to introduce the first truly successful commercial personal computers. Three machines, the Apple II, PET 2001 and TRS-80 were all released in 1977,[54] becoming the most popular by late 1978.[55] Byte magazine later referred to Commodore, Apple, and Tandy as the ""1977 Trinity"".[56] Also in 1977, Sord Computer Corporation released the Sord M200 Smart Home Computer in Japan.[57] Steve Wozniak (known as ""Woz""), a regular visitor to Homebrew Computer Club meetings, designed the single-board Apple I computer and first demonstrated it there. With specifications in hand and an order for 100 machines at US$500 each from the Byte Shop, Woz and his friend Steve Jobs founded Apple Computer. About 200 of the machines sold before the company announced the Apple II as a complete computer. It had color graphics, a full QWERTY keyboard, and internal slots for expansion, which were mounted in a high quality streamlined plastic case. The monitor and I/O devices were sold separately. The original Apple II operating system was only the built-in BASIC interpreter contained in ROM. Apple DOS was added to support the diskette drive; the last version was ""Apple DOS 3.3"". Its higher price and lack of floating point BASIC, along with a lack of retail distribution sites, caused it to lag in sales behind the other Trinity machines until 1979, when it surpassed the PET. It was again pushed into 4th place when Atari introduced its popular Atari 8-bit systems.[58] Despite slow initial sales, the Apple II's lifetime was about eight years longer than other machines, and so accumulated the highest total sales. By 1985 2.1 million had sold and more than 4 million Apple II's were shipped by the end of its production in 1993.[59] Optical communication plays a crucial role in communication networks. Optical communication provides the transmission backbone for the telecommunications and computer networks that underlie the Internet, the foundation for the Digital Revolution and Information Age. The two core technologies are the optical fiber and light amplification (the optical amplifier). In 1953, Bram van Heel demonstrated image transmission through bundles of optical fibers with a transparent cladding. The same year, Harold Hopkins and Narinder Singh Kapany at Imperial College succeeded in making image-transmitting bundles with over 10,000 optical fibers, and subsequently achieved image transmission through a 75 cm long bundle which combined several thousand fibers. Gordon Gould invented the optical amplifier and the laser, and also established the first optical telecommunications company, Optelecom, to design communication systems. The firm was a co-founder in Ciena Corp., the venture that popularized the optical amplifier with the introduction of the first dense wave division multiplexing system.[60] This massive scale communication technology has emerged as the common basis of all telecommunication networks[61] and, thus, a foundation of the Information Age.[62][63] Manuel Castells captures the significance of the Information Age in The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture when he writes of our global interdependence and the new relationships between economy, state and society, what he calls ""a new society-in-the-making."" He cautions that just because humans have dominated the material world, does not mean that the Information Age is the end of history: ""It is in fact, quite the opposite: history is just beginning, if by history we understand the moment when, after millennia of a prehistoric battle with Nature, first to survive, then to conquer it, our species has reached the level of knowledge and social organization that will allow us to live in a predominantly social world. It is the beginning of a new existence, and indeed the beginning of a new age, The Information Age, marked by the autonomy of culture vis-à-vis the material basis of our existence.""[64] Thomas Chatterton Williams wrote about the dangers of anti-intellectualism in the Information Age in a piece for The Atlantic. Although access to information has never been greater, most information is irrelevant or insubstantial. The Information Age's emphasis on speed over expertise contributes to ""superficial culture in which even the elite will openly disparage as pointless our main repositories for the very best that has been thought.""[65]",An appropriate representation of the requested resource could not be found on this server. This error was generated by Mod_Security.,"As virtually every lucid American knows, Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican candidate for President. In becoming so, he has crafted his own fairy tale of a personal story, defeating sixteen major candidates along the way, many of them GOP heavyweights. When he announced his candidacy a little over a year ago, most people chuckled and presumed he would be relegated to a veritable trash bin of also-rans by the advent of the first couple of primaries. There being no shame in my game, I freely admit, I was one among the collection of most people. However, let the record reflect, I became a believer sooner than most. It is quite possible I watched the progression of the race closer than many people did. In doing so, I noticed what to me was the development of an interesting phenomenon, and it emerged quickly. In his campaign launch, Mr. Trump skewered Mexican immigrants, calling them, among other things drug dealers and rapists, as he offered, upon his personal authority, Mexico does not send us its best. He pledged to build a wall, and not just to erect it, but he insisted that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall. On its face, this seemed to cast Trump’s kickoff as not just inauspicious, but divisive, troubling, and almost certainly, quickly disqualifying. The thing is it did not play out that way. Yes, his strident commentary was a trending topic for a few days. But any great clamor of disgust and disbelief was offset by a populist attaboy that while not rising to the level of groundswell was clearly palpable. Then there was the case of the inconvenient war hero. Donald Trump questioned whether Arizona Senator John McCain, who was held as Prisoner of War (POW) for five and a half years by the North Vietnamese, was a war hero. As Trump put it, “I like people who weren’t captured.” While Senator McCain called on Trump to apologize to military families, particularly those of POW’s, he did not make a point of taking on Trump in a personal frontal assault. Several of the other sixteen candidates did though, perhaps seeing this as an opportunity to make quick work of the upstart Trump. Next up, enter South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who defended his friend’s (Senator McCain) war record, and called Trump’s “antics” the last straw, and the multi-billionaire himself a jackass. Graham laid it all on the line, saying: “I can understand being frustrated about immigration, but there’s no justification to slander a bunch of people that are hardworking folks. This is a line that is crossed. I think the American people, the caucus-goers; the primary voters are going to fix this. To the other candidates, this is your chance to do the right thing and disassociate yourself from somebody who has basically shown a lack of judgment to be commander-in-chief and to be President of us all.” Shortly after Lindsey Gram’s appeal, Trump made a campaign trip to South Carolina. During the rally, in Graham’s home state, he thoroughly dissed the Senator, and topped off his rant by revealing the Senator’s cell phone number to the crowd,  a television audience, and America at large. Among the rest of the GOP field, former Texas Governor Rick Perry answered the call most fervently. He aggressively called out Trump for having attacked Senator McCain’s war hero bona fides. At worst, it was a bad move; at best, it did nothing to bolster his campaign. He could take solace in having stood up and done the right thing. Alas, by shortly after Labor Day he was forced to suspend his campaign. Even though he had significant Super PAC support, he found himself unable to raise sufficient funds through traditional campaigning to keep his run afloat. Donald J. Trump entered the 2016 Presidential race June 16, 2015. Rick Perry exited the race September 11, 2015. Once again 9/11 was a bad day, at least symbolically for Perry and his supporters. More important, in less than three months, I totally re-evaluated my position on Donald Trump and the degree to which he was a player among the Republican field. Before fall, and long before the fist primaries, I argued that Trump was not only for real, but I was certain he had a great shot to be the last person standing when the GOP dust settled. And here he stands. The question now is what, if anything, does he stand for, as he and the GOP approach this month’s Republican National Convention. I have written before about Mr. Trump’s mercurial tendencies as it relates to the issues he supports and defends…or despises and attacks. If you ask Mr. Trump, he might tell you he is famous for his brand, and that his brand is that of a wealthy, successful, did I say wealthy, very wealthy businessman. It is true that Mr. Trump owns and runs lots of businesses, and that he has earned billions of dollars. It is also true that he has lost lots of money, and filed for bankruptcy multiple times; at least four, I believe. But who’s counting? Aside from his self-proclaimed business acumen, his foray into the political arena means its fair game to take a look at his positions on the major policy issues that confront our nation on a daily basis. As commander-in-chief, he will be called upon to navigate, with the help of his cabinet, our great ship of state, through the difficult currents of war, peace, the economy, immigration, and a host of other pressing matters. With that in mind, here are ten issues upon which Mr. Trump zigged and then subsequently zagged: There are plenty more where those came from, including Teleprompters, Hillary Clinton, and building and paying for a wall, of course, just to name a few. Ten is a nice round number though; I’ll stop there. I think that’s enough to make the point, “Word Association: Trump = Quixotic (impulsive and often rashly unpredictable)!” Not exactly what you want in your next President…at least, I hope.

I’ll be the first to admit that is not the way it should be, or would be in a perfect world. Alas, we are not yet there. Roughly two months ago, April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob (Jack) Lew announced, in an open letter to the American people, that the newly redesigned $20 bill would feature abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the front. The $5 and $10 bills are also scheduled for redesign. The $10 note was due to be next in line, because of the need for security upgrades. However, as a result of an extensive 10-month survey and information gathering process, the Secretary was persuaded to leap over the less used $10 bill and move to the $20, a highly used bill that is a staple in ATM’s. Secretary Lew’s determination to put Ms. Tubman on the next $20 bill was precipitated by an overwhelming response from Americans to a poll conducted by the grassroots group, Women on 20’s. Tubman was the first choice over three other contenders, including civil rights icon Rosa Parks, former First Lady and activist Eleanor Roosevelt, and Wilma Mankiller, the first female Chief of the Cherokee Nation. About his decision, Lew said: “I have been particularly struck by the many comments and reactions from children for whom Harriet Tubman is not just a historical figure, but a role model for leadership and participation in our democracy.” Harriet Tubman was a great American shero. Her exploits as a freedom fighter are legendary. Quite naturally, she took her work most seriously. In framing the context in which she viewed the struggle, Tubman once said: “I would fight for liberty so long as my strength lasted.” Fight, she did. She fought to free slaves, and she fought for women’s suffrage. Secretary Lew gleaned through polling, cards and letters, and from his own research that Tubman’s story was one of courage and commitment to equality; one that embodied the ideals of democracy that our nation celebrates. Through placing her portrait on the obverse side of the $20 bill, we will honor her, and continue to value that legacy. The reverse side will still feature the White House and the image of President Andrew Jackson. Lew noted that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing would work closely with the Federal Reserve to speed up work on the new currency. The goal is for all three bills to go into circulation as soon as possible, consistent with security requirements. Well, that seems straight forward enough. Hold up, wait a minute! Just when it appeared that it was possible for the federal government to work smoothly and efficiently to execute the people’s business, we are slapped in the face with the all too familiar reality of an intransigent and obstructionist elected politician. Representative Steve King, Iowa, recently introduced an amendment to bar the Treasury Department from spending any funds to redesign paper money or coin currency. If this amendment were enacted, the Treasury Department’s plans to replace the image of Andrew Jackson with that of Harriet Tubman on the face of the $20 bill would be scuttled. Representative King has not publicly expressed a reason for putting forward the amendment. His office did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. It is probably not news that Ms. Tubman would be the first African American to appear on American currency. While it is disappointing that Congressman King has decided, for reasons he has yet to see fit to share, to intervene and prevent the scheduled updating of our currency, despite existing security issues, I am also compelled to at least note the racial implications of his action. Am I accusing Representative King of acting in a racist manner, or of having racist motivations? No, I am not. I am merely using my powers of observation, which I surely hope are not unique, and noting an apparent (at least to me) nexus between his action, and its evident impact. National media have reported news of his amendment. As such, while you may not have heard about it, the information is implanted in the public domain. I noted in the very first sentence of this post, there is a propensity to throw a stone and hide one’s hand, when it comes to matters of race. But, as I stated then, the assertion that “it’s not about race,” is usually followed by a race-laden subject or discussion. I will not deign to characterize the representative’s motives. Instead, what I will do is point out a few of the individuals and institutions that have gone on record as opposing the placement of Ms. Tubman’s image on the $20. An abbreviated list includes: I’m sure there are others, maybe many, most, likely denizens of the GOP. For now, I will concentrate on those enumerated above. Each of them has invested considerable time, energy, and in the case of the three men, political capital, opposing any and everything even remotely associated with President Obama. Technically that does not include the Tubman initiative, since contrary to the opinion of the typical recalcitrant Obama hater; the decision-making regarding the currency was the purview of Secretary Lew, not President Obama. But, since Lew is an Obama appointee, I’ll play along and blame/credit the President for making the call. Whatever! At this point, if I were engaged in a conversation about this matter, the other party or parties would be offering a litany of thinly veiled-to-totally transparent excuses attempting to defend the non-racial basis for this amendment. On a good day I would listen politely before dismissing the excrement as the half-baked crapola that it is. On a not-so-good day…well, let’s just hope it was a good day. On this day, I’ve done my job. I have elevated the topic so that you may assess and evaluate for yourself.

Before preparing today’s post I decided to make a cursory inventory. At least six times previously, I have written about mass gun violence (in America). In the most recent instance before today I discussed the facts surrounding the June 17, 2015 shooting of the Charleston Nine at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, SC. Just two days shy of a year later, I find myself impelled to beat the drum once more. In an ironic twist, I visited the Mother Emanuel Church this weekend. As I was completing my exercise regimen, a spin bike ride, early Sunday morning, before my trip to Charleston, I read a news story and watched on CNN the story and gory details about the massacre at a gay club in Orlando named Pulse. Each time such a tragedy befalls us; we as a society are diminished. It marks yet another cruel and crushing blow to a nation that I certainly wish to see aspire to emulate its better angels rather than the very worst in our human nature. I have ranted and railed repeatedly about the role easy access to firearms plays in the frequent carnage. I’ve discussed the prevailing politics, examined the NRA and its proxies (lobbyists and Congressmen and women), and lamented the lack of reform. Been there, done that, time and time again. Not today. In honor of those 49 souls who ended their earthly assignment last Sunday morning at Pulse, I will make a brief introduction, and share the powerful words of one survivor.

That completes a listing of biographical summaries of the 49 men and women who lost their lives a Pulse, as shared by CNN. It is without question, their abrupt departure from life, and especially from their friends and loved ones, is a tragedy of incalculable magnitude. I will not even attempt to put that into words. Instead, I will rely upon the insight and heart-rending sentiments of one survivor, Ms. Patience Carter. “Wanting to smile about surviving but not sure if the people around you are ready. As the world mourns, the victims killed and viciously slain, I feel guilty about screaming about my legs in pain. Because I could feel nothing like the other 49 who weren’t so lucky to feel this pain of mine. I never thought in a million years that this could happen.I never thought in a million years that my eyes could witness something so tragic. Looking at the souls leaving the bodies of individuals. Looking at the killer’s machine gun throughout my right peripheral. Looking at the blood and debris covered on everyone’s faces. Looking at the gunman’s feet under the stall as he paces. The guilt of feeling lucky to be alive is heavy. It’s like the weight of the ocean’s walls crushing uncontrolled by levies. It’s like being drug through the grass with a shattered leg and thrown on the back of a Chevy. It’s like being rushed to the hospital and told you’re gonna make it when you laid beside individuals whose lives were brutally taken. The guilt of being alive is heavy.” With that powerful personal testimony, I think it’s all been said. “This Time Orlando: “Pulse” of the Nation!” Read my blog anytime by clicking the link: http://thesphinxofcharlotte.com.

On Monday evening, CNN and the Associated Press declared that Hillary Clinton has crossed the threshold to reach the combined number of Pledged and Super Delegates requited to clinch the Democratic Presidential Nomination. The New York Times added its imprimatur yesterday morning. That was all before taking into account the six Primary contests conducted yesterday in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The candidates are expected to split the 694 available delegates. Next Tuesday, Washington, DC will officially close out the 2016 Primary Election season. Twenty delegates are at stake there. Let me be clear, the quest for determining the Democratic Party’s nominee for President ends “officially” in Philadelphia on July 28th, at the Democratic National Convention. That is an incontrovertible fact. There are expected to be 4,765 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, so a candidate needs a simple majority of 2,383 delegates to win the presidential nomination. However…for all practical purposes, the contest ended Monday evening, when Hillary Rodham Clinton became the Party’s presumptive nominee. Bernie Sanders has done an incredible job with his campaign. He exceeded expectations, most likely, including his own. He engaged youth and Millennials in historic fashion. He has vowed to fight on until the Convention. At the outset, Senator Sanders argued that the country was poorly served by crony Capitalism and the Party’s reliance on big money donors, and its penchant for rewarding the financial industry with bank bailouts, the auto industry with its own bailout, and generally dismissing regular middle class Americans. His message resonated with many Americans and as a result, he built a small donation based Campaign that rivaled the big PACs, in fundraising, and enabled the Senator to take his Campaign through the entire Primary Season in a competitive way. Alas, there was one major problem. Secretary Clinton held her own in the early contests in the Northeast, built a sizable lead in the South, and held on and in some cases expanded her margin as contests moved to the Midwest and the West. As she maintained and/or expanded her lead, the Senator was forced to pivot. He could no longer focused solely on the crony Capitalism argument; he added that the Party electoral process was also corrupt. Since then, the Sanders Campaign has made a huuuuge issue of the Democrat’s Super Delegate process. He and his supporters also skewered the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is a Clinton supporter. Undoubtedly, the next seven weeks will be filled with intrigue and maneuvering as the Clinton and Sanders campaigns navigate and negotiate a truce that in the end must produce something between Détente and a unified Party. The 2016 General Election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 8th, five months from yesterday. You can be sure I will have a lot to say about politics and the election in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, with all due deference to Bernie Sanders for conceiving and constructing an outstanding and an incredibly productive effort, Secretary Clinton has fashioned a lead among Pledged Delegates, among Super Delegates, in the popular vote, and in the number of state contests won. Congratulations to Hillary Rodham Clinton on positioning herself to become the first female Presidential Nominee of a major Party in American History. That highlight was longer than I intended. Let me move directly to addressing the main topic. As a nation, we have become a prickly lot. I’ve written volumes about the notion some Americans label us an Exceptional nation. Indeed, we have amassed many accomplishments that render us distinguished. Yet, I must inject, America has long held a rather high-minded view…of itself. A home team media; a biased political class of powerful elites armed with a self-serving agenda, often crafts this narrative. Regardless of its origin, millions of Americans routinely buy into or co-sign such views. Regardless of the appellation applied to a particular age, whether in this country or others, the name often is intended to convey some positive aspect or attribute of society, or of it’s people. That is as true for the largely European Age of Enlightenment as it is for the current worldwide Information Age. As you may know, the Information Age, also known as the Computer Age, Digital Age, or New Media Age) is a period in human history characterized by the shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based on information computerization. The onset of the Information Age is associated with the Digital Revolution, just as the Industrial Revolution marked the onset of the Industrial Age. I want to momentarily elevate a different kind of Age, the Age of Incivility. In a paradoxical kind of way, President Barack Obama’s critics frequently credit or blame, you decide which is appropriate, him for the rise of incivility in America. While I am inclined to characterize any such attributions as bovine excrement, I do see how, and in select instances why, some folks might feel that way. Donald Trump has been the Presumptive Republican Nominee for President for several weeks now. Mr. Trump bogarted his way to the top of the heap of GOP Presidential candidates by relentlessly attacking his fellow competitors, as well as a host of others, including Mexicans and Muslims. Mr. Trump has vacillated between controversial and flat out toxic, even in his own Party. How controversial/toxic has he been? Just yesterday, Republican Paul Ryan, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, called Trump’s comments on (Kappa Alpha Psi Man) Judge Gonzalo Curiel “indefensible,” “wrong” and “racist.” At a news conference in the Anacostia section of Washington, DC yesterday, with a full complement of African Americans in attendance, Representative Ryan said, “Claiming that a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment.” Trump suggested Curiel could not adjudicate his case without bias because “He is Mexican, and I am building a wall.”   For the record, Judge Curiel was born in Indiana. “No, I’m not – I’m saying that the comment was. I don’t know what’s in his heart, I can’t speak to that whatsoever. What I’m saying is to suggest that a person’s race disqualifies them to do their job is textbook – that’s what I’m saying. I’m not saying what’s in his heart because I don’t know what is in his heart and I don’t think he feels that in his heart but I don’t think it is wise or justifiable to suggest that a person should be disqualified from their job because of their ethnicity.” Despite his frustration, Ryan, who initially declined to endorse Trump said he would still vote for him. This exemplifies the challenge leaders of the GOP face. They appreciate the demographic filters associated with winning the White House. They also know, unquestionably, what it is like to lose two White House bids in a row. I am certainly not going to say Donald Trump cannot be the next President. He does, however, continue to take actions and make statements that exasperate those in his own Party, who possibly want that high office more for him than it often looks as though he wants it for himself. In retrospect, watching and listening to Ryan alternately prod Candidate Trump to be better, tiptoe around inconvenient truths, and dissemble with passion, all in an apparent effort to maintain a shred of credibility, I am reminded of the Biblical admonition found in Matthew 19:14, which advises, “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God.” (–KJV) I think of this passage, not because of Mr. Trump’s wealth, though, as he frequently reminds us, he has done very, very well in amassing a fortune, but rather due to his propensity to spew venomous uncivil statements. To close the metaphor, it appears from my vantage point, it is more difficult for a camel to traverse the eye of a needle than for Paul Ryan and the GOP Establishment to corral and manage TrumpSpeak. Republicans leadership has spent 7 and a half years demonizing and lambasting President Obama. The level of disrespect has been so prevalent. How pervasive and disrespectful has it been? From SC Congressman Joe Wilson’s 2011 “You lie” comment, directed at the President as he addressed a joint session of Congress on various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, to then House Speaker John Boehner’s, Ohio, bypassing the President and issuing an invitation to Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu to address Congress in 2015, to Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton initiating a letter to the leaders of Iran, signed by every Republican Senator except, Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee, Dan Coats of Indiana, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins, of Maine, and Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, also last year. It is because of an innumerable list of reasons like those above that I have noted many times that Trump is effectively the anointed one; the anti-Obama, if you will. Therefore, it becomes a natural progression that the newly minted presumptive Republican Nominee takes off where his recently adopted Party left off. So yes, Obama haters can blame the President as often and as fervently as they like. Just be mindful, calling a pigeon a pimento cheese sandwich doesn’t make it be one. Historically, we like to summon data rather than rely on “a feeling” to underscore the most vital of points. To that end, I submit two studies that suggest support for Trump is highly correlated to concerns about race and ethnicity. In one study, Hamilton College political scientist Philip Klinkner analyzed data the 2016 American National Election Study in a representative sample of 1,200 Americans to compare feelings toward Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. He evaluated the degree to which economic opinions, racial attitudes, and demographic variables predicted an individual’s feelings toward the two. His research showed one factor was much stronger than the others: “My analysis indicates that economic status and attitudes do little to explain support for Donald Trump. Those who express more resentment toward African Americans, those who think the word ‘violent’ describes Muslims well, and those who believe President Obama is a Muslim have much more positive views of trump compared with Clinton.” Moving from the least to the most resentful view of African Americans increases support for Trump by 44 points, those who think Obama is a Muslim (54% of all Republicans) are 24 points more favorable to Trump, and those who think the word “violent” describes Muslims extremely well are about 13 points more pro-Trump than those who think it doesn’t describe them well at all. In the second study, the Washington Post conducted a similar analysis using data from a national poll co-sponsored by ABC News comparing Trump’s support to the other Republican primary candidates. The survey questions asked Republicans and Republican-leaning voters whether they themselves were struggling economically, and whether white people’s troubles were a direct result of “preferences for blacks and Hispanics.” The biggest predictor of Trump support among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters was a belief that “the growing number of newcomers from other countries threatens U.S. values.” Republicans holding this belief felt 18 points more positive toward Trump on a 100-point scale, than Republicans who didn’t feel this way. Belief that Islam encourages violence, and that it’s “bad” for the country that blacks, Latinos and Asians will someday make up the majority of the population, accounted for eight-point jumps in positive feelings toward Trump. In summary, it’s about to go down. It’s up to you to fight, and especially vote to change this dynamic if you believe it’s inappropriate.

You may be familiar with my holiday week philosophy, which is: make it easy on the readers, who are always otherwise engaged, no matter the holiday. Of course, in the process, I am also giving myself a break. That makes for a natural win-win scenario. Memorial Day is a federal holiday, observed the last Monday in May, to honor America’s fallen soldiers. It originated after the Civil War. Falling between Easter and Independence Day, it is often equated with a late spring break, or a pre-summer respite. In fact, many consider it the unofficial first weekend of summer, contrasted with the Labor Day Holiday Weekend, which for many signals the unofficial end of summer. The holiday weekend typically includes a cornucopia of sports. For example Memorial Day 2016 weekend’s events included matches from the  French Open, the NASCAR Coca-Cola 600, a Game 7 in the NBA Conference Finals, College Men’s Baseball playoffs, College Women’s Softball competition, and Championships in Men’s and Women’s Collegiate Lacrosse, coincidentally, both won by teams from the University of North Carolina, among other sports. With the rapidly heating-up political season thrown in the mix, the holiday is sometimes almost lost in the shuffle, especially this year with Donald Trump totally reinventing the GOP Presidential race, and Bernie Sanders fashioning his own brand of revolution in the Democratic Party’s race. But wait; Memorial Day also has a special cultural significance. In fact, it is because of that nexus we should pay special homage to this late spring holiday. The first well-known observance of a Memorial Day type was held May 1, 1865 in Charleston, South Carolina. Over 250 Union soldiers that had been prisoners of war, died in Charleston, and were quickly buried in makeshift graves. A group of blacks, mostly freedmen, organized the observance and led cleanup and landscaping of the burial site. Most of the nearly 10,000 people who attended were freedmen and their families. Of that number, 3.000 were children, newly enrolled in freedman’s schools. Mutual aid societies, black ministers, and white Northern missionaries were also in attendance. David W. Blight, Professor of American History at Yale University, and Director of the school’s Gilder-Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, & Abolition, described the day this way: “This was the first Memorial Day. African Americans invented Memorial Day in Charleston, South Carolina. What you have there is black Americans recently freed from slavery announcing to the world with their flowers, their feet, and their songs what the War had been about. What they basically were creating was the Independence Day of a Second American Revolution.” Professor Blight conceded there is no evidence that the Charleston event led directly to the establishment of Memorial Day across the country. But the record is clear they formed the earliest truly large-scale event, complete with media coverage. Their effort was the prototype, if not the catalyst.

how is the wimbledon court different from that of the other three grand slams,"The Grand Slam tournaments, also called majors, are the four most important annual tennis events. They offer the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and greater number of ""best of"" sets for men.

However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924 -- 25, when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments.

The term Grand Slam also, and originally, refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single calendar year within one of the five events: men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles. In doubles, one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners. The term ""Grand Slam"" without qualification refers to winning the four majors in a single calendar year. Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam, while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam. Winning the gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in addition to the four majors in a one calendar year is known as a ""Golden Grand Slam"" or more commonly the ""Golden Slam"". Also, winning the Year-End Championship in the same period is known as a ""Super Slam"". Together, all four Majors in all three disciplines (singles, doubles, and mixed doubles) are called a ""boxed set"" of Grand Slam titles. No male or female player has won all twelve events in one calendar year however a ""career boxed set"" has been done by three female players during their careers. The term slam for winning all of the tricks in the whist family card games (see also whist terms) is attested from early in the 17th century. Grand slam for all of the tricks, in contrast to small slam or little slam for all but one, dates from early in the 19th century. This use was inherited by contract bridge, a modern development of whist defined in 1925 that became very popular in Britain and America by 1930. Grand slam has been used in golf since 1930, when Bobby Jones won the four major championships, two British and two American. Although John F. Kieran is widely credited with first applying the term ""grand slam"" to tennis, to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year, sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran.

what's the population of chiang mai thailand,"While officially the city (thesaban nakhon, ""city municipality"") of Chiang Mai only covers most parts of the Mueang Chiang Mai District with a population of 160,000, the city's sprawl extends into several neighboring districts. The Chiang Mai metropolitan area has a population of nearly one million people, more than half the total of Chiang Mai Province.","Chiang Mai  is the capital of the northern Provinces of Thailand. Surrounded by lush vegetation and home to hundreds of Temples, Chiang Mai  is an excellent escape from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. A little info on Chiang Mai via our friends at wikipedia.com Chiang Mai (/ˈtʃjɑːŋˈmaɪ/, from Thai: เชียงใหม่  [tɕʰiəŋ màj] ( listen), Lanna: ᨩ᩠ᨿᨦᩉ᩠ᨾᩲ᩵ [t͡ɕīaŋ.màj] ( listen)) sometimes written as “Chiengmai” or “Chiangmai”, is the largest and most culturally significant city in Northern Thailand. It is the capital of Chiang Mai Province and was a former capital of the Kingdom of Lan Na (1296–1768), which became a tributary state of the Kingdom of Chiang Mai from 1774 to 1939. It is 700 km (435 mi) north of Bangkokand is situated amongst the highest mountains in the country. The city sits astride the Ping River, a major tributary of the Chao Phraya River. Chiang Mai means “new city” and was so named because it became the new capital of the Lan Na kingdom when it was founded in 1296, succeeding Chiang Rai, the former capital founded in 1262.[1]:208–209 Chiang Mai gained prominence in the political sphere in May 2006, when the Chiang Mai Initiative was concluded between the ASEAN nations and the “+3” countries (China, Japan, and South Korea). Chiang Mai was one of three Thai cities contending for Thailand’s bid to host the World Expo 2020 (the others were Chonburi and Ayutthaya).[2]Ayutthaya, however, was the city ultimately chosen by the Thai Parliament to register for the international competition.[3][4] Chiang Mai has positioned itself to become a Creative City and is considering applying for Creative City status with UNESCO.[5] Chiang Mai was one of two tourist destinations in Thailand on TripAdvisor‘s 2014 list of “25 Best Destinations in the World”, where it stands at number 24.[6] Chiang Mai’s historic importance is derived from its close proximity to the Ping River and major trading routes.[7][8][9] While officially the city (thesaban nakhon) of Chiang Mai only covers most parts of the Mueang Chiang Mai district with a population of 160,000, the city’s sprawl extends into several neighboring districts. The Chiang Mai Metropolitan Areahas a population of nearly one million people, more than half the total of Chiang Mai Province. The city is subdivided into four wards (khwaeng): Nakhon Ping, Srivijaya, Mengrai, and Kawila. The first three are on the west bank of the Ping River, and Kawila is on the east bank. Nakhon Ping district comprises the north part of the city. Srivijaya, Mengrai, and Kawila consist of the west, south, and east parts, respectively. The city center—within the city walls—is mostly within Srivijaya ward.[10] courtesy of wikipedia We took Thai Air Business class for the quick 1 hour flight to Chiang Mai from Bangkok and arrived pleasantly at around the 1pm hour. It was so nice to leave Bangkok as it was really hot there and were hoping to find a more cool atmosphere in Chiang Mai You can read about our earlier trip to Bangkok another warm welcome by clicking on that link. Chiang Mai International Airport was very small in comparison to BKK and it was most welcoming. We pre-arranged with our hotel, to hire a private driver to help make our transition into the city much more smoothly. Our Hotel Rachamankha is located along the northern walls of the old city. Next to temples or great importance, this hotel was completely built through the imagination and careful study of its English proprietor who modeled the entire complex after traditional Lana style homes. When you first enter Rachankha you swear it is at least 200 years old, never would I have imagined that it was just recently built, and recently visited by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Wow ….. The price is really decent for such a luxurious accommodation. Our room was located on the far side of the property . The room was huge for what we paid for and came with all the amenities one would need while in Chiang Mai,with the most important being , local mosquito repellent, as Dengue fever is prevalent up here in the hills.  You can read my review on the Rachamankha hotel here After checking in and enjoying a nice walk through the beautiful property, we headed out for the day. We started with the first temple, and you must excuse me because I can’t remember any of the many temple’s names. AT ALL … All I know is that it is definitely temple row , as there is temple after temple everywhere. It was HOT!!!!! No different from Bankgok , except for the amount of pollution which was minimal. Our day was uplifting and spiritual as we visited many ancient temples carved out of rock, and participated in the many celebrations going on in the city… We did come across a really interesting museum. A museum dedicated to BUGS. Yes, Bugs… of course I had to see the gigantic centipedes etc. Now I have something else besides the mosquito to worry about. We returned to the hotel, because yet again, my mother was physically exhausted from the heat. So rest was in store. It gave me some time to catch up on writing in my journal. The grounds of the hotel was so peaceful, and I found myself moving all over while writing. From the elegant pool, to the quiet study and library, I was in total peace. Later that evening, starving, we decided to try our luck out in the city for a meal. We walked out to the main road, hoping to catch a cab or tuktuk, but it was taking a while. So much so, that the heavenly rain started to bless my forehead. OMG…. Finally a tuktuk stopped and demanded that if we want to go anywhere I have to pay a flat rate. I don’t him to go Flat rate himself…. The next tuktuk was a nice elderly gentleman who took us to an area, on the meter, where many different restaurants were at. I was drawn to this illuminated red restaurant. Big mistake. The food …. sucked, and sucked the money out of your wallet. Oh well lesson learned. After Dinner ( or lack there of) we took another tuktuk to the night market. The night market is on every type of tourist information on what to do while in Chiang Mai, but I found it extremely boring, and nothing like Bangkok’s open markets. There really wasn’t anything I wanted. Oh well, back to the hotel for a little rest and some Singha Beer. The next morning, we arranged through our hotel , for a private driver to take us touring around Chiang Mai. First stop : Wat Phra That Toi Kham, Temple of the Golden Mount. Our driver dropped us off at the bottom, where you have two options to get to the top of the temple grounds. Climb the 1000 steps that devout devotees climb, or catch a funicular. We opted for the latter. The views were beautiful, as you can can see the lush forests below and the city below the clouds. The air was fresh, and the temple grounds were lovely. We sat and rested and took in all the scenery, as we haven’t really had moments to sit and contemplate and soak the day in. After about an hour, we left the temple and were on our way to Jade , local umbrella makers, and local artifacts shopping. Jade shopping was awesome, and after a few factories, and some really good bargaining, mother and daughter bonded by each getting a solid free jade bangle. Next we went to the amazing umbrella shops. If you’ve ever seen those beautiful paper and bamboo asian umbrellas, know that this is the place to get the absolute best, and we did. Our final shopping stop was at this local factory of lacquer and porcelain artifacts. The craftsmanship was so beautiful, and it was perfect place to pick up gifts. Hungry, we decided to head back to the hotel for lunch, but our driver had a different idea on where we should eat. He took us to a tiny 4 people mom and pop restaurant and posted the best Lana style Thai food in all of Chiang Mai. Boy was he absolutely right! It was delicately delicious! We went back to the hotel for a little rest again. We were goth getting a lot of rest here in Chiang Mai, and it totally helped that our hotel was extremely comfortable. Our  timing was absolutely perfectly in sync to be at our room just in time for a fantastic rain storm. After the sun set, we got ready to go to dinner here at the hotel. Unfortunately when we arrived, it was closed to a private party… Bad planning on our part. So we asked the concierge to please hire us a taxi to take us to a restaurant that they would recommend. Dinner was lovely and very filling. I can’t remember the restaurant we went to all except that it was fabulously delicious. Today was our last day. And after a fabulous breakfast ( included in our hotel price) at the lovely restaurant on property, we decided to go visit ….. The zoo. Our flight wasn’t leaving until 3 pm so we had plenty of time. The Zoo is gigantic and you could spend the entire day there just trying to see everything. It’s so large, that there is a monorail to take you everywhere. We fed elephants and hippos that you could actually touch, enjoyed the many different birds and creatures in the zoo. It was time to head back to the hotel to freshen up, check out, and make our way to the airport. We took a Red Truck Rickshaw called Songthaews, and it was so funny. My mother and I couldn’t stop laughing. You hop into the bed of the truck which is covered by a roof and has a bench on each side, which you share with other passengers. They are crazy drivers, but it was so much fun. Chiang Mai  was such a much-needed rest stop for us. We were in nature, and it was pleasant. We didn’t do much like riding an elephant , which a lot of people do, because I’m completely against it. In fact do yourself a favor and educate yourself on the horror elephants go through trying to carry people on their sensitive backs. There were options to go and volunteer at one of the many sanctuaries outside of the city where you don’t do anything but take care of the elephant, but I was so afraid of my mother catching Dengue Fever, that I opted against it. Next time, when alone, I will definitely be back to go and volunteer my time with the elephants.. I really loved my stay in Chiang Mai and will definitely be back. Thank you for this excellent article once again Erika, On May 5-9, 2016 I will be visiting Chiang Mai and will be staying at Rachamankha.  Im looking forward and excited for my visit because of your writing. Edward you will absolutely love the hotel and Chiang Mai.

A Brit in Bangkok blogging about it all. ✱Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm........➸","Chiang Mai also sometimes written as ""Chiengmai"" or ""Chiangmai"", is the largest and most culturally significant city in Northern Thailand, and the capital of Chiang Mai Province. It is located some 800 km north of Bangkok, among some of the highest mountains in the country. The city stands on the Ping river, a major tributary of the Chao Phraya river. In recent years Chiang Mai has become an increasingly modern city, although it lacks the cosmopolitan gloss of Bangkok. It has many attractions for the thousands of foreign visitors who come to the city each year. Chiang Mai's historic strength derived from its important strategic location near a southern branch of the ancient Silk Road, and long before the modern influx of foreign visitors the city served as an important centre for handcrafted goods, umbrellas, jewellery (particularly silver) and woodcarving. While officially the city of Chiang Mai only covers the Mueang Chiang Mai district with a population of 150,000, the urban sprawl of the city extends into several neighboring district. This Chiang Mai Metropolitan Area has a population of nearly 700,000 people, nearly half of the whole Chiang Mai Province. King Mengrai founded the city of Chiang Mai (meaning ""new city"") in 1296, and it succeeded Chiang Rai as the capital of the Lannathai kingdom. Mengrai constructed a moat and a wall around the city to protect it against raids from Burma. With the decline of the Lannathai kingdom, the city lost importance and often was occupied by either the Burmese or by the Thais from Ayutthaya. As a result of the Burmese wars that culminated in the fall of Ayutthaya in April 1767, Chiang Mai itself was so depopulated that the remaining inhabitants abandoned the city for fifteen years (1776 - 1791). Lampang functioned as the capital of what remained of Lannathai during that time. Chiang Mai formally became part of Siam in 1774, when the Thai King Taksin captured the city from the Burmese. Chiang Mai rose in both cultural, trading and economic terms to gradually adopt its current status as the unofficial capital of the north of Thailand, second only in national importance to Bangkok. The people generally speak Kham Muang (also known as Northern Thai or Lanna) amongst themselves, but the Central Thai of Bangkok is used in education and is understood by most. The old Kham Muang alphabet is now only studied by scholars and Northern Thai is commonly written using the standard Thai alphabet. Chiang Mai has over 300 Buddhist temples (called ""wats"" in Thai). These include Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep: the most famous temple in the area, standing on a hill to the north-west of the city. This temple dates from 1383. Its builders allegedly chose its site by placing a relic of the Lord Buddha on an elephant's back and letting the elephant roam until it came across a place where it trumpeted and circled before lying down. The onlookers took this as marking an auspicious place in which to build the temple. The temple's location also affords superb views over the city on a clear day. Wat Chiang Man: the oldest temple in Chiang Mai. King Mengrai lived here while overseeing the construction of the city. This temple houses two very important and venerated Buddha images - Phra Sila (a marble Buddha) and Phra Satang Man (a crystal Buddha). Wat Phra Singh: located within the city walls, dates from 1345 and offers an example of classic northern Thai style architecture. It houses the Phra Singh Buddha, a highly venerated image, transferred here many years ago from Chiang Rai. Wat Chedi Luang: founded in 1401 and dominated by the large Lanna style chedi which dates from the same time, but took many years to finish building. An earthquake damaged the chedi in the 16th century, so now only two-thirds of it remain. This Wat is directly behind ""The Garden"". Wat Ched Yot: located on the outskirts of the city, this temple, built in 1455, hosted the Eighth World Buddhist Council in 1977. Wiang Kum Kam: the site of an old city situated on the southern outskirts of Chiang Mai. King Mengrai used this city for ten years before the founding of Chiang Mai. The site has a large number of ruined temples. Wat U-Mong: a forest and cave wat in the foothills in the west of the city, near Chiang Mai University. Wat U-Mong is known for its grotesque concrete fasting Buddha image and hundreds of pithy Buddhist proverbs in English and Thai posted on trees throughout its grounds. Wat Suan Dok: a 14th century temple located just west of the old city-wall. The temple was built by the King of Lanna for a revered priest visiting from Sukhothai as a place for the monk to spend the rains retreat. The name of the temple roughly translates to ""field of flowers."" There are several unique aspects to this temple. One is the temple's large ubosot, or ordination hall. The ubosot is unusual not only for its size, but also the fact that it is open on the sides rather than being totally enclosed. Secondly, the large number of chedis housing the cremated remains of the rulers of Chiang Mai. This temple is also the site of one of the most important monastic universities in Thailand, Mahachulalongkorn Rajavidyalaya Buddhist University. Loi Kratong: Held on a full-moon night in November. Every year thousands of people assemble floating banana-leaf containers (krathong) decorated with flowers and candles onto the waterways of the city to worship the Goddess of Water. Lanna-style hot-air lanterns (khom loi) are also launched into the air. These are believed to help rid the locals of troubles and are also taken to decorate houses and streets. Songkran: Held in mid-April to celebrate the traditional Thai new year. Chiang Mai has become one of the most popular locations to visit for this festival. A variety of religious and fun-related activities (notably the good-natured city-wide water-fight) take place each year, along with parades and a Miss Songkran beauty competition. Flower Festival: A three-day festival held during the first weekend in February each year, this event occurs during the period when Chiang Mai's temperate and tropical flowers are in full bloom. The festivities include floral floats, parades, traditional dancing shows and a beauty contest. Chiang Mai has several universities, including Rachapat University, Rajamangala University of Technology, Chiang Mai University, Payap University and Maejo University -- as well as numerous technical and teacher colleges. Hill-tribe tourism and trekking: A large number of different tour companies offer organised treks among the local hills and forests on foot and on elephant back. Most also involve visits to the various local hill tribes. These include representatives from the Akha, Hmong, Karen, and Lisu tribes. Other outdoor activities: The varied local terrain also offers opportunities for mountain biking, elephant riding, bamboo rafting and kayaking. The area also has several golf courses. The nearby national park that includes Doi Inthanon, the highest mountain in Thailand, features many hiking trails. Shopping: Chiang Mai has a large and famous nightly bazaar for arts, handicrafts and counterfeit products of all descriptions, and a number of large, well-appointed modern shopping centres. A major attraction is the Sunday walking street market which takes place on the main street of the old city, Ratchadamnorn road. Selling mostly arts and crafts from the surrounding hill tribes, it also features music and theater. Thai massage: The back streets and main thoroughfares of Chiang Mai have a variety of massage parlours which offer anything from quick, simple, face and foot massages, to month-long courses in the art of Thai massage. Local museums: These include the Chiang Mai City Arts and Cultural Centre, the Hill Tribe Museum and the Chiang Mai National Museum. Chiang Mai is well served by Rail, Bus and Plane transport. The state railway operates around 14 trains a day to Chiang Mai Station from Bangkok. Many journeys run overnight and the journey takes approximately 12 to 15 hours. Most trains offer a first-class service with private cabins, and a second-class service with fold-down sleeping berths. The Central Chang Pheuak terminal provides local services to other locations within Chiang Mai province. The Chiang Mai Arcade terminal, north-east of the city, runs a service several times a day to Bangkok (a 10 to 12 hour journey). This terminal also provides services to over 20 other destinations around Thailand. Chiang Mai International Airport receives up to fifteen flights a day from Bangkok, and also serves as a local hub for services to other Northern cities such as Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son. International services also connect Chiang Mai with other regional centres. Below is a list of some of the airlines that use Chiang Mai international airport.

Many people think that Greenwich Village’s cachet — and the value of its property — comes from its beautiful, landmarked, low-scale buildings, its artistic and intellectual ferment and its numerous attractions, from Washington Square to cafes and cultural spots. But Mayor Bloomberg says simply being close to New York University is a major factor driving property values. Responding to a reporter’s question last month about the university’s 2031 plan, Bloomberg said of the Village, “People there, the value of their homes, the level of their quality of life is due to the proximity of N.Y.U.” He furthermore accused the plan’s opponents of “playing politics with it,” adding that this is “not beneficial to anyone.” Assemblymember Deborah Glick said, sadly, the mayor just doesn’t get it. “Spoken like a man who comes from Boston and lives on the Upper East Side,” she said. “I don’t think he particularly understands New York — he understands a very limited slice of New York. The neighborhood, day-to-day life of New Yorkers is not something that has value for him or his social set. People will be disappointed, but I don’t think they’ll be the least bit surprised,” Glick said of the mayor’s claims that it’s actually N.Y.U. that is elevating everyone’s quality of life. https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/mike-bloomberg-on-people-in-the-village-the-value-of-their-homes-the-level-of-their-quality-of-life-is-due-to-the-proximity-of-n-y-u/ Friday May 4th Monday, May 7 is the deadline for the submission of all written testimony addressed to the City Planning Commission in response to the NYU administration’s ULURP request for its proposed expansion.

Planning Commission Chair Amanda Burden — who has not been overly discerning in her care of our city, and under Bloomberg’s authority, has overseen rezoning after rezoning of neighborhoods in our city (not with good effect) — asked in relation to the concept that the faculty needs to be located within the “super blocks” around Washington Square: “Why can’t they be anyplace else?” NYU Prez John Sexton has made the argument that the University faculty need to be a 10-15 minute walk from the “Washington Square campus” stating (as he always seems to do) that to stay competitive with other Universities, this is necessary. GVSHP has countered this with a document, “The MYTH of the ten minute walk from Washington Square”. As becomes clear, most schools maintain campuses over distances the equivalent of those between Washington Square and the Financial District, and in many cases over considerably greater distances. Further, few if any of these campuses have the wealth of mass transit options that allow travel between Washington Square and a location like the Financial District to take as little as 5 to 10 minutes, and frequently require walking time of much more than 10-15 minutes, as NYU claims is essential. NYU is also beyond resistant to moving further south and expanding more within the Financial District. We know that they overly market their connection to Washington Square – fine – but their flags are already everywhere. The institution is changing the neighborhood, no longer for the better, lending a transient quality, and, also as a landlord, raising rents and kicking out longstanding tenants. https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/nyu-super-expansion-2031-still-time-to-weigh-in-to-city-planning-commission-today/ New York University announced yesterday that it was scaling back its controversial plans for expansion by “almost a fifth.” Wow, now that’s a significant number, you might think, if you didn’t already know how these cynical games are played. The school had originally proposed adding 2.5-million-square feet of dorms, classrooms and commercial space to the two superblocks it owns south of Washington Square Park. A couple of new towers (designed by Toshiko Mori and Grimshaw Architects) were part of the plan. On the face of it, the announcement was in response to local opposition. But this is really a move straight from the developer’s playbook. In honor of the client here, let’s call it “Gamesmanship 101.” Here is how it works: 1) propose a humongous, X-million-square foot project; 2) get predictably hammered by outraged community groups who claim it will ruin the neighborhood; 3) appear to re-group or “go back to the drawing board”; 4) allow a decent interval of time to elapse (you’re busy processing all of the “neighborhood concerns”); and 5) roll out a slightly modified new plan (still too damn big, of course, but not quite as bloated as the original) that appears to be in response to local “input,” but is in fact very close to the internal number you were aiming for all along. Think of it as a high stakes poker game, with numbers and renderings and zoning variances as the chips. You want 2-million square feet of new construction approved in the Village? First ask for 2 and a half million. (Oh, it also doesn’t hurt to have most of the elected officials in your back pocket.) https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/worth-reading-metropolis-mag-the-shell-game-on-nyu-mega-expansion-plan-2031/ Capital NY: Faculty Steps up Opposition (Extensive piece.) https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/12933/ Why does this feel like term limits all over again? The daily papers all supporting an unsustainable and undesired position completely opposite the wishes of most New Yorkers. The billionaire Mayor on the wrong side. Again. And then, all his city agencies – in this case, the Planning Commission and City Council – will inevitably just fall in line. It’s clear that Bloomberg had already expressed behind the scenes his support of the plan. Mike is always in favor of anything that benefits the developers and corporations. And we know that NYU President John Sexton jumped down to City Hall to support granting no limit of Bloomberg’s term in his up-is-down testimony. As I wrote at the time, “More Bloomberg. More NYU.” It’s sort of horrifying – if it wasn’t so real. Hopefully, things can be learned by those issues on which Bloomberg has not “won.” Can someone remind me what those are? I know there have been a few. Westside Stadium, for one. Others? (And when I say “won,” Bloomberg hasn’t really “won” on any of these issues, as much as subverted the democratic process and bought influence somehow – it’s never a “fair” fight.) https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/surprise-mayor-michael-bloomberg-expresses-support-for-nyu-massive-expansion-in-the-village-will-this-help-or-hurt-the-university/ In your April 1 editorial “Let N.Y.U. Expand in Its Backyard,” you claim that New York University “needs to expand” and has “mostly made its case for the extra room.” But surely that is only relevant if the means used to create the “extra room” don’t interfere with the university’s ability to fulfill its educational mission. Bigger is not always better for what a university does. Fearing the effect that the prospect of living 20 years on a construction site is likely to have on its ability to retain and attract top faculty, the university’s politics department, at a March 27 meeting, indicated its opposition to N.Y.U.’s expansion plan by a vote of 27 to 2. Several other departments will be holding similar meetings. When it comes to fulfilling the educational mission of a university, it is not the board of trustees, or the president it appoints, but the faculty who are the best judges of what is needed and what is downright harmful. That makes it doubly unfortunate that most of the media have ignored or trivialized our views. The writer is a professor of politics at New York University. Many, many N.Y.U. faculty members oppose this plan, but not because we’re reactive Nimbys. Instead, we’re worried about the financial and academic health of our university, which we believe will be negatively affected by this oversized plan. We’re worried about the health of the tenants who live in the superblocks and who will endure 20 years of nonstop construction noise, dust and the army of rats expected to be unsettled by the big dig. Finally, we’re worried about the architectural and environmental health of a beloved neighborhood. Ironically, N.Y.U.’s building plan would do devastating harm to the very neighborhood that is part of its sales pitch to prospective students. N.Y.U. is a vital part of Greenwich Village. But it cannot be allowed to tower over it — literally or figuratively. The writer is a professor of performance studies and religious studies at New York University. I was shocked and disappointed to see the position you took in favor of N.Y.U.’s proposed expansion in Greenwich Village. I know of no one living in the community who supports this plan. It would have an absolutely disastrous effect on the immediate neighborhood and indeed on the wider Village community. I lived for 38 years near the two superblocks where N.Y.U. proposes to expand and know how devastating these changes would be. Community Board 1 has invited N.Y.U. to expand in the financial district. This is a perfect solution, building in a neighborhood that could use more activity and more people, and protecting a neighborhood that cannot sustain the kind of onslaught that the expansion would entail. I agree that N.Y.U. has to expand. But so far it has refused to discuss options that would reduce the plan’s overwhelming impact on our neighborhood. I hope that N.Y.U. takes to heart your point that the current design should be a negotiating position. More than 40 businesses have joined together to raise concerns about this proposal because while we see many benefits of a significantly scaled-down expansion, we also recognize that the current Midtown-like plans would overwhelm the community. N.Y.U. should, in good faith, negotiate with our elected officials to find a common-sense solution that significantly reduces the proposed density, expands opportunities for local businesses, creates accessible open space and adds infrastructure improvements.

And while there is no Lorax in Greenwich Village to protect the parks, gardens, and playgrounds from these expansive construction plans, or NYU 2031 as it has come to be known, there is a woman fighting to keep the towering buildings from casting their gloomy shadows over Washington Square Park. She is Deborah Glick. And while she may not speak for the trees, she is doing her darndest to speak for the community. Deborah Glick‘s district includes the Village, and the NYS Assembly Member has a history of being a “champion” for WSP — she was the only government official to speak up in a substantive way against the dramatic redesign of the Park. And, for those (like me) who knew the film “The Lorax” came out recently (you couldn’t really miss it; it was also accused of greenwashing), didn’t see it, and didn’t recall the premise of the original Dr. Seuss story; here’s the overview from Wikipedia: The Lorax is a children’s book written by Dr. Seuss and first published in 1971. It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the greedy Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book. The book is commonly recognized as a fable concerning the danger corporate greed poses to nature, using the literary element of personification to give life to industry as the Once-ler (whose face is never shown in any of the story’s illustrations or in the television special) and the environment as The Lorax. (The trees at WSP could certainly use a Lorax speaking up for them.) https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/ny-observer-washington-square-park-champion-deborah-glick-squares-off-against-nyus-expansion-plans-also-a-look-at-the-lorax/ Former NYC Mayor Ed Koch (and Village resident) writes an Op-Ed in today’s New York Daily News advocating for NYU’s mega-expansion plan “2031” in which he starts off by admitting to being a partner in the law firm retained to push the plan through. What was the Daily News thinking? Perhaps they couldn’t find anyone else. Every time I do that and see NYU students of every imaginable racial and religious group walking and talking together, I say to whomever I’m with, “These students make the Village what it is. They keep us at the center of thought; they keep us young, and keep the Village an interesting place in which to live. They keep New York competitive with the rest of the U.S. — and, indeed, the world.” Really? Students are fabulous but the sheer number of them, as it is, means they’ve overtaken large swaths of the Village – particularly around Washington Square (already the University’s “core”)- and contributed to a more transient quality by their very large numbers. The Village was “interesting” – prior to NYU being such a behemoth. First, you should know that I am a partner in Bryan Cave LLP. We are attorneys for NYU in its efforts to develop land in the Village owned by the university. That plan, called NYU 2031, calls for four buildings to be built just north of Houston St., amid existing residential high-rises. Those buildings, perhaps as high as 25 floors, would house the facilities of a university with global aspirations. More on NYU at this blog. https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/ny-daily-news-publishes-op-ed-by-ed-koch-former-mayors-law-firm-has-been-retained-by-nyu-to-get-plan-2031-pushed-through-in-favor-of-university-expansion/ There is lots of coverage this morning of last night’s Community Board 2 Meeting in which the full board voted “no” to NYU’s 2031 expansion plan around Washington Square. NYU is “perhaps the most egregious example of a real-estate corporation (or a not-for-profit university acting like one) aiming to shoehorn new high-rise buildings—dorms, hotels, faculty offices—on every available piece of land within their realm with utter disregard for any residents that may stand in their way or for the nature of the historic neighborhood.” DNAinfo.com: NYU Expansion Plan Unanimously Rejected by Village Community Board https://washingtonsquarepark.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/cb2-votes-down-nyu-expansion-plan-not-for-profit-operates-like-for-profit-real-estate-behemoth-will-the-university-back-off/","Dear InboundQuotes reader, now is the time to talk about one of children’s book written by Dr. Seuss, The Lorax. The Lorax first published in 1971. It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book. The book is frequently identified as a story concerning the malicious danger corporate greed postures to nature, making use of the literary component of personification to enliven industry as the Once-ler and also the environment as the Lorax. The Lorax was Dr. Seuss’s personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing economic and environmental issues without it being dull. “The Lorax,” he once explained, “came out of me being angry. In The Lorax I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might.” The Lorax was one of Dr. Seuss’s favorite books. He had the ability to create a tale addressing environmental issues without it being dull. The Lorax,” he once clarified, “came out of me being mad. In The Lorax I was out to attack what I think are malicious things and let the chips fall where they might.” You can talk about conversation with your kids and students about nature by discussing “The Lorax”. It will triggered their ecological smarts. Not every adult have the same opinion after reading this gem. The reactions are vary. For those of you in the industry that make money from environment, you might find that the book oversimplifies the big issues and demonizes your job. However, this tale is a fun way for you to discuss about environment stuff with youngster. The Lorax itself is about an environmental disaster. Maybe it’s children’s favorite topic. But even at its ugliest, this story will keep kids awake, alert, and engaged. The Lorax draws kids into its world. The world that similar enough like our own to be relatable, but just different enough to be, well, less boring. There are so many lesson in the books. You read it between the line from the quotes mentioned in the book (and movie) A tree falls the way it leans. be careful which way you lean I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues I see your point. But I wouldn’t know the answer Sir, you’re crazy. You’re crazy with greed. There’s no one on earth who will buy that fool thneed! Yes, I am the Lorax who speaks for the trees, which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please. Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not. Once-ler! You’re making such smogulous smoke – my poor swomee swans, why they can’t sing a note! No one can sing who has smog in his throat. The things that you do are completely un-good.’ Yeah? But if I didn’t do them, then someone else WOULD! That’s a very good point, Mr. Once-ler. Progress is progress, and progress must grow! Cause when a guy does something stupid once, well that’s because he’s a guy. But if he does the same stupid thing twice, that’s usually to impress some girl Look, Lorax, calm down. There’s no cause for alarm. I chopped just one tree, I’m doing no harm. This job was too big for one Once-ler alone! So promptly I built me a radio phone. And I called my brothers and uncles and aunts and said. Listen here! Here’s a wonderful chance for the whole Once-ler family to get mighty rich! Little did you know, the film is the second fully computer-animated Dr. Seuss book adaptation and the fourth that feature in film.

Instead of using stubborn wires and your rusty soldering skills to painstakingly connect components, why not use paint and glue? This tutorial will share various recipes to create your very own conductive paint, tape, glue, and ink. Using a maximum of 3 easy to find ingredients, these simple materials are easy to make. All of the conductive materials explained in this Instructable are based around the conductive paint (step 1). Using increments of different chemicals, the consistency of the paint can be changed from thick to thin (glue to ink). At the end of the Instructable a simple project will be shown using conductive materials (step 5). There is also a step that is dedicated interfacing conductive materials with kits and teaching classes and workshops.      Even though commercially available conductive materials work great, they are a wee pricey and often need to be ordered online. Another disadvantage of commercial products is that they are usually only available in conductive paint form.      To start off, I would like to share some of the science behind the main ingredient used in the conductive materials; graphite. Graphite is a mineral and a form of pure carbon. Graphite is very conductive and is sometimes used in arc-lamp electrodes. Because of its conductivity, graphite is the primary candidate for making conductive materials. Its other bonuses include being easy to obtain, mixing well with paint, and coming in a very fine powdered form.       Here are the supplies needed to make the conductive materials in this Instructable: - powdered graphite lubricant- from from Ace Hardware or other hardware store - black poster paint- from local craft store or from Amazon - paint thinner- from local hardware store or from Amazon - popsicle/mixing sticks- from local craft store or Walmart  - mixing cups- I used styrofoam cups from grocery store - measuring spoon- baking spoons will work       To complete the ink and stamping steps and the project, you will need these additional supplies: - light emitting diode (led) available at local Radioshack - 3-volt coin cell battery- available at grocery store - sponge- some type of sponge, I got mine out of an old printer ink cartridge - airtight vial- any type of airtight container will work - airtight plastic container- possibly tupperware or old food container   - paper      Now that the materials have been gathered, it is time to begin making conductive materials!Warnings: Some of the projects and instructions in this Instructable use paint thinner. This chemical produces nasty fumes that probably aren't very healthy for you. Perform all projects using paint thinner in a well-ventilated room. I am not responsible for any accidents that may occur while using this Instructable. This Instructable is submitted for Powell Cubs for the Instructables Sponsorship Program. The first part of this tutorial features conductive paint. The paint will be the base of all of the other materials that are explained in this Instructable. The paint makes an ideal base because of its consistency. To make glue you add slightly more graphite powder, and to make ink a few drops of paint thinner is added... but onto that in later steps.      Conductive paint sticks well to most materials, especially paper and cardboard. Anything that the poster paint will bond to, the conductive paint will as well. I have found that this mixture of conductive paint flexes well on paper. However, sharp creases and folds will lead to a crack, usually causing a shaky connection. The conductive paint will turn out to have the same flexibility as the paint that is mixed in. As a general rule of thumb, use this paint in low-medium areas of stress to ensure a reliable connection. For higher stress applications resort to one of the conductive inks mentioned later in the Instructable.      The two materials used in conductive paint are powdered graphite and the poster paint. After much experimentation, I found that a mixture of 2 parts powdered graphite to 1 part black paint worked exceptionally well. Instructions: Using the measuring spoon, measure out two spoonfuls of powdered graphite and pour it into a mixing cup. Add 1 spoonful of the poster paint. Mix well, making sure all of the graphite is added. Application: Slather heavily onto the material (i.e- paper, cardboard) in the desired pattern using a paintbrush. Make sure that all lines are coated evenly. Allow a few hours to dry before using. Store remaining paint in an airtight container.      When dry, the conductive paint has a very low amount of resistance. After several tests, I calculated the resistance to be around  115 ohms per centimeter.  If the circuit schematic calls for a small resistor  (<115 ohms), it would be alright to omit it. I found that when you connect a new 9-volt battery to a painted line (of conductive paint) and attach a digital multimeter on the other side, the voltage detected is 9.27-9.28 volts out of 9.29-9.30 volts. In sum, there is a very minimal amount of voltage lost when using conductive paint. Now that the base paint has been concocted, other materials can be made. In this step I will highlight the making of conductive adhesives. Conductive tape and conductive glue will be shown.Conductive Tape: Conductive tape can be used to bind paper and cardboard together, as well as connect components for a quick and easy prototype. I would not suggest using conductive tape for permanent or moving circuits, as it will become loose over time. Instructions: Paint a layer of conductive paint onto thin strips of paper. Wrap around the desired object tightly, ensuring a good connection. To store the tape, place the painted strips side by side in an air tight container or bag. Conductive Glue: Conductive glue can be made by adding more dry materials to the original base.  It could be used to create a binding substance for numerous sheets of paper, cardboard, etc. Glue can also be used to attach electronic components to the painted lines in a schematic. It bonds well to most materials, including the metal leads of components, paper products, and plastics. Since more graphite is added to the original base to make glue, the glue will have even less resistance, depending on the amount of graphite used.Instructions: ​Mix up a batch of the base paint (2 parts graphite, 1 part black paint) in a mixing cup. Keep adding graphite powder, one part at a time, until the glue reaches the desired consistency. I found that 4 parts graphite to 1 part of paint was about the right consistency. Adjust the consistency to your desires.Application: Using a paintbrush, slather the mixture on the component lead or desired surface. For thicker mixtures, use a mixing/popsicle stick to place a dollup of glue on the material. When gluing a component, ensure that the glue is contacting the lead of the component and the line of conductive paint. Allow a few hours for the paint to dry before using the circuit. Store in an airtight container. Conductive ink is another necessity in the field of conductive materials. Ink's thin consistency makes it perfect to apply to paper and cardboard. My initial experiments in the conductive materials field were focused on conductive ink. I tried to mix water and graphite together. However, I soon found out that graphite and other conductive metals/minerals were not water soluble... the graphite would always settle to the bottom of the water, no matter how much mixing was done. Eventually, I gave up on ink and moved onto paints and glues.      After succeeding at these, I came back to ink. My spark came when I was searching through the mess in our basement for more black paint. I saw a jug of paint thinner. Paint thinner is a solvent that is usually used to thin oil-based paints. It can be made of mineral spirits, acetone, naphtha or other nasty chemicals. To reiterate the warning in the intro, always use paint thinner in a well-ventilated area.       Conductive ink is much more flexible then conductive glue, and works better in high-stress applications. Conductive ink can be used in all sorts of applications.      Once again, using the base paint described in step 1, paint thinner is mixed in. As might be expected, the paint thins into a ink-like consistency, depending on the amount of paint thinner used. After being made there are a number of ways that conductive ink can be applied. For a stamp/inkpad method refer to step 4.Instructions: Mix up a batch of the base paint in a mixing cup. Add 1-2 parts of paint thinner to the mixture. Stir well with a popsicle stick. The substance will cling to the sides of the cup in long droplets. Just keep scraping the drops off the cup until well mixed. Add paint thinner until the concoction reaches the desired consistency. Application: Insert a paintbrush and scrape the cup. The ink will be sucked into the paintbrush and off of the cup. Apply the conductive ink to the desired surface or refer to step 4 for a tutorial on a conductive ink pad stamp. Store in an airtight container. You know those cool stamps that you press onto a piece of paper to leave a meticulous ink pattern or lettering? Your teacher might have used one to stamp a ""Good Job"" on your worksheet when you were in school. Soon after creating the conductive ink, I realized that it should be applied in a different way then the paint. Instead of using a paintbrush, it would be fun to stamp circuitry onto a piece of paper. Using a stamp, you can neatly press a ""printed"" circuit board onto a piece of paper.      In this part of the Instructable, I will demonstrate how to acquire your own stamp, and make a proper ink pad loaded with conductive ink.      If you do not want to make your own stamp, you can customize and purchase professionally made rubber stamps from many online sites such as here. Even though these stamps are pricey, if you are going to be making a lot of the same circuit board, these would come in very handy. Another idea for stamping is to use locally available stamps. You could stamp letters and use them as the wiring in your circuit. These stamps are available at your local craft store.Instructions: The stamp: Since stamp-making is beyond this instructable, search the Internet for a tutorial on how to create your own stamp. A great collection of tutorials can be found here. Create your stamp in the pattern of your desired schematic. For places where components connect, make circles for easy interfacing with conductive glue.The ink pad: Insert the sponge in a air tight container with the lid removed. Mix up a batch of conductive ink as described in step 3. Try to make a ink of a very thin consistency, such as a consistency  nearly as thin as water. Mix it well and collect it in a brush. Paint the ink onto the sponge until it is soaking with conductive ink. If the ink is not absorbed, the ink is not thin enough.Application: Press your stamp into the ink pad, ensuring equal coverage of ink. Push the stamp down onto the desired surface and pull up. If the desired area is not coated well, stamp again over the same spot. Repeat until the stamped area is all black and without visible paper.       Stamped circuits may be subject to a slightly higher resistance then normal brushed paint or ink because not as much ink is put down onto the surface. The resistance all depends on how much ink is put down during stamping and how wide the stamped lines are. Now that all the recipes for the conductive materials have been shown, it is time to use these in a circuit. During this step, I will demonstrate how to build a simple circuit using conductive paint, ink, glue, and conductive tape. The circuit consists of  an led and a  3 volt battery. A resistor is not needed in this circuit.  You will also need all of the previously mentioned conductive materials and a piece of paper.Instructions: First, paint or stamp two parallel lines about 1/2 inch apart on a piece of paper. Attach a 1 inch piece of conductive tape to both sides of the 3 volt coin cell battery. Center the battery on its edge and press the tape onto the corresponding lines. Make sure that the tape and paint are making good contact. Next, use conductive glue to attach one of the led's leads to the other end of one of the painted lines, noting proper polarity. Remember that the flattened side of the led is the negative lead.  Bend the opposite lead of the led so that it is not touching the parallel line. Allow the circuit to dry. Finally, to turn on the circuit, press the bent lead down onto the painted line. This will close the circuit, and the led should turn on. During this Instructable you have learned how to make conductive paint, tape, glue, ink, and stamps. You are probably wondering how else you could use your new knowledge. Conductive materials are a great way to make kits. Whether you are teaching a large group about electronics or just a few people, pre-made kits are an essential teaching tool for a hands-on experience. Conductive materials supply many advantages for making kits.       First of all, conductive materials are perfect for kids/adults who are new to electronics. When teaching an electronics class, it would be much easier if the kits did not require soldering and jumbles of confusing wires. Instead of messy and often irreversible solder, conductive glue would solve the problem with a fun and easy way to attach components. Conductive painted wires would provide an easy layout of the circuit. Students could easily be able to see what connected to what.      Another pro of using conductive materials in kits is circuit boards. Instead of spending long hours and tons of money creating traditional circuit boards for the class, paper circuit boards could be mass produced using the stamping method. Identical boards could be created in an efficient manner.       Overall, paper electronics would make the perfect materials for kits. Teaching classes would be made easy, and budding electronic geniuses would have the opportunity to experiment with the cutting edge technology of conductive materials. Here are a few things that could be included with kits: - paper - conductive paint, ink, tape, glue - stamps/ or materials for a diy stamp - paintbrush - electronic components During this Instructable you first learned how to make conductive paint. Then, from there, the tutorial went on to explain the process of making conductive tape, glue and ink/stamps. With these conductive materials you now have the ability to make your circuits cheaper, thinner, easier, and more flexible. Hopefully you will be able to apply these materials to your future projects and experiments. As an ending note, I would like to share some of my ideas for more things that could be done with conductive materials. Since it is a fairly new technology, there are loads of things that could be developed. Here are a few: - a conductive ink printer - colored conductive materials - paper components, electronic components that could be stamped onto paper - interactive paper business cards or newspaper - transparent or translucent conductive materials      Thank you for reading this Instructable. I hope that you have learned a ton about conductive materials and their applications. Thank you -icecats- Thanks for the detailed instructable. I'm trying to make some connections on a piece of fabric that will potentially be subject to a good amount of bending. I tried using a commercial carbon paste, which resulted in very good conductivity, but the lines of paint I drew broke immediately upon flexing. You state that the carbon 'ink' was much more flexible than the paste- do you think a dilution of my carbon paste in paint thinner or acetone will suffice for my purpose? How did you test that the carbon ink was superior for higher-stress applications? Look forward to your response! It would definitely be worth a try. Any type of flexing material will probably be hard on conductive ink/paste. You could try mixing the graphite with some kind of flexible glue. Also, have you considered conductive thread? Okay. I tried a greater dilution today, and the lines didn't crack...but they also didn't really conduct. I'm going to go back and apply some more layers. maybe try widening the line width to decrease resistance (though I don't know how significant that will be). I have also been looking into conductive thread and tape- my partner wants to try the paint, so I'm seeing if I can make it work, but realistically I believe those options will probably work better. Very interesting instructable. It has given me some food for thought. I have an old ffc cable that has a few worn out traces. This cable is specialized and a generic comerecial replacment is not available Maybe a fine piece of sewing string doped with this mixture might work. The traces are thin. Do you think this is a possibility?Thanks for sharing this . Great tutorial. I have some questions below... I am trying to repair a DVD remote keypad that has worn a lot of the conductive material off on the underside of the rubber/silicone pad that makes contact with the PCB and creates a circuit. The cost of commercial conductive epoxy or even the inks make it expensive/uneconomical to repair. If this formula of  yours is conductive enough to work on an infrared LED it sounds like a great solution. If not I will probably look at using a thin copper foil with superglue to put on the underside of the pad. Thanks. The conductive material highlighted above should work with your application. Extended flexing would probably take its toll on the paint though. It would be worth a try (under $5.00). Thanks for the help. Would you suggest the ink or the glue application for the longest durability on a keypad? Probably glue. thank u so much.i tried it but i am getting a very high resistive paint(about 30kohms). I want to make a flexible heater 20W/12V with this paint. Is it possible? Of all the Instructables I have seen, this may be the coolest!! Great job on this!! However, I have had another idea for conductive tape which mimics the conductive tape made by professionals. Maybe you could add some sort of clear (but conductive) adhesive to the back of a strip of aluminum foil, which is already conductive. This way, you can have conductive tape with less resistance! It may not be too strong, but it still may work. Anyways, great job on the Instructable! 1)  It's not even usable for 99% of circuits.  The resistance is too high and the durability very questionable because it's going to heat up with that high a resistance. 2)  You can't just slap this on aluminum foil because aluminum foil immediate forms an aluminum oxide layer on it (even if you polish it away or use lye) that is non-conductive.  There are ways to get it to work but there is no sense in doing any of them when silver or copper would work much better. ... but actually, what works even better when it's possible is to use real wire or a PCB.  There's really no point in trying to avoid learning to solder if learning electronics prototyping.  It's not even a time saver since waiting for glue to dry takes longer than soldering a few joints. Great idea. Thank you. ""When dry, the conductive paint has a very low amount of resistance. After several tests, I calculated the resistance to be around   115 ohms per centimeter. Even though 1 centimeter of standard 22 gauge hookup wire has a resistance of about 2 ohms, the 113 ohms difference will barely make a difference in the circuit. If the circuit schematic calls for a small resistor  (<115 ohms), it would be alright to omit it. I found that when you connect a new 9-volt battery to a painted line (of conductive paint) and attach a digital multimeter on the other side, the voltage detected is 9.27-9.28 volts out of 9.29-9.30 volts. In sum, there is a very minimal amount of voltage lost when using conductive paint."" Thank you 115 ohms /cm is a  HUGE amount of resistance, which is why conductive paint is not normally made in this way but instead with silver particles. 22 gauge hookup wire does not have 2 ohms /cm, that is a measurement error from your multimeter contacts, leads, and the physical touching of the probes or clips to the wire.  Actual resistance of 1 cm, 22 ga. wire is about 0.001 ohms. You cannot measure voltage like that, it has to be voltage powering a load.  115 ohms is completely unacceptable for any circuit except those that just happened to need the particular amount of resistance that causes and ironically enough the only thing I can think of at the moment that would call for that would happen to be powering a ~20mA LED by a 9V battery. #22 wire has a resistance of about .053 ohms per meter.

where is the location of the hanging gardens of babylon,"The Hanging Gardens is the only one of the seven ancient wonders for which the location has not been definitively established. Traditionally they were said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC and quoted later by Josephus, attributed the gardens to Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled between 605 and 562 BC. There are no extant Babylonian texts which mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon.","The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Hanging Gardens' name is derived from the Greek word κρεμαστός (kremastós, lit. 'overhanging'), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word ""hanging"" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.[1][2][3] According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis[4] and they have been called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis as an alternative name.[5] The Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders for which the location has not been definitively established.[6] There are no extant Babylonian texts that mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon.[7][8] Three theories have been suggested to account for this: first, that they were purely mythical, and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings (including those of Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden;[9] second, that they existed in Babylon, but were destroyed sometime around the first century AD;[10][4] and third, that the legend refers to a well-documented garden that the Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, near the modern city of Mosul.[11][1] There are five principal writers whose descriptions of Babylon exist in some form today. These writers concern themselves with the size of the Hanging Gardens, their overall design and means of irrigation, and why they were built. Josephus (c. 37–100 AD) quotes a description of the gardens by Berossus, a Babylonian priest of Marduk,[6] whose writing c. 290 BC is the earliest known mention of the gardens.[5] Berossus described the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II and is the only source to credit that king with the construction of the Hanging Gardens.[12][13] In this palace he erected very high walls, supported by stone pillars; and by planting what was called a pensile paradise, and replenishing it with all sorts of trees, he rendered the prospect an exact resemblance of a mountainous country. This he did to gratify his queen, because she had been brought up in Media, and was fond of a mountainous situation.[14] Diodorus Siculus (active c. 60–30 BC) seems to have consulted the 4th century BC texts of both Cleitarchus (a historian of Alexander the Great) and Ctesias of Cnidus. Diodorus ascribes the construction to a Syrian king. He states that the garden was in the shape of a square, with each side approximately four plethra long. The garden was tiered, with the uppermost gallery being 50 cubits high. The walls, 22 feet thick, were made of brick. The bases of the tiered sections were sufficiently deep to provide root growth for the largest trees, and the gardens were irrigated from the nearby Euphrates.[15] Quintus Curtius Rufus (fl. 1st century AD) probably drew on the same sources as Diodorus.[16] He states that the gardens were located on top of a citadel, which was 20 stadia in circumference. He attributes the building of the gardens to a Syrian king, again for the reason that his queen missed her homeland. The account of Strabo (c. 64 BC – 21 AD) possibly based his description on the lost account of Onesicritus from the 4th century BC.[17] He states that the gardens were watered by means of an Archimedes' screw leading to the gardens from the Euphrates river. The last of the classical sources thought to be independent of the others is A Handbook to the Seven Wonders of the World by the paradoxographer Philo of Byzantium, writing in the 4th to 5th century AD.[18] The method of raising water by screw matches that described by Strabo.[19] Philo praises the engineering and ingenuity of building vast areas of deep soil, which had a tremendous mass, so far above the natural grade of the surrounding land, as well as the irrigation techniques. It is unclear whether the Hanging Gardens were an actual construction or a poetic creation, owing to the lack of documentation in contemporaneous Babylonian sources. There is also no mention of Nebuchadnezzar's wife Amyitis (or any other wives), although a political marriage to a Median or Persian would not have been unusual.[20] Many records exist of Nebuchadnezzar's works, yet his long and complete inscriptions do not mention any garden.[21] However, the gardens were said to still exist at the time that later writers described them, and some of these accounts are regarded as deriving from people who had visited Babylon.[2] Herodotus, who describes Babylon in his Histories, does not mention the Hanging Gardens,[22] although it could be that the gardens were not yet well known to the Greeks at the time of his visit.[2] To date, no archaeological evidence has been found at Babylon for the Hanging Gardens.[6] It is possible that evidence exists beneath the Euphrates, which cannot be excavated safely at present. The river flowed east of its current position during the time of Nebuchadnezzar II, and little is known about the western portion of Babylon.[23] Rollinger has suggested that Berossus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar for political reasons, and that he had adopted the legend from elsewhere.[24] Oxford scholar Stephanie Dalley has proposed that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were actually the well-documented gardens constructed by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (reigned 704 – 681 BC) for his palace at Nineveh; Dalley posits that during the intervening centuries the two sites became confused, and the extensive gardens at Sennacherib's palace were attributed to Nebuchadnezzar II's Babylon.[1] Archaeological excavations have found traces of a vast system of aqueducts attributed to Sennacherib by an inscription on its remains, which Dalley proposes were part of an 80-kilometre (50 mi) series of canals, dams, and aqueducts used to carry water to Nineveh with water-raising screws used to raise it to the upper levels of the gardens.[25] Dalley bases her arguments on recent developments in the analysis of contemporary Akkadian inscriptions. Her main points are:[26] King Sennacherib's garden was well-known not just for its beauty – a year-round oasis of lush green in a dusty summer landscape – but also for the marvelous feats of water engineering that maintained the garden.[36] There was a tradition of Assyrian royal garden building. King Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) had created a canal, which cut through the mountains. Fruit tree orchards were planted. Also mentioned were pines, cypresses and junipers; almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes. A sculptured wall panel of Assurbanipal shows the garden in its maturity. One original panel[37] and the drawing of another[38] are held by the British Museum, although neither is on public display. Several features mentioned by the classical authors are discernible on these contemporary images. Of Sennacherib's palace, he mentions the massive limestone blocks that reinforce the flood defences. Parts of the palace were excavated by Austin Henry Layard in the mid-19th century. His citadel plan shows contours which would be consistent with Sennacherib's garden, but its position has not been confirmed. The area has been used as a military base in recent times, making it difficult to investigate further. The irrigation of such a garden demanded an upgraded water supply to the city of Nineveh. The canals stretched over 50 kilometres (31 mi) into the mountains. Sennacherib was proud of the technologies he had employed and describes them in some detail on his inscriptions. At the headwater of Bavian (Khinnis)[39] his inscription mentions automatic sluice gates. An enormous aqueduct crossing the valley at Jerwan was constructed of over two million dressed stones. It used stone arches and waterproof cement.[40] On it is written: Sennacherib king of the world king of Assyria. Over a great distance I had a watercourse directed to the environs of Nineveh, joining together the waters.... Over steep-sided valleys I spanned an aqueduct of white limestone blocks, I made those waters flow over it. Sennacherib claimed that he had built a ""Wonder for all Peoples"", and said he was the first to deploy a new casting technique in place of the ""lost-wax"" process for his monumental (30 tonne) bronze castings. He was able to bring the water into his garden at a high level because it was sourced from further up in the mountains, and he then raised the water even higher by deploying his new water screws. This meant he could build a garden that towered above the landscape with large trees on the top of the terraces – a stunning artistic effect that surpassed those of his predecessors. The gardens, as depicted in artworks, featured blossoming flowers, ripe fruit, burbling waterfalls and terraces exuberant with rich foliage. Based on Babylonian literature, tradition, and the environmental characteristics of the area, some of the following plants may have been found in the gardens:[41][unreliable source?] Imported plant varieties that may have been present in the gardens include the cedar, cypress, ebony, pomegranate, plum, rosewood, terebinth, juniper, oak, ash tree, fir, myrrh, walnut, and willow.[42] Some of these plants were suspended over the terraces and draped over its walls with arches underneath.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, is the only one whose location has not been definitively established.[1] The Hanging Gardens were a distinctive feature of Chaldean Babylon. They were a great source of pride to the people. Possibly built by Chaldean King Nebuchadnezzar II in 600 BC, the gardens are believed to have been a remarkable feat of engineering: an ascending series of tiered gardens containing all manner of trees, shrubs, and vines. The gardens were said to have looked like a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. Traditionally they were said to have been built in the Chaldean city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah,Babil province, in Mesopotamia Iraq. The Chaldean Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC and quoted later by Josephus, attributed the gardens to the Neo-Babylonian Chaldean King Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled between 605 BC and 562 BC. There are no extant Babylonian texts which mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon of the Chaldeans. According to one legend, Chaldean King Nebuchadnezzar II built the Hanging Gardens for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. He also built a grand palace that came to be known as “The Marvel of  Mankind”.","No one can respectfully or expectingly study End Time without insights from prophets of old. One of these major prophets of old is Daniel. Even more so is his 70-week dream. We have discussed his prophecies in good depth in other ahamoment commentary blogs. To begin this article, we will glance at the first 69 weeks of Daniel’s 70-week dream (his vision) of End Time; the day of the Lord. Later we will concentrate on week 70. This is commonly known as Daniel’s 70 sevens. Glance at this graphic: First, one must understand that Daniel’s 70-weeks does not mean a measure of calendar weeks. It is prophetical weeks. One week of 7 prophetic days means 7 years. For a depth study and deeper knowledge of these weeks control/click here. The timetable of Daniel chapter 9 has all to do with Christ’s first and second advent. Daniel 9:1 through 23 is background by Daniel. Verses 9:24-27 one finds the rest of this amazing prophecy. There is a long hiatus between week 69 and week 70. It is identified as the Church Age or Era of the Gentiles. Since each week represents 7-years, week 70 is also 7 years long. Week 70 is the duration of the Tribulation. End of dream. Why? Christ will then return (2nd Advent) setting up his millennial kingdom…”Thy Kingdom come…” will then be “thy kingdom is come.” It is significant to grasp what is said to Daniel by the angel Gabriel. Daniel may have misunderstood that the 70-year Babylonian captivity somehow represented the 70-week dream or vision. Not so. It is the timetable of King Cyrus’ decree to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem upon his release of those in Babylon up to and into “In That Day” of the Lord [read Daniel 9:20-23]. The angel Gabriel corrects Daniel’s mistaken assumption of trying to connect the 70-year Babylonian captivity to his dream of 70-7’s. Daniel finally distinguishes between the two 70-year prophecies when he reevaluates what Jeremiah said about the Babylonian captivity also being 7-years in length using a regular calendar. Translators of Daniel’s 70-7’s dream may be confused by these very similar terms in the Hebrew. *Shavuot and *shavuim. Shavuot in the Hebrew means “weeks” as a measure of sevens as in days of the week. A very similar Hebrew word, shavuim means 7’s. Hence, we get the 70 weeks of seven or Shavuot Shavuim; 70-7’s, not just Shavout. Shavuim means a period of time multiplied by seven. *NOTE: There are other spellings of the same Hebrew words. “(24) Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. (25) Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. (26) And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.” (Daniel 9:24-26) V24: 70 weeks are determined upon who? It is Daniel’s people, Israel, to “finish their transgression”. Transgression means their offense as a chosen people to God and the purpose God had chosen them to be that light on the hillside. The light they never became. The 70 weeks of years of Babylonian transgressions has to do with not following the law of Shemitah…7 x 70 = 490 years of ignoring this repayment and the resting of farm lands and forgiving the debt of fellow Israelis every 7 years. To make reconciliation. To correct a wrong that seems to have embedded itself in the people God choose to carry his torch. There is a price for choices made. Therefore, Daniel prayed a prayer of confession for his people in Daniel (Daniel 9:1-19)…a critical prayer. “…to seal up the vision and prophecy” This is the End Time consequence of Israel’s betrayal of their appointed responsibilities to God. When it is “sealed up”, the Tribulation of Israel specifically and the world in general will be ended. Seal up does not mean to hide this time but to end it. To anoint the most Holy means Christ will then be the anointed ruler over his reclaimed kingdom on earth…”Thy kingdom come…” Satan will then be unable to influence God’s creation. Any sin from this point on will be the sole responsibility of individuals. JIV: (Daniel 9) Gabriel informs Daniel concerning the seventy weeks that it will be 70 x 7 years to the coming or first advent of Christ. This is not Daniel’s 70-7’s dream. It is the prophecy of Jeremiah being fulfilled (cf. Jer. 25:8–12; 29:10–14); Israel’s skipping 490 years of a thing called Shemitah. This is a study in and of itself, exclusive to Israel, and a command of God but not followed by Israel. It involves more than debt forgiveness amongst their own peoples but also commands Israel to give the land a rest every 7 years…(Leviticus 25:3–6 plus Leviticus 25:21-22). This they had not done. Greed and a lack of following God’s law become their way in life. JIV: Coincidental or not? 490 years is approximately the same time between the death of Joshua and the splitting of Israel into two separate kingdoms. Not exact, but very close. Verse 25 identifies the beginning point of this vision given to Daniel and its ending point. Refer to the earlier graphic in this article. Excluding the 70-year Babylonian captivity prophesied by Jeremiah, the dream interruption of 70-weeks at week 69. Week 69 is the time of the Gentiles. Only God knows when enough is enough to send Christ back to earth, to bind Satan, then begin his Millennial Reign. “threescore and two *weeks [Shavuot] shall Messiah be cut off” is a reference to the 32 years of Jesus’ time on earth. *Again, this term of weeks means years. Several times in scripture such terminology is used. To the studious disciple of scripture, one might wish to reconsider creations “given” God’s TIMETABLE of “in seven contiguous days God created all things.” We teach but you decide. We at ahamoments do not teach others what to think as much as we wish to teach others how to think. We teach but you decide. This series of commentary articles gives focus to number one through five in our introductory paragraph. It does not serve to detour the focus of this narrative commentary of articles. Therefore, we leave this article as is written. Back to our end of time studies. DISCIPLESHIP STUDY NOTE: There are differing uses of 7 and 70 in scripture. Here are two: We can see that there is more than butter on this sandwich of events DURING the 70-week prophecy. This discussion will be simplified later in our End Time series. Rev. Dr. Jstark2022 NOTE: All bible references are from the NKJV unless otherwise stated. NOTE #2: Given the limited amount of information that we know about Nahum, the best we can do is narrow the time frame in which the Book of Nahum was written to between 663 and 612 B.C. Two events are mentioned that help us to determine these dates. First, Nahum mentions Thebes (No Amon) in Egypt falling to the Assyrians (663 B.C.) in the past tense. This means it had already happened. Second, the lion’s share of Nahum’s prophecies came true in 612 B.C. so they were prior to 612 B.C. In a possible scenario, Nahum 1:9 is a reminder of the repentance of Nineveh including the king, back in the Book of Jonah some 80 or 90 years earlier. (v9) What do you conspire against the LORD? He will make an utter end of it. Affliction will not rise up a second time. Assyria’s capital city [Nineveh] is to whom Nahum is addressing. This is the same place Jonah prophesied. There are differences of commentary and Bible scholarly opinions as to what and to whom affliction the second time means in verse 9. Consider that only 80 to 90 years earlier, Jonah brought a strong warning of Nineveh’s pending destruction unless they repent. They did repent to Jonah’s dismay. This warning is not to be Nineveh’s second chance. They had their warning through Jonah. There will not be, according to Nahum, given another warning. Pending is now their utter destruction. This indicates that a warning from God may have a long or short lifetime. However, one must consider God’s warnings have an eternal timeline. We have no way of documenting this thought, but perhaps the reason Nineveh was so open to repentance at the time of Jonah was they had some “affliction” meaning God’s first warning. *The utter end of its place (Nineveh) was also literally fulfilled. “Not only were these people lost from history, even the city was lost until it was discovered by archaeologists, beginning in the 1840’s.” (Boice) JIV NOTE: Some will wish to argue that Ashur was the capital of Assyria. S/he would be right, until the reign of Assyrian king Sennacherib. He transformed Nineveh and moved the political seat in Ashur to what was already their religious center…Nineveh. Nahum 1:10 Verse 9-11 should be read in conjunction. They address Nineveh being destroyed and Judah being delivered. Verse 10a may be a prophecy of the Assyrian leadership near their end. The following explains the *“entanglement as in thorns” mentioned in verse 10. “Many cities have risen and fallen throughout the course of world history, but few have had such a dramatic history as the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh. At its height, Nineveh was arguably the most cultured and sophisticated city in the ancient Near East, but a combination of factors led to its quick demise. *Dynastic quarrels within the Assyrian royal house precipitated the city’s decline, allowing Assyria’s many enemies to ally and eventually siege and sack the once great capital city of Nineveh.” https://dailyhistory.org/How_Did_the_Ancient_City_of_Nineveh_Fall%3F. This tactic was to divide then conquer. Nahum https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nahum+1%3A11&version=NKJV 1:11 may be a prophetic vision of the future antichrist. The NKJV states: From you comes forth one Who plots evil against the LORD, A wicked counselor. This is easily read right over without consideration. Many commentaries do not even address its possible implications. Who is the “ONE?” Who is that “wicked counselor”? This verse is specific. It says, “THE ONE. The wicked counselor” It is in the singular. Who fits this role to the proverbial “T”? It must be one of Satan’s trinity: Satan (the Dragon), antichrist (beast #1), and false prophet (beast #2). This is Satan’s imitation of God’s three-in-one person…Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Nahum 1:12 is another challenging verse to understand. It is assumed to be specific to Nineveh, Assyria. One of the concerns with this is the use of the terms “you, they, his.” Does Nahum switch his prophetic focus back and forth between Israel and Nineveh? If Assyria is considered symbolic of the word at-large during end time or the Millennial, the “you”, “they”, and “his” could reference both or each individually. Nahum 1:11-12 are specific to Israel. For God will afflict them no more and their yoke will be removed. In verse 14 it is Israel’s oppressors who are the focus. To dig their grave [v14] means their end. Nineveh lost their legacy to Babylon shortly after the time of Nahum. JIV NOTE: There is another legacy not mentioned but can be deduced. The legacy of Israel being identified as a target of others in the world. This is easily observed today. When Christ returns no longer will they be the fish in the barrel that others can take potshots at without missing or Israelis (the fish) escaping. Roles will, in a sense, be reversed. Israel will be held in very high esteem. [cf. Micah 4:2] Nahum 1:13 “…For now I will break off his yoke from you, And burst your bonds apart.” For now can be read as “on that day…” The bonds of Israelis will be gone. The bonds of the world and the bonds of God’s judgements on them will be burst. They will be no longer be in bondage to the world around them. God will have made a new covenant with them. [cf. Jeremiah 31:31-34] Nahum 1:14 is a reference to Nineveh and prophetically to the world “in that Day” [end time]. The LORD has given a command concerning you: “Your name shall be perpetuated no longer. Out of the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the molded image. I will dig your grave, For you are vile.” The carved images and molded images represent all that the world has carved out for their lives, livelihood, institutions, and cultures without God. To dig their graves is symbolic of their destined end in eternity, not heaven but hell’s lake of fire. To symbolically be identified as “in one’s grave” means s/he no longer has control over anything. Each will live out his or her eternal consequence. No longer will there be Free Will. All will then be as determined before the world was created [Ephesians 1:4]. JIV NOTE: This does not mean some are predetermined to be chosen and some chosen to be condemned. It means the end time paths of life and eternity are predetermined. Nahum 1:15 A point often overlooked in verse 15 is the use of the name Judah instead of Israel. Note the “church” of believers is also not mentioned. This time and passage is about Israelis. The global church of believers has already been removed; raptured. “…the feet of him [who is standing] on the mountains” fits well with the return of Jesus Christ as Messiah [see closing paragraph]. Nahum is stating that since the Northern Kingdom of Israel was dispersed by the Assyrians in 722 B.C., only Judah then remains. They too have a limited amount of time left before the Babylonians invade, conquer, then take the Judean population into captivity. It will also be the end of an independent people-nation or kingdom. When the few who return to Judah after being released from captivity in Babylon 70-years later, all remained subject to the Persians, never again a self-determined people until April, 1948. “And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, Which faces Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, From east to west, Making a very large valley; Half of the mountain shall move toward the north And half of it toward the south.” [Zechariah 14:4]. Rev. Dr. Jstark2021 Studying Esther without the “how it got there” or what is its influence and application today. Let us take a moment and look at some interesting facts that lead up to and followed the time of Queen Esther. To the right is a look at where Shushan is located. Here it is called SUSA. None-the-less it is just another name for Shushan. It I said that the tomb of Daniel is in this city. Other places claim his tomb but this one is the most likely because scriptures tell us Daniel spent time there as a government official under Darius (appointed ruler over Babylonian territory captured by the Persians and Medes. One may wish to examine the secular history around Daniel and Susa (Shushan). Go to http://www.biblesearchers.com/prophecy/daniel/daniel8-1.shtml for one good website for so doing. Click on either  Shushan, the capital in the Province of Elam and the River U’lai or Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerses are the same King of the Medes and the Persians according to the Seder Olam Rabbah. One may also wish to click on The Palace at Shushan or The Tomb of Daniel. We disagree with some of this website’s conclusions, but it is mind tickling and an educational moment or two to read. It began as the capital of Elam. Elam was in the line of Shem (Noah’s son). Esther is from a line of Benjamites taken captive along with Judah. The time of Esther is about 140 years after Nebuchadnezzar dispersed and took captive the Judeans of Judah. Judah was dominated by many Benjamites and a significant population Judeans [Tribe of Judah] with a smattering of members from the other Tribes of Israel. (Jeremiah 49:34-39) I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who want to kill them; I will bring disaster on them, even my fierce anger,” declares the Lord. “I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them. I will set my throne in Elam and destroy her king and officials,” declares the Lord. Yet I will restore the fortunes of Elam in days to come,” declares the Lord. Remember that one of the capitals of Persia was Susa of Elam. Alexander the Great died in Babylon “city”. The Babylonian Empire had a second capital in Susa/Shushan. This is the setting of the Book of Esther. The Israelis who were originally Babylonian captives from Judah, but did not return to Judah when released, by choice remained in Babylon and later Persia. This was a significant population of mostly Benjamites and Judeans with some Levites. AHA MOMENT: The two main Benjamite characters of the Book of Esther are Esther and Mordecai. Their names are corruptions of the Babylonian gods Isthar and Marduk. Esther’s Hebrew name was Hadassah which interestingly means Myrtle as in the myrtle tree of Zechariah’s vision in his book, chapter 1:1-17. A 2nd Aha: Go back just a few years, maybe 60 years when Cyrus the Great released the Judean captives in his conquered lands, this included multiple tens-of-thousands of dispersed Northern Kingdom Israelites originally exiled by the Assyrians and living within the other conquered lands of Cyrus. Why is history before, during, and after the Book of Esther so significant. Why is it even included in the Old Testament? We borrow from Robert Mock’s MD article The Festival of Purim his insightful questions. “What if Esther did not exist, or she did not respond to the calling of God and be willing to give up her life for her people.  Within eight years, Ahasuerus was assassinated by a courtier, Artabanus.  No doubt, Ezra, the lawyer and scribe, was alive at the time of Esther.  Fifteen years later, under the rule of Artaxerxes I, Ezra leads the second group of Jews back to the Holy Land in 458 BC.  Was Artaxerxes I, the son of Esther and Ahasueras (Xerxes I)?  Without Esther, would Ezra have been killed in the genocide? Without Ezra, would the compilation of the Tanach, the Old Testament, been completed?  Without Esther, would Nehemiah, the governor, have been killed? Would the third migration back to Israel have never occurred?  Maybe there would not have been enough Jews to migrate back to the Land”. Esther and the Book of Esther may be the common denominator for each of the above scenarios offered by Dr. Robert Mock. There were many Persian kings but only a few have any role in God’s expressed interest in Israelites during the time up to and after Esther. It may be little more than a technicality in our review of whose who in this article but read on. This was a combined empire of the Medes and the Persians when it all began. Eventually the Persians conquered the Medes. When one runs across the name of Astyages, son of Cyaxares, he is NOT a king of the Medo-Persian Empire. He is the last king of the independent Medes in the Mede and Persian alliance. He ruled on his half of the empire 100 years after the time of Esther. This would be the far eastern borders of today’s Iran. AHA MOMENT: The brother-in-law of Astyages was none other than Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and Daniel’s time. It was his sister who was the queen for which Nebuchadnezzar built the “Hanging Gardens” of Babylon. Talk about family in-fighting, Astyages was dethroned by Cyrus of Persia, his grandson. He lived out his life in Persia. Another point of aha in the Book of Esther is the villain Haman. He is an Amalekite. He is in the line and Tribe of Amalec the grandson of Esau. A reading of the Book of Esther might leave one thinking that the dispute between Mordecai and Haman was simply personal. If that is so, then why would Haman seek the execution of all “Jews” in Persia even though there is doubt Haman knew Queen Esther was a Jewess? It goes much deeper. It goes all the way back to the feud between Isaac and Esau. They were then and remain today bitter enemies. It was the Amalekites of the Negev north of Egypt that refused Moses and the Israelites from Egyptian captivity of 400+years to pass through their lands in route to the lands of the Canaanites, Israel’s Promised Land. The author of the Book of Esther is not identified. Most knowledgeable history buffs of the Bible conclude it must have been Mordecai who penned this Bible history. It is logical to conclude that one who was an eyewitness might be the author of greatest knowledge. Besides, Mordecai was significant to this book. His part was as important as was Esther if not a bit more so. The events in the pages of Esther began around the 3rd year of Xerxes’ reign putting it around 583 B.C. They continued at least up to and after the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes) most likely up to 573 B.C. Xerxes was assassinated assassination in 465 BC at the hands of Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard. (Hmmm? Some bodyguard). Let us close this part 2 of Esther with a quote from Charles Spurgeon. “Oh! That you studied your Bibles more! Oh! That we all did! How we could plead the promises! How often we should prevail with God when we could hold him to his word, and say, ‘Fulfill this word unto thy servant, whereon thou hast caused me to hope.’ Oh! It is grand praying when our mouth is full of God’s word, for there is no word that can prevail with him like his own.” (Spurgeon) Rev. Dr. Jstark2021 As is my teaching style, it helps when one can put an event or series of events into perspective or within other historical events of secular history. Remember that the bible does not need to prove itself according to history. History needs to be placed against what the bible states. There is no revision of secular versus scriptural history but there are many who wish to revise scripture to make God what s/he wants instead of us as individuals being what God wanted upon our creation. JIV NOTE: This plays significantly into the Babylonian captivity of the southern Kingdom of Judah 120 years later, the 70 year Babylonian captivity, and to connect the dots……the invasion of Babylon by the MEDES and Persians and eventually Queen Esther of the Book of Esther. Daniel and possibly his three compatriot Hebrew buddies were standing in front of the King of Babylon. They are about to interpret the dream the king had that bothered him very much…about the future. 31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. 33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. 34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. 35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Notice that Daniel says WE will tell once again including his three friends. This verse even suggests that they came with Daniel to tell the king of his dream. 37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. 38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. As we mentioned earlier, no subsequent king had the absolute power of Nebuchadnezzar. Other empires may have exceeded Nebuchadnezzar’s in physical size, but not in absolute authority. Nebuchadnezzar’s statue dream is shown pictorially on the following page. The Babylonian Empire is shown to the left and the conquering Persians to the right (below). And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. The detail and accuracy of this prophecy is a thorn in the flesh to critics; for after Babylon (that had much gold), another kingdom did arise, but not with the absolute power of Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar. In 539 B.C. Cyrus of Medo-Persia conquered Babylon (without a battle! – see our coming article on Chapter 5). Cyrus was part Median and part Persian and so united the two factions into the great Medo-Persian Empire. Silver coinage became the currency of the empire. After the Medo-Persian Empire, history confirms that a third kingdom, wielding brass shields and swords, with stunning speed conquered the Persians and went on to take the known world. It is recorded that Alexander at only 30 or so years of age wept because there were no more lands to be conquered. After Alexander’s death around age 32 the Greek Empire was ultimately divided between his four generals, but it never had the same power as it did under Alexander. Eventually the Greek Empire fell to a fourth empire. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. Now we move onto the ‘iron’ nation that breaks into pieces and subdues all things. Even those with a basic grasp of history will be familiar with the empire that succeeded the Greeks; Rome. Whereas the previous empires took the best of the cultures and nations they were conquering, leaving much intact, Rome did not. The Roman Empire seemed to thrive on what it could destroy. It really did break into pieces and subdue all things. NOTE: Tradition/history has it that when the Romans came to town, they crucified the first 5 or 6 people they encountered. This went a long way toward discouraging ANY rebellion, even if none was in the plans of the conquered villages and cities. Crucifixion was common practice with the Romans. I personally cannot but wonder if Proverbs 27:17 may have implications during this iron age and the future yet not played out. Proverbs 27:17 reads… “Iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.” Did this iron period of Rome in fact sharpen the future Holy Roman Empire; the empire of the antichrist? Recall in our previous article that Daniel had just made a plea with his Babylonian trainer Ashpenaz. We learned that “An inscription was found on a monument that is now housed in the Berlin museum” confirming the person of Ashpenaz; the inscription reads: “Ashpenaz, master of the king’s eunuchs” confirming the historical (secular) accuracy of Daniel. Daniel did not wish to violate his Hebrew culture and Judaism. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? Then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. The prince’s fear is certainly justified! As we will see in the following chapters, Ol’ King Neb had a habit of cutting people to pieces and turning their house into a dunghill! This was just too risky an experiment regardless of how much Ashpenaz liked Daniel. We should also note Daniel was with “others” in the same situation. They are not mentioned by name other than Daniel’s three other teenage captives from Judah we know as Shadrach, Meshach and Aben-nego. Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: “Not wanting to take ‘no’ for an answer, Daniel then goes to Melzar, that is, the guard– this is what the Jews call ‘hutspa’. This is a little like “mommy says ‘no’ so let’s ask daddy!” This is the young teenager character of Daniel revealing itself though he is Spirit lead life. The word “Melzar” is not actually a name but a position; a title. King James calls this guard a “steward.” Strong’s interpretation makes it similar to what one would call a “butler”; i.e. melzar 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them [pulse] ten days. The proof of the pudding is in the eating I’m not sure if ‘consented’ means ‘gave in’. The Hebrew word used for consented is shâma‛. It means to be intelligent about it. 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat. 16 Thus Mel[t]zar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. Can anyone imagine how this went down with all the other Hebrew and possibly foreign captives! In all seriousness, this may have been the start of Daniel’s unpopularity with his colleagues that we see fester and grow in our subsequent chapters. He demonstrates that he is already a “take charge” guy and convincing. Again, note this verse states “than all the children” who were subject to this training. We also should note that the others in training did eat of the non-kosher foods. As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. We strive so often to gain knowledge but without much understanding. Awareness – Knowledge – Understanding [Desire then Action]. It is the Lord who increases knowledge and gives understanding. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Proverbs 1:7) Only a short while ago Daniel and his friends were being taken captive and led to a foreign land uncertain of their future. But like Joseph in Egypt they remained true to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and He gave them favor exalting them in due time. “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:6-7) 18 Now at the end of the days [3 years] that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. “For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another” (Ps 75:6-7) Notice that Daniel uses their Hebrew names! “We will not let go of the truth we know.” Perhaps this also suggests that the Israelites were God’s chosen from all mankind thus the use of their Hebrew names, not the gentile ones the Babylonians gave to them. This brings to mind the old hymn “There’s a New Name Written Down in Glory.” Perhaps the composer/lyrics of this song had insight we don’t entertain. Once we are saved we get a new name and IT is written down in heaven (Burl Ives wrote the lyrics to this song) And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.  Ten times better? This can only mean they were standouts. This surely added to the contempt of three years earlier when Daniel convinced the Mel[t]zer for exception to the food they ate. Now it included ALL of the king’s magicians and *astrologers; not just the other captive Hebrews boys held for three years of training. Next article we meet the magicians & astrologers again, but now in chapter 2, so we’ll talk about them there, but regardless Daniel was ten times better. “For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” (2 Chronicles 16:9) *See appendix per astrologers. Here is an ahamoment for some and a reminder to those who have followed the articles in ahabiblemoments.com. Many times we read right through bible verbiage not catching its total context. History is not comprised of the bible as a religion and culture or nations and history. They are one and the same thing. The bible records history just as a study in high school or college would be if the topic was Middle East History. The following comes from the History of the Medes, neighbors of the Babylonians and Persians. The Medes were an people of Indo-Iranian (Aryan) origin who inhabited the western and north-western portion of present-day Iran. [Babylon would be near the eastern portion of present-day Iran (Persia) but in Iraq] By the 6th century BC (prior to the Persian invasion) the Medes were able to establish an empire that stretched from Aran (the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan) to Central Asia and Afghanistan. Today’s population of the western part of the Iranian Plateau (including many Persian-speakers, Kurds and Azeris) consider themselves to be descended from the ancient Medes. Apart from a few personal names, the language of the Medes is almost entirely unknown. It was most likely similar to the Avestan and Scythian languages. [Scyths are descended from dispersed Jews from Judah and the northern kingdom of Israel. Many are those who remained behind after the Judeans were released by King Cyrus of Babylon to return to their homelands. Take note of the six tribes that made up the people of the Medes. Pay particular attention to the sixth tribe listed below. Now think of the birth days of Jesus] Not only has Wikipedia gone sour on Christianity in their online encyclopedia of histories, *Britannica online has now joined them dispersing false or revised historical facts. The unlearned is being greatly deceived today. It appears the “church” is simply sitting back and accepting these false histories to disseminate. Here is another example how the unlearned may not recognize something stated but is fake history. This is what the people in the churches and students in secular colleges accept as fact without even a whimper of challenge. * https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Book-of-Daniel-Old-Testament “The language of the book—part of which is Aramaic (2:4–7:28; [a truth]—probably indicates a date of composition later [a deception/lie] than the Babylonian Exile (6th century BC). Numerous inaccuracies connected with the exilic period (no deportation occurred in 605 BC; Darius was a successor of Cyrus, not a predecessor; etc.) tend to confirm this judgment. Because its religious ideas do not belong to the 6th century BC, numerous scholars date Daniel in the first half of the 2nd century BC and relate the visions to the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164/163 BC).” Let’s look at this above information as copied and pasted from Britannica’s online encyclopedia concerning the Book of Daniel. My goal is not to refute or add actual secular history supporting what the bible states. It is to caution believers in Christ and the bible to the fact we are already in End Times when false doctrines will fill the pages of written news, broadcasts, and deception prevails (Matthew 24:4-5). We must add, how does “The Language of the book – part of which is Aramaic (2:4-7:28)” translates into this “document being written at a later date?” Aramaic was like the English of today; spoken almost universally; a business language common to this world just as Aramaic was common to the then known world of nations. https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-exiles-life-in-babylonia-revealed-1.5367088… A little known collection of more than 100 clay tablets in Cuneiform script, dating back to the Babylon Exile some 2,500 years ago, was unveiled this week [February 2015], allowing a glimpse into the everyday life of one of the most ancient exile communities in the world. 2500 years ago? Do the math. 2019 minus 2500 years puts us back to the Daniel record, not the one recorded as “probable” fact by the encyclopedia Britannica. http://users.adam.com.au/bstett/BBabylonianExile586BCE.html https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-biblical-city-of-libnah-identified-1.5303117 The Book of Daniel reveals God’s sovereign control of history from 605 B.C. to the Second Advent of Christ. This prophetic writing contains hundreds of predictions that revolve around five basic themes. My objective in Decoding Daniel is to show history revealing prophecy and prophecy revealing history. Yahweh is the Lord of time and history. They are one and the same; not one a story and the other facts of history. They are both part of the same historical facts. He is sovereign over the world, though considerable power and freedom of will have been given to human and angelic beings. Because of this freedom, a great conflict within the physical and spiritual realms is revealed in the Book of Daniel as humans, angels, Satan and God strive to control the future. Today they are cloaked in what man calls politics. Do not be swayed, That is a farce of Satan in his attempt to confuse facts. (Recommended reading: Satan’s Confusing Counterfeits by Joe Crews) God elects to relate to humanity in such a way that humans become a factor in His life and He becomes part of our lives. Paul is strong on this point in his Philippians letter. Because of this interaction, prayers, dreams and visions play a significant role in the events of this book (Daniel) as God reveals the rise and fall of future empires and princes. Although biblical history shows that God changes in the way He feels, plans, and acts in response to our response to Him, there are boundaries to His change. The LORD responds to human actions without compromising His revealed, unconditional plans and purposes. In addition, He never violates His legitimacy, righteousness and holiness. The future God has mapped out in the Book of Daniel will occur. His prophecies we find in history textbooks of the secular world proving many of these prophecies have already happened. Interesting side note… The fact that Daniels accuracy is so on-target, secularists and even some religious sophisticates claim the Book of Daniel had to be written after the fact of history itself. In other words, it was and remains too accurate to be true. Hmmmmm? From the beginning, man’s history has been the story of rebellion against God. Instead of developing morally, humanity continues to head down the slippery slope of decadence, declension and destruction. For this reason alone, God is able to foretell the future with absolute accuracy as He overrules evil for His plans and purposes. Although in some of Daniel’s prophecies evil may appear to be victorious, God is working behind the scenes for good [Romans 8:28]. Joseph characterized God’s sovereign rule over evil for good in this same way in Genesis 50:20: “You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.” Prophetically, the Book of Daniel is the key that unlocks eschatology; the study of the last days. It is indispensable for understanding Christ’s predictions and the Book of Revelation. Many of its symbols are employed in diverse ways in the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ. [Recommended web site: http://www.biblestudyhour.net/Apocalypse.html] Below is an extract from its pages. God’s plan for the world is unfolded in amazing detail in Daniel. *Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream of the Great Image, Daniel’s dream and visions of the Four Beasts, and the Ram and Goat, along with Gabriel’s unveiling of the Seventy ‘Sevens’ provide the framework for prophetic history from 605 B.C. to the second coming [Advent] of Christ. Daniel is written in prose and it differs from other prophetic books of the Bible which often have their oracles written in poetry. Consequently, it appears in the Hebrew Scriptures among “the writings” and not “the prophets.” Nevertheless, Daniel cannot be read like a narrative or novel since it contains images and symbols that need to be understood before God’s plan for the future can be understood. One cannot grasp its prophecies without first knowing a great deal about the rest of the Bible and the secular histories in which it is founded. The prophet has deciphered the dreams and visions with the help of the Spirit of God. Herein a significant part of the outline of God’s plan for “the times of the Gentiles” has been decoded by the prophet. However, translating the details of this period is often left to the readers. My hope is to aid in this task by: 1. Connecting the symbolism decoded by Daniel to historical events, people and places. 2. Interpreting and connecting the symbolism that belongs to yet future events, people and places based on other prophecies contained in the Scriptures. 3. Discovering and interpreting the “types” in the narrative sections. 4. Explaining the words that have been closed up and sealed until the time of the end. In no way is it within my knowledge and study to open what has been sealed by God but we can possibly determine WHAT has been sealed. Someday the hidden will be revealed to all creation. Practically, the Book of Daniel abounds with personal applications. Daniel himself models a godly life, blessed by God from teenage years through old age. A question section appears at the end of each chapter and will be discussed in our Bible Study containing a few applications gleaned from Daniel and others mentioned within that chapter. These questions can and will be an active ingredient for gaining knowledge and understanding. What we desire to do with gained understanding is an individual’s call. We will add secular historical evidence supporting Daniel’s incredible incites of wisdom and understanding of the times. Chronological dating of Old Testament events varies slightly among church and secular scholars. Many variations arise from the Biblical writers themselves. Some count the ascension year as the first year of a king’s reign, others do not. Earlier scholars date the fall of Jerusalem in 587 B.C. and Artaxerxes’ decree to rebuild Jerusalem in 445 B.C. I have opted (JIV) to follow the scholars who date these events as 586 B.C. and 444 B.C. Not a biggie considering it is only a give or take of one year. None the less, it is my hopes to self-explain as we progress through this great study and grasp understanding while offering convincing evidence this is the true Word of God and true history all in one. Somewhere during our study will be a chronology of Daniel with supporting facts. We can divide Daniel three ways: 1) Take it as it is presented in most evangelical Bibles; look at it through its chronological order; 2) divide it between the two languages that it is written in: 1-2:4a (Hebrew), 2:4b – 7 (depending on how one looks at tense, voice and whether Daniel is being quoted or is his own quote) is written in Syriac/Aramaic. 3) Chapter 8 – 12 is written in Hebrew. The Book of Daniel has been a battleground of “higher criticism.” For instance, liberals view this book as Pseudepigrapha, written to inspire the hopes of the Jewish victims during the Seleucid persecution of 170-165 B.C. I (JIV) believe it was written by a prophetic Daniel at the time of the 70 years Jewish (not Israeli) Babylonian exile, perhaps into the rule of Cyrus of Persia. One’s beliefs and interpretation of Daniel can be a litmus test of conservative or liberal orthodoxy. The interpretations of Daniel’s prophecies sharply divide pre-millennial views from a-millennial views. The reader should find that the explanation in this commentary is conservative and (JIV) pre-millennial Tribulation. Enough evidence and scripture will be provided to validate this position. My basis is that the covenant made between God (pre-Jesus’s N.T. times) is not yet fulfilled and the covenant with the Church (body of Christ) is under a New covenant… the church. The book of Daniel is one of the best-loved books of the Bible; it gives us the events of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego and the fiery furnace, Daniel in the lion’s den, Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams of a great nation (statue), and is the setting for the Book of Esther – stories that many of us learned and loved at Sunday school. However the years have come and gone and we so often tend to just skip over those quaint little histories without them having any real impact on our lives. I believe that once we have completed a serious chapter by chapter, topic by topic putting all into a historical context and the study of this amazing book, we will never be the same. This book gives us real perspective, it helps us to see things the way that God sees them – the way Daniel saw them AND the way we will see them as we near total social and political correctness per global opinions but all without God. Daniel, whose name means ‘God is my judge’, was just a teenager, perhaps about 14, when the Babylonian army, led by king Nebuchadnezzar, came and took him, his friends and about 10,000 others of the brightest and royalty of Judah away from all they knew. They were carried them away into a distant land to a culture and language they did not know. It’s hard for us to imagine the feelings and emotions of a 14 (or so) year old young teenager being taken from the security of a family, not knowing if he would ever see them again. Although we are told that there was not a righteous man in Jerusalem at that time (Jer 5:1; Jer 8:5-6), (hence the reason for God bringing His judgment), it would seem that there were still some God-fearing mothers, for Daniel and three of his teenage friends were brought up to know and fear God and even their names were a continual reminder of the God of Israel. But would that be enough? After all, how many young people today, after seeing all that Daniel saw, and enduring all he endured, would make a stand for God in the midst of a pagan culture? Do we really fear God and shun evil as did Job? (Job 1:8). Do we run from temptation like Joseph? (Gen 39:12). Do we find ourselves dropping the odd expletive (Col 3:8), telling a ‘funny’ course joke to our colleagues so that we will fit into the crowd (Eph 5:4), maybe telling the occasional little ‘white’ lie (Col 3:9). “Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?” (James 3:10-11). Were you in church praising God this past Sunday then blending right back into the world on Monday? (Romans 12:1) I heard of a man who went up to a Christian once and asked: “You’re a Christian aren’t you?” The Christian replied “What makes you think that” It should be obvious to all around us. Too many Christians act as secret agents, never wanting to blow their cover. Daniel wasn’t in Babylon long before the Babylonians could tell what was the most important thing in his life. It is my earnest prayer and desire that by the time we reach the end of this study, we too can say along with Daniel that we have ‘purposed in our hearts that we will not defile ourselves’ – no matter what the cost. No this is not the Nike-Colin Kaepernick “no matter what the cost” appeal. Their purpose is just another example of a degenerating America and profiteering. What Kaepernick, a multi-million dollar man is protesting is against the very institution that allowed him opportunity to become a wealthy man with the right to protest. Our Christian stance at “no matter the cost” is talking about eternal things, not check book balances, TV spotlight time or fifteen minutes of camera attention. It does suggest that within Mark 8:36…”to gain the whole world but lose one’s soul” there is a deep meaning most today wish to ignore or deny…perhaps never had a clue. Rev. Dr. Jstark Figs are not uncommon in the Middle East particularly in Israel. Just as olives, figs are native to this land. However, not too many people have visions or figs. Jeremiah did in chapter 24. He saw two baskets of figs. One basket was full of good figs, but the second basket of figs was too rotten to eat. God’s message to Jeremiah is another example of the pending doom and gloom for the Kingdom of Judah. We will return to this thought in a paragraph or two. First, Jeremiah 24:1 gives us a specific example of who Nebuchadnezzar desired to first be taken into captivity to Babylon. It reads in the ESV: Nebuchadnezzar knew what he wanted per resources and skilled labor. The empire of Babylon was growing and he needed skilled labor, not just laborers or captive slaves. This included the likes of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (aka: Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego). He took the best of the best. Interesting but not sure of its implication is the fact Jeremiah described the figs were VERY good or VERY bad; not just good or bad. Jeremiah 24:4 states that this is when he gets it; i.e. the message of the Lord came to him. Oddly God tells Jeremiah that the good figs represent the Judeans taken into captivity, not the ones left free to roam in their homeland. Verses 6 and 7 go on to support this by saying: [6] I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not pluck them up. [7] I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD, and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart. If one reads on we discover that very few of these captives returned to their home land. Not so much due to dying there, but by choice NOT to return when release after the 70 years of Babylonian captivity. So, what does God mean in verses 6 & 7 of Jeremiah 24? Let’s begin by looking at the first sentence in verse 6…I will bring them back to this land.” A quick read of this first sentence leaves the assumption this means after the 70 years of captivity. This is not what it actually states. That is a false assumption. God has always promised as in covenanted with the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (aka: Israel) to bring them back to the Promised Land.  This is end time prophecy yet to be fulfilled. The bad figs are those people who will remain as in left behind, in Judah. Jeremiah 24:8 to the end of this chapter paints a very gloom ending for these who are left behind. In a sense, it parallels the people of earth who remain after the Rapture of the church. Few theologians see this in this passage so I will qualify it as a JIV (Jim’s Introspective View). However, in my heart of hearts I see the strong parallel. God says I will punish them with terrible disasters, people will tremble with fear, people will be forced to seek refuge or forced to go to foreign lands, they will be cursed and called names, war and hunger will be rampant, disease and sword will strike them down, they will finally disappear from the land… (this is key to JIV), and the land will be *void of these rotten figs. *This is the New Earth and the New Heaven prophecy, void of those who refused Christ. The rotten (sin) will be gone as Satan is bond then a thousand years later is cast into eternal Lake of fire from which there will be no escape or another chance given to him or others who ultimately reject the Holy Spirit and Christ.

The first such lists occurred in the first and second centuries BC, with many thanks to the 4th century BC conquests by the Greeks. These conquests allowed access to the civilizations of the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians, of which Hellenic tourists frequently mentioned in their own writings, be it poems, or even guidebooks. The current list, however, originated, and finalized, during the Renaissance. Imagine yourself relaxing in a sun-lit garden overlooking vast Italian vineyards as you begin to read the list below: 1. Everyone was Khufu Fighting The first Wonder on this list is also the first created. Archaeologists believe the Great Pyramid to have been completed near 2560 BC, taking ten to twenty years to construct. As the oldest, the Great Pyramid is surprisingly the only one to remain intact. It’s also the oldest, and largest, of the three pyramids near El Giza, Egypt. Archaeologists believe the Pyramid to be a tomb commissioned by the Egyptian Pharaoh, Khufu, thus granting it the alias of Pyramid of Khufu. In its prime, the Great Pyramid of Giza held the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world; the Pyramid retained this title for nearly four-thousand years. 2. Babbling Onwards Detailed as an extraordinary feat of engineering, the gardens were described as a massive green mountain comprised of mud bricks. The Hanging Gardens were a series of tiered gardens rising to the heavens, consisting of a vast variety of trees, shrubs, and vines. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the only Wonder without a definitive location. In 290 BC, a Babylonian priest by the name of Berossus, credited Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II with the creation of the Gardens in between 605 and 562 BC. The priest cited their location in the ancient city of Babylon, within proximity to current-day Hillah, in the Babil province of Iraq. However, there exists no further documentation, or archaeological evidence in Babylon, to suggest the Gardens even existed. Current speculation suggests that the Hanging Gardens were either destroyed after the first century AD, or they were purely mythical, instead symbolizing a fantasized garden. 3. It’s All Greek to Me Once located in Ephesus, near Selçuk in modern-day Turkey, the Temple of Artemis seems to have possessed the resurrective powers of a phoenix. The Temple of Artemis was rebuilt from the ashes on three separate occasions only to be destroyed a fourth, and final time. The initial structure is believed to have been created in the Bronze Age, surprisingly accredited to the Amazons, before being demolished by a flood in the 7th century BC. In 550 BC, the Temple’s ten-year reconstruction was overseen by a Cretan duo: Chersiphron, an architect; and, his son Metagenes. Two centuries later, in 356 BC, an act of arson consumed the rebuilt Temple, burning through the wooden roof-beams. The final construction occurred only thirty years later, in 323 BC, funded entirely by the local Ephesian population. This third structure would become the Wonder we consider it now, surviving for 600 years. Unfortunately, in the year 268 AD, the Temple was destroyed by the Goths. Bonus fact: A few of the Hagia Sophia columns initially belonged to the Temple of Artemis. 4. Thunderous Inspiration Circa 435 BC, the renowned Greek sculptor Phidias erected the Statue of Zeus in the residing Temple of Zeus at Olympia, Greece. Phidias was employed by the Eleans for his construction of the massive Athena Parthenos statue, hoped Phidias’s work would allow them to outdo their Athenian rivals. The Statue of Zeus consisted of ivory plates, and gold panels over a wooden framework, representing the god Zeus resting on a magnificent throne of cedar, and decorated with ebony, ivory, gold, and various precious stones. Unfortunately, the Statue was destroyed during the 5th century AD, with no replicate being discovered. The only remaining details of its form exist within ancient Greek descriptions, and depictions on coins. 5. A Macabre Monument Between 353 and 350 BC, a tomb was built in Halicarnassus (present-day Bodrum, Turkey), dedicated to Mausolus, a satrap (a governor in the Persian Empire); and, Artemisia II of Caria, his sister-wife. In honour of this, the burial site was named the Tomb of Mausolus. However, especially when discussing the Wonders of the Ancient World, the tomb is most commonly referred to as the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The Greek architects, Satyros, and Pythius of Priene, are credited for the Mausoleum’s design, which stood 148 feet (45 metres) in height, and consisted of four sides. Each side was decorated with an individually-sculpted relief attributed to these four Greek sculptors: Bryaxis, Leochares, Timotheus, and Scopas of Paros. Sadly, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was reduced to ruins by multiple earthquakes occurring between the 12th and 15th centuries. Bonus fact: Due to this Wonder’s fame, the word ‘mausoleum’ is now commonly used to described an above-ground tomb. 6. This Colossus Could Use a Colosseum Following a trend, the sixth Wonder is none other than the Colossus of Rhodes, and located in – you guessed it – Rhodes, Greece. Standing, quite literally, at the height of 108 feet (33 metres), or approximately the same height as the Statue of Liberty, the Colossus was erected in 280 BC by Chares of Lindos to celebrate Rhodes’ victory over Cyprus ruler, Antigonus I Monophthalmus. Monophthalmus’ son attempted to invade Rhodes in 305 BC but was ultimately failed. As with the Mausoleum, this Wonder crumbled during an earthquake in 226 BC and was never rebuilt. However, as of 2015, tentative plans exist to build a new Colossus at Rhodes Harbour. 7. Pharos, Not Pharoahs The final Wonder on this list is the Lighthouse of Alexandria, or Pharos of Alexandria, whose creation is attributed to the Ptolemaic Kingdom; specifically under the reign of Ptolemy I Soter. Soter ordered the construction in approximately 305 BC and was completed during the reign of his son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, between 280 and 247 BC. The Lighthouse achieved an astounding height between 394 and 449 feet (120 and 137 metres), labeling it the tallest man-made structure in the world for many centuries. Sharing with the two prior Wonders, the Lighthouse suffered from three earthquakes occurring between 956 and 1323 AD. It remained an abandoned ruin until 1480 AD when the remaining stones became the foundation of the Citadel of Qaitbay. Remnants of the Lighthouse were found on the floor of Alexandria’s Eastern Harbour by French archaeologists in 1994, and the Egyptian Ministry of State of Antiquities has discussed plans to turn the submerged ruins into an underwater museum.

how many enclaves are in the border region between india and bangladesh,"The India -- Bangladesh enclaves, also known as the chitmahals (Bengali: ছিটমহল chitmôhol) and sometimes called pasha enclaves, were the enclaves along the Bangladesh -- India border, in Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya. Within the main body of Bangladesh were 102 enclaves of Indian territory, which in turn contained 21 Bangladeshi counter-enclaves, one of which contained an Indian counter-counter-enclave -- the world's only third-order enclave. Within the Indian mainland were 71 Bangladeshi enclaves, containing 3 Indian counter-enclaves. A joint census in 2010 found 51,549 people residing in these enclaves: 37,334 in Indian enclaves within Bangladesh and 14,215 in Bangladeshi enclaves within India.","One of the untold stories of Partition is the Partition referendum in Sylhet. Very unusually for partition along the borders of the proposed two-states of India and Pakistan, the Sylhet region (within Assam) at the time had a public poll to decide whether the district would fall into either India or Pakistan. And while it was hotly contested it did mean it had a mandate and as a result a major explanation of why we had a lot less communal violence in Assam than in Punjab and Bengal. On the 6th and 7th of July 1947 the Sylhet Division of Assam under the British Raj held the most momentous poll for the future of the district and its inhabitants – whether it wanted to be in the future state of Pakistan. The referendum simply asked “Should Sylhet join East Bengal?” and for many this would be the first time they voted. So in many ways it was a more important referendum than the BREXIT one held in June 2016 in the UK to leave the EU, as it involved potential joining a new state altogether. Interestingly the Government of British Raj only declared on the 3rd of July 1947 that a referendum would be held to decide the future of Sylhet and H.C Stock was appointed the commissioner of the referendum. That is only a few days before the poll itself! It was clear Assamese wanted to hand back Sylhet anyway as it once belonged to the Bengal province. Essentially as Sylhet was seen as a Muslim majority division within a Hindu majority province like Assam and its people did not speak Assamese but Sylheti and Bengali. The government of Assam believed removing Sylhet would make it more homogeneous and stronger as a result.  This was encapsulated well when the Assam’s Prime Minister Gopinath Bordoloi said in 1946 that his wish was to “hand over Sylhet to East Bengal” Furthermore, Sylhet as a colonial province of Assam was little known other than for tea production and a religious centre but was eventually included into Jinnah’s demand for six province Pakistan – Jinnah was clearly lobbied by Bengali Muslims and indeed made a visit to Sylhet in March of 1946 for its inclusion within Pakistan, as Muslim League leaders entertaining him in their tea plantations, in the photo above. My late father Mushtaq Qureshi wrote quite extensively about the poll just before partition in his autobiography (in Bengali) and it is  a useful example of the verbal history his generation of Bangladeshi’s have of the partition and the poll itself.  Many of his contemporaries are still alive in the UK and Bangladesh and could give verbal histories of those events in Sylhet during their childhood.  I quote extensively from his book, to illustrate the insight you can get from this verbal history amongst the remaining members of his generation who were witness to the events around the poll at Partition. There was a lot happening in Sylhet in the years before the Poll was declared –  the famine in 1943, the ending of the second world war and of course the campaign for the British to quit India. These were just the things my father’s generation of school children in Sylhet Town were observing, for example he states; “When I was a primary school student, the Non-Cooperation Movement was going on. Almost every day there would be a demonstration of students in front of the DC’s office. The Congress activists would have meetings and processions. The police would beat them black and blue; we used to observe silently as some town dwellers would assist the police in beating up Congress Activists, some of whom were Hindus. Later, I realised that it had been a mistake to take every Congressman for a Hindu.” “ There were all sorts of rumours in the air: India and Pakistan would definitely be separated; there would be a united Bengal; Punjab would become a separate country.Amidst all this, the question that was troubling the people of Sylhet was, ‘What will happen to Sylhet?’ ‘Would it be a part of India along with Assam, or would it be a part of Pakistan?’ We learnt that this would be decided through a public poll. Although Sylhet was a stronghold of Congress and Hindus, the Muslim League built a powerful team which started a rigorous campaign for union with Pakistan. We later learnt that they were funded by the central branch of the Muslim League. We also learnt that Hossain Shohid Sarwardi was most enthusiastic about including Sylhet in Pakistan and played the most active role in this respect. He sent a team of around forty students to Sylhet to campaign for Pakistan. Arrangements were made for this team to stay at Bakhtiar Bibi School in the Rainagar area of Sylhet where we went in groups to meet them. We were hardly thirteen or fourteen years old then. “ “ On one particular day, the students of our school pulled down the Union Jack Flag from the court building and hoisted the flag of the Muslim League in its place. They brought the Union Jack Flag to Govinda Park following a scuffle with the Assam Rifles Jawans. When the District Commissioner of Sylhet arrived at Govinda Park, demanding that the flag be handed over, Bari Bhai (Dhola or ‘White’ Bari) thrust his thumb into the D.C’s mouth. To this day, his bravery in performing such an action amazes me. Compared to the brutality with which the Bangladesh police treat politicians nowadays, especially the women activists, the police force of the British Government and the members of the Assam Rifles appear to have been much better. However, one day there was a clash between the police and the students, as an attempt was made to retrieve the Union Jack from Sylhet Kotoali Thana. A student called Alkas died and others were injured when the Assam Rifles fired at them. Having witnessed all of this with my bare eyes, I can claim to be an eye-witness of the anti-British movements.” “ Around this time, most probably on 3 March 1946, Jinnah came to Sylhet and spoke to a large audience in Eidgah Maidan. Then he attended a students’ meeting in which I was also present. I still remember what he said: ‘Today is the third day of March. Students, you march forward.’ Around this time, perhaps before or after Jinnah’s visit, Liakat Ali Khan also visited Sylhet a couple of times. Many of the All-India leaders also visited Sylhet at that time.” “ Finally, the day of the public poll came. On the first day of the two day long poll, Muslim women were prevented from voting by the female activists of Congress. The next day, however, Muslim leaders fetched the female voters from their homes and arranged for them to vote. While it drizzled throughout the day, people waited anxiously for the results. As far as I can remember, 51% of the votes were in favour of Pakistan. Congress’ election symbol was ‘house’ and the Muslim League’s, that is Pakistan’s  was the ‘axe’. We used to chant slogans like ‘Strike the box of the house with the axe” “ All the members of our family, even the women and children, worked hard to persuade people to vote in favour of Pakistan in this public poll. Our mothers, aunts and grandmothers worked especially hard in teaching people how to cast their votes. Jobeda Khatun was the most prominent of the women leaders. Sherajunnesa and Hajera Mahumud also played important roles. Jobeda Khatun was the Begum Rokyea of Sylhet in the field of women’s development. Despite being the daughter of a high-ranking government officer and the wife of a public prosecutor, she worked as one of the leaders of Congress without any hesitation. The women of Sylhet worked for the Pakistan movement under her leadership.” Begum Rokyea of Sylhet was also to play a critical role in the 1970 General Election in Pakistan in the lead up to the liberation of Bangladesh, something l saw for myself. Over half millions people voted in the referendum of which 57 per cent voted in favour of Sylhet joining East Bengal and 43 per cent against. The majority of the population had voted in favour of joining Pakistan. The first instance of electoral irredentism, at least in the Indian sub-continent. Interestingly there was just over 22 per cent of votes were invalid or left blank on their ballot.. Not surprising as for many it would have been their first time of voting. The result was then implemented in the Article 3 of the Indian Independence  Act of 18 July 1947. Karimganj ( blue area outside red boundaries along Assam border in the map above ) was left out of the transfer of land to Pakistan. Even though there was a majority vote across Sylhet to join East Bengal, the published Radcliffe line gave some areas of Sylhet to India like Karimganj, while the rest of Sylhet joined East Pakistan. It had a majority Bengali Muslim population which had opted for Pakistan ( East Bengal ) unlikely some other areas in Sylhet like Moulvibazar which had not. There has never been an adequate explanation for this from the government of the British Raj and would later have an important bearing on the inhabitants of Karimganj and their ability to migrant to the UK. This botched handover was also highlighted by the number of enclaves we had both within India and East Bengal of Pakistan which has only recently been sorted out by the Bangladesh and Indian respective governments in 2015 and has referred to as the the world’s craziest border. Quite honestly it is a bit like the solicitor of the purchase of your home getting their conveyancing wrong for you and it not being appreciated till well after you had moved into the property but involving tens of thousands of life’s. As within the main body of Bangladesh there were 102 enclaves of Indian territory, which in turn contained 21 Bangladesh counter-enclaves, on of which contained an Indian counter-counter-enclave – the world’s only third-order enclave. Within the Indian mainland were 71 Bangladesh enclaves, containing 3 Indian counter enclaves. A joint census in 2010 found 51,549 people residing in these enclaves, of which 37,334 were in Indian enclaves with Bangladesh and 14,215 in Bangladeshi enclaves within India. ‘ On 14 August 1947, the District Commissioner of Sylhet, Mr Khurshed, formally raised the flag of Pakistan in front of his office. Although we were still very apprehensive and unsure as to whether the mighty British really had left India and whether we were really free, our happiness knew no bounds. Little did we know that we were being freed from one master only to be ruled by another. Soon, we came to realise that we had fallen out of the British pan into the Pakistani stove.’ Incredibly the precise borders of the partition of Bengal & Assam were only revealed two days after partition as in the rest of country which added to apprehension of whether the British had left or not.  It would also have added hugely to the tension of the migration between the two states as no one really knew precisely which side of the border there were on. It strikes me as criminally negligent on the part of the authorities not to have at least announced the borders before partition itself. Though the poll was rushed and the implications of the poll result were only made apparent after independence, having the poll at least legitimized the move of Sylhet division into East Bengal, Pakistan. Given that it was done under the Indian Independence Act of 1947, why were not similar polls undertaken in provinces like Kashmir? While Kashmir had another dimension – Princely head of states had the option of either being in India or Pakistan – a poll of local views then would have been a much better means of dividing up Kashmir with possible transfer to the present day unsolvable mess. Finally these and many other instances of maladministration during partition like the creation of enclaves creating problems along the India & Bangladesh border; giving the princely states the option to opt in or out of joining India & Pakistan; declaring borders of the two nations two days after independence makes my case for criminal negligence by the last government of the British Raj as partition displaced up to 15 million people and caused the killing of over one million. Do you have the names of the Sylheti people in the photo with Jinnah. More when we meet. Toshuduk Ahmed; Shawkaut Choudury; Abdul Karhar Choudury; Mohiun Ahmed Uddin Choudury; Abdul Malik Choudury; Abdul Motin Choudury; Abdul Mukit Choudury. M.M Isbhani; Mohammed Ali Jinnah; Mrs Abdul Motin Choudury. Juned Ahmed Choudury; Pia Choudury; Junnun Choudury. That’s a great event in our history. Salute to the campaigners of the referendum like your father. Or else we would have lost Muslim majority Sylhet like Murshidabad, Maldah or Goalpara. The Sylhet referendum was controversial, colluded and orchestrated by Bordoloi Assam, Radcliffe, and the Muslim league.  Sylhet was a district in Assam, the partion of India was based on majotarian states for religious boundary, within that permit Sylhets referendum does not come into it.  Furthermore, the Hindu tea estate Bihari labourers were not alliwed to vote.  57/43% figure would have been a very different story.  My family lost almost 2lacs in monetary value as just after the referendum the banks funds were all transfered to Guwhati, let aline properties.  There is always another side to every story and history is not always a reliable source of knowledge as it depends on the author’s interpretations of events and empirical evidence. Thank you for your interpretation of the history of Sylhet. Sylhet Referendum 1947 & Brexit are not the same thing. We were getting rid of the Occupire/the Master. Brexit is a divorce issue only. I think whole of Bengal and Assam could have been a separate state. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",El pase de diapositivas requiere JavaScript.,,,,,,,,
the most common protocol for website encryption is https (hypertext transfer protocol secure),"As of November 2017, 27.7% of Alexa top 1,000,000 websites use HTTPS as default, 43.1% of the Internet's 141,387 most popular websites have a secure implementation of HTTPS, and 45% of page loads (measured by Firefox Telemetry) use HTTPS.",We use cookies to improve your experience on our site and to show you personalised advertising. Please read our cookie policy and privacy policy.,"Website security is an increasingly important issue in today’s interconnected world. As ways to phish, sniff and breach security become more sophisticated, Google and web masters alike are taking more stringent measures to keep users’ information and web content safe. Enter HTTPS. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version of HTTP. It’s the protocol over which data is sent between a browser and the website to which one is connected. It means all communications between a browser and the website are encrypted by way of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or, its more evolved form, Transport Layer Security (TLS). The purpose of HTTPS first came about to help prevent “man in the middle” attacks, and to prohibit eavesdropping and tampering with or forging the contents of online communication. HTTPS websites give a reasonable certainty that the intended website is not an imposter, and that the content is securely transmitted. In order to protect user data and website integrity, HTTPS is becoming increasingly widespread. At the dawn of the century, HTTPS sites were mostly limited to those that dealt with payment transactions and the transmission of other sensitive information. But in 2014, Google announced its HTTPS Everywhere initiative. The goal was to stimulate a wider adoption of HTTPS to authenticate a wider range of websites, while simultaneously highlighting the significance of website security. According to Google, there are three main reasons why you should always protect your sites with HTTPS. With increasing demand for keeping user communications, identity and web browsing private, HTTPS is on the brink of becoming the standardized default. As of June 2016, 10.2% of Alexa top 1,000,000 websites use HTTPS as default, 43.1% of the Internet’s 141,387 most popular websites have a secure implementation of HTTPS, and 45% of page loads (measured by Firefox Telemetry) use HTTPS. There has been some resistance to HTTPS and it mostly had to do with the myth that HTTPS websites are slower than regular HTTP sites. But thanks to websites like HTTPvsHTTPS.com, you can test the load times and see that the secured counterpart generally operates at a faster speed. In fact, the benefits to HTTPS go beyond user safety and security, and beyond keeping your site safe from attacks (although those are stand alone excellent reasons). To show its commitment to the evolution of online safety, Google has incentivized HTTPS by giving a rankings boost to HTTPS websites. Of course you still need to have a dynamic site with quality content, but this nod to secure sites from Google is a big sign that the shift toward security is picking up the pace. For web builders, securing websites means purchasing an SSL/TLS certificate. Then it’s simply a matter of installing the certificate properly and configuring your server to enable it. However, you do need to configure your server so that every single page of your entire website is served on HTTPS. This is key as it’s the only way entirely benefit from SSL/TLS, and the only way to get an SEO boost from it. HTTPS websites protect mobile traffic as well and the trend toward mobile browsing is only set to increase. Further, both Apple and Google are pushing mobile apps towards encryption by default. While it’s an extra charge and means a few extra steps, there’s no sense in rallying against the tidal wave. HTTPS and secure sites are soon to be the default and the norm so best to dive in now.

It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.[1] [2] In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[3] or HTTP over SSL. The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering.[4] [5] The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates. This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the support of web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent.[6] HTTPS is now used more often by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private. The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme HTTPS has identical usage syntax to the HTTP scheme. However, HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL/TLS is especially suited for HTTP, since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is authenticated. This is the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the server is authenticated (by the client examining the server's certificate). HTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle attacks, provided that adequate cipher suites are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted. Because HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request's URL, query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identifying information about the user). However, because website addresses and port numbers are necessarily part of the underlying TCP/IP protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server, and sometimes even the domain name (e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that a user is communicating with, along with the amount of data transferred and the duration of the communication, though not the content of the communication.[4] Web browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on certificate authorities that come pre-installed in their software. Certificate authorities are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide valid certificates. Therefore, a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website if and only if all of the following are true: HTTPS is especially important over insecure networks and networks that may be subject to tampering. Insecure networks, such as public Wi-Fi access points, allow anyone on the same local network to packet-sniff and discover sensitive information not protected by HTTPS. Additionally, some free-to-use and paid WLAN networks have been observed tampering with webpages by engaging in packet injection in order to serve their own ads on other websites. This practice can be exploited maliciously in many ways, such as by injecting malware onto webpages and stealing users' private information.[7] HTTPS is also important for connections over the Tor network, as malicious Tor nodes could otherwise damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is one reason why the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Tor Project started the development of HTTPS Everywhere,[4] which is included in Tor Browser.[8] As more information is revealed about global mass surveillance and criminals stealing personal information, the use of HTTPS security on all websites is becoming increasingly important regardless of the type of Internet connection being used.[9] [10] Even though metadata about individual pages that a user visits might not be considered sensitive, when aggregated it can reveal a lot about the user and compromise the user's privacy.[11] [12] Deploying HTTPS also allows the use of HTTP/2 (or its predecessor, the now-deprecated protocol SPDY), which is a new generation of HTTP designed to reduce page load times, size, and latency. It is recommended to use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with HTTPS to protect users from man-in-the-middle attacks, especially SSL stripping.[13] [14] HTTPS should not be confused with the seldom-used Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) specified in RFC 2660. , 33.2% of Alexa top 1,000,000 websites use HTTPS as default,[15] 57.1% of the Internet's 137,971 most popular websites have a secure implementation of HTTPS,[16] and 70% of page loads (measured by Firefox Telemetry) use HTTPS.[17] However despite TLS 1.3’s release in 2018, adoption has been slow, with many still remain on the older TLS 1.2 protocol.[18] Most browsers display a warning if they receive an invalid certificate. Older browsers, when connecting to a site with an invalid certificate, would present the user with a dialog box asking whether they wanted to continue. Newer browsers display a warning across the entire window. Newer browsers also prominently display the site's security information in the address bar. Extended validation certificates show the legal entity on the certificate information. Most browsers also display a warning to the user when visiting a site that contains a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted content. Additionally, many web filters return a security warning when visiting prohibited websites. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, opining that ""In an ideal world, every web request could be defaulted to HTTPS"", has provided an add-on called HTTPS Everywhere for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium, and Android, which enables HTTPS by default for hundreds of frequently used websites.[19] [20] Forcing a web browser to load only HTTPS content has been supported in Firefox starting in version 83.[21] Starting in version 94, Google Chrome is able to ""always use secure connections"" if toggled in the browser's settings.[22] [23] The security of HTTPS is that of the underlying TLS, which typically uses long-term public and private keys to generate a short-term session key, which is then used to encrypt the data flow between the client and the server. X.509 certificates are used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client as well). As a consequence, certificate authorities and public key certificates are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more beneficial than verifying the identities via a web of trust, the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures drew attention to certificate authorities as a potential weak point allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.[24] [25] An important property in this context is forward secrecy, which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future. Not all web servers provide forward secrecy.[26] For HTTPS to be effective, a site must be completely hosted over HTTPS. If some of the site's contents are loaded over HTTP (scripts or images, for example), or if only a certain page that contains sensitive information, such as a log-in page, is loaded over HTTPS while the rest of the site is loaded over plain HTTP, the user will be vulnerable to attacks and surveillance. Additionally, cookies on a site served through HTTPS must have the secure attribute enabled. On a site that has sensitive information on it, the user and the session will get exposed every time that site is accessed with HTTP instead of HTTPS.[13] HTTPS URLs begin with ""https://"" and use port 443 by default, whereas, HTTP URLs begin with ""http://"" and use port 80 by default. HTTP is not encrypted and thus is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks, which can let attackers gain access to website accounts and sensitive information, and modify webpages to inject malware or advertisements. HTTPS is designed to withstand such attacks and is considered secure against them (with the exception of HTTPS implementations that use deprecated versions of SSL). HTTP operates at the highest layer of the TCP/IP model—the application layer; as does the TLS security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to the use of ordinary HTTP over an encrypted SSL/TLS connection. HTTPS encrypts all message contents, including the HTTP headers and the request/response data. With the exception of the possible CCA cryptographic attack described in the limitations section below, an attacker should at most be able to discover that a connection is taking place between two parties, along with their domain names and IP addresses. To prepare a web server to accept HTTPS connections, the administrator must create a public key certificate for the web server. This certificate must be signed by a trusted certificate authority for the web browser to accept it without warning. The authority certifies that the certificate holder is the operator of the web server that presents it. Web browsers are generally distributed with a list of signing certificates of major certificate authorities so that they can verify certificates signed by them. A number of commercial certificate authorities exist, offering paid-for SSL/TLS certificates of a number of types, including Extended Validation Certificates. Let's Encrypt, launched in April 2016,[27] provides free and automated service that delivers basic SSL/TLS certificates to websites.[28] According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Let's Encrypt will make switching from HTTP to HTTPS ""as easy as issuing one command, or clicking one button.""[29] The majority of web hosts and cloud providers now leverage Let's Encrypt, providing free certificates to their customers. The system can also be used for client authentication in order to limit access to a web server to authorized users. To do this, the site administrator typically creates a certificate for each user, which the user loads into their browser. Normally, the certificate contains the name and e-mail address of the authorized user and is automatically checked by the server on each connection to verify the user's identity, potentially without even requiring a password. An important property in this context is perfect forward secrecy (PFS). Possessing one of the long-term asymmetric secret keys used to establish an HTTPS session should not make it easier to derive the short-term session key to then decrypt the conversation, even at a later time. Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DHE) and Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman key exchange (ECDHE) are in 2013 the only schemes known to have that property. In 2013, only 30% of Firefox, Opera, and Chromium Browser sessions used it, and nearly 0% of Apple's Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer sessions.[26] TLS 1.3, published in August 2018, dropped support for ciphers without forward secrecy., 96.6% of web servers surveyed support some form of forward secrecy, and 52.1% will use forward secrecy with most browsers.[30] A certificate may be revoked before it expires, for example because the secrecy of the private key has been compromised. Newer versions of popular browsers such as Firefox,[31] Opera,[32] and Internet Explorer on Windows Vista[33] implement the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to verify that this is not the case. The browser sends the certificate's serial number to the certificate authority or its delegate via OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) and the authority responds, telling the browser whether the certificate is still valid or not.[34] The CA may also issue a CRL to tell people that these certificates are revoked. CRLs are no longer required by the CA/Browser forum,[35] nevertheless, they are still widely used by the CAs. Most revocation statuses on the Internet disappear soon after the expiration of the certificates.[36] SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption can be configured in two modes: simple and mutual. In simple mode, authentication is only performed by the server. The mutual version requires the user to install a personal client certificate in the web browser for user authentication.[37] In either case, the level of protection depends on the correctness of the implementation of the software and the cryptographic algorithms in use. SSL/TLS does not prevent the indexing of the site by a web crawler, and in some cases the URI of the encrypted resource can be inferred by knowing only the intercepted request/response size.[38] This allows an attacker to have access to the plaintext (the publicly available static content), and the encrypted text (the encrypted version of the static content), permitting a cryptographic attack. Because TLS operates at a protocol level below that of HTTP and has no knowledge of the higher-level protocols, TLS servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular address and port combination.[39] In the past, this meant that it was not feasible to use name-based virtual hosting with HTTPS. A solution called Server Name Indication (SNI) exists, which sends the hostname to the server before encrypting the connection, although many old browsers do not support this extension. Support for SNI is available since Firefox 2, Opera 8, Apple Safari 2.1, Google Chrome 6, and Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista.[40] [41] [42] A sophisticated type of man-in-the-middle attack called SSL stripping was presented at the 2009 Blackhat Conference. This type of attack defeats the security provided by HTTPS by changing the link into an link, taking advantage of the fact that few Internet users actually type ""https"" into their browser interface: they get to a secure site by clicking on a link, and thus are fooled into thinking that they are using HTTPS when in fact they are using HTTP. The attacker then communicates in clear with the client.[43] This prompted the development of a countermeasure in HTTP called HTTP Strict Transport Security. HTTPS has been shown to be vulnerable to a range of traffic analysis attacks. Traffic analysis attacks are a type of side-channel attack that relies on variations in the timing and size of traffic in order to infer properties about the encrypted traffic itself. Traffic analysis is possible because SSL/TLS encryption changes the contents of traffic, but has minimal impact on the size and timing of traffic. In May 2010, a research paper by researchers from Microsoft Research and Indiana University discovered that detailed sensitive user data can be inferred from side channels such as packet sizes. The researchers found that, despite HTTPS protection in several high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment, and web search, an eavesdropper could infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, his/her family income, and investment secrets.[44] Although this work demonstrated the vulnerability of HTTPS to traffic analysis, the approach presented by the authors required manual analysis and focused specifically on web applications protected by HTTPS. The fact that most modern websites, including Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, use HTTPS causes problems for many users trying to access public Wi-Fi hot spots, because a Wi-Fi hot spot login page fails to load if the user tries to open an HTTPS resource.[45] Several websites, such as neverssl.com, guarantee that they will always remain accessible by HTTP.[46] Netscape Communications created HTTPS in 1994 for its Netscape Navigator web browser.[47] Originally, HTTPS was used with the SSL protocol. As SSL evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS), HTTPS was formally specified by RFC 2818 in May 2000. Google announced in February 2018 that its Chrome browser would mark HTTP sites as ""Not Secure"" after July 2018.[48] This move was to encourage website owners to implement HTTPS, as an effort to make the World Wide Web more secure.

Which means any site or blog which has shifted all its content from an insecure HTTP  connection to a secure HTTPS connection will get a slight boost in their search ranking. But wait! that is not the end of the story. Making this shifting is the most complex shift ever for webmasters because it involves both risks, complexity and a lot of extra cost on your annual webhosting charges thanks to the fairly expensive SSL certificates. BlogSpot users however have the cost advantage here because Google has announced assigning free HTTPS on blogs hosted with the free '.blogspot.com' extension. No announcements have been yet made for allowing HTTPS support for custom domains but I am sure that news will arrive soon within next few months. This post consists of a tutorial series that will guide you step by step with all details related to turning on HTTPS in Blogger by taking care of SEO in mind. Note: Click the Button below to see full list of topics under discussion. The basic difference between the two in layman terms is that website URLS which begin with HTTPS are much secure for browsing and transaction purposes compared to websites having HTTP in the URL. The basic difference is Privacy and Protection of the exchanged data between your server computer and your visitors computer. There is no man-in-the-middle for HTTPS connection, which means HTTPS sites are most difficult to hack compared to HTTP hosted sites. Due to these reasons Google now strongly recommends that webmasters may shift to HTTPS to make web more secure for its users. The gift in return that Google will give is a Ranking Boost in search results. We've seen positive results, so we're starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it's only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. HTTPS was previously used by Ecommerce sites or Email delivery sites where confidential information is exchanged but from 2014 onwards it is no more limited to Money transactions or Email delivery, it is gradually being adopted by all major Social media sites, video portals, blogs and corporate sites. As you can notice that Google, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia and many related sites have already upgraded to HTTPS but what about blogs and related CMS? Almost every site uses HTTPS today either in their checkout or registration pages or in side the Comment Login pages. Even all Blogger blogs does use HTTPS already in the comment form which sends data back-and-forth between the browser and Google servers. But very few sites use HTTPS sitewide as indicated by the latest survey from BuiltWith, only 2.6% of the top million sites redirect users to SSL/HTTPS by default and less than 0.1% of all websites in entire internet have switched to HTTPS. Which means the percentage is extremely small but with every year, it will surely increase and will become a must-to-adopt criteria for ranking. I have not seen popular blogs such as Mashable and techCrunch switching to HTTPS yet but SEO blogs like that of MOZ and some News blogs like Life Hacker has already adopted HTTPS. Which means gradually blogs are 301 redirecting their URLS from HTTP to HTTP and it wont be long enough before mashable and techCrunch may join the race because after all its about ranking boost. It's no more about whether or not blogs need a HTTPS encryption but the question is about improvement in search ranking whether you value it or not. So I would really recommend that you shift to HTTPS the moment blogger announces HTTPS support for custom domains as far as .blogspot.com domains are concerned, I will first recommend them to switch to a custom domain to seriously treat blogging and then think of making this SEO shift. A custom domain just costs $10 a year, less than the cost of your daily food expense so why not buy a domain? In my coming tutorials I will share the costs and risks involved with shifting to HTTPS and the solutions to it. If you need help with respect to any concept do post your comment below. Kindly do not switch to HTTPS for your blogSpot blog at present and first wait for coming tutorials to implement it correctly because you can surely loose all your PageRank juice and backlinks if the 301 redirection is not done properly. Peace and blessings buddies! That's good Mustafa.I'm waiting for next part of this post. Thansk Coming tutorials are extremely important and interesting where we will actually explain that why should you avoid applying HTTPS to your .blogspot.com domains at present and better wait for the announcement to be made for custom domains. Thank you for staying tuned buddy => That is an excellent decision. Having a custom domain and then applying all such SEO upgrades makes a lot of sense. I am sure your experience will change threefold after buying a custom domain dear david :) Nice Post Bro ! Really Informative For Newbies Who Don't Know Anything About Encryption's.BTW will you suggest to redirect from http version to https and when i use https version of my blog the green lock is not showing instead just https:// is written.Please Tell Me The Problem :)~Thank You In my next post I will describe why you should avoid turning on HTTPS at this moment and wait for blogger to announce it for custom domains first. As you mentioned there are some redirection errors involved with the current HTTPS settings that blogger offered and I will pin point them in my coming tutorials.At this point, just get more familiar on what HTTPS actually is and how to fix the mixed content issue. We will cover them all in this series dear Nitishk =) Awesome post. I am waiting for continue. HTTPS is yet not available for custom domains in Blogger blogs. The moment they allow it, we will be the first to roll over. =) Blogging made me an entrepreneur & it can bless you too... read full story → © 2008-2023 STCnetwork™, All Rights Reserved.","As 2018 forges on, the importance of HTTPS in Chrome picks up steam. After years of pushing for ‘secure by default’ web sites, Google will now identify insecure sites in the Chrome browser beginning mid-Summer. Designed to ward off ‘man in the middle attacks’, HTTPS protects data while in transit by use of bidirectional encryptions. Over 33% of Alexa’s top 1 million website use HTTPS by default, with 70% of page loads using hypertext transfer protocol secure. As HTTPS utilizes transport layer SSL technology to permit browsing, buying and gaming to be secure, most browsers have made necessary changes to allow HTTPS to exist naturally. Updated X.509 digital certificates provide adequate security through ports 443 or 80, at least in Firefox, Edge and Safari. First invented by Netscape engineers around ’94, top browsing tool Netscape Navigator received the first dose of HTTP pagination on a secured level. It primarily used SSL technology yet quickly adopted TLS (transport layer security) protocols upon RFC 2818’s standardization of HTTP over TLS back in early 2000. RFC established precedence on correct implementation of HTTPS both server-side and client-side, and URI’s were the primary target for proper formatting. Today, HTTPS utilizes most all TLS communications over Port 443 and is written into browsers and server software rudimentarily, although SSL technology still assists in keeping the entire browsing experience safeguarded. Today, HTTPS is a mere formality in the billions of daily requests served between Shanghai and Seattle. But nothing ‘concrete’ by way of security has been rolled out to thwart the usefulness of this secure means of passing data between two points. Aside from your confidentiality and identification, Chrome programmers and website servers should always make reasonable strides to improve the encryption of requests across miles of fiber optic wires. While Firefox and Edge (or Internet Explorer, if you’re old school) have hunkered down on HTTPS, Chrome is starting to lay off – although they shouldn’t. If you wish to share Twitter or Facebook interactions with unidentified sources, feel free to browse with HTTP only – you’ll probably experience your social interactions being hijacked and spread across other internet sites which only intends on harming your usually good persona. Performance of websites accessed by Chrome will always be under scrutiny, whether that chastisement comes from users or other programmers. Since cross-country HTTPS connections require several handshakes and thereby are imposed 200ms penalties, sending HTTP traffic over to secure connections isn’t always plausible. Therefore, cutting down secure sockets layer connections sometimes is the lesser of security evils which programmers much select. So, if your business is located in New York and your request is going to Seattle, expect two full trips of authentication to occur unless the below method of HTTPS masking is implemented into your page schemas. The improvements of requests, and the elimination of ‘request timeout’ altogether reside in the 65% region simply by implementing this load balancing exchange.  It’s tricky and requires some basic coding knowledge of HTTP and TCP/IP protocols yet will drastically cut down on dropped or exposed security. Chrome engineers are learning this quickly. But, as Chrome 69 takes front stage, it may be too little too late. According to news posted on The Verge, Google Chrome will remove the secure indicator from HTTPS sites this September. Will this change in visual cues destroy the browser’s trustworthiness? The search giant acquiesces. Eavesdroppers out to sniff ports or swipe packets have been held at bay. Well, for the most part. Personal blog sites, which normally won’t pass credit card or sensitive personal information between two points, may also benefit from the adoption of HTTPS as Google begins flagging non-HTTPS sites starting in Chrome 68. May seem arbitrary to worry about securing your recipes, but consider this: an SQL injection can wreak havoc in shared hosting environments.

All Rights Reserved","Google Search Console has started sending out notices to sites that have not yet migrated to HTTPS. Chrome 61 is now in beta and version 62 is on track to begin marking HTTP pages as “NOT SECURE” beginning in October. It will show the warning if it detects any forms on the page that transmit passwords, credit cards, or any text input fields that the browser deems are in need of HTTPS protection. All HTTP pages in incognito mode will trigger the warning. In January 2017, Chrome version 56 began marking sites that transmit passwords or credit cards as non-secure as part of its long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure. The warning will become more prominent as time goes on. “Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS,” Chrome Security Team Emily Schechter said. The email sent out from the Google Search Console urges site owners to fix the problem by migrating to HTTPS. Hosting companies that specialize in WordPress are making it easier than ever to make the switch. Many of them have added Let’s Encrypt integration to offer free certificates to customers. As of 2017, WordPress now only recommends hosting partners that provide SSL certificates by default. Thanks to the push towards HTTPS from Google, web browsers, hosting companies, and the 100+ million certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt, the percentage of pageloads over HTTPS is now approaching 60%, according to Firefox Telemetry. This will become very expensive for a lot of people who use web hosts that do not offer LetsEncrypt, but instead charges a lot of money for SSL. Mine charges $75 per site per year, so with multiple sites, this can get expensive. The host I use, and have for many years, makes me cringe to think I may have to move to a new host with LetsEncrypt, but I may have to make that sacrifice and move. The fact people will be seeing these warning messages before entering a site, could end up costing a lot of visitors and money to the site owners. People will be scared off when they see the Not Secure messages. Hosts that don’t support Let’s Encrypt are going to have a harder time competing. There are plenty of hosts out there offering free, automatic SSL certificates that are happy to move new customers off of hosts like yours for free. Yes, Google now forcing webmasters to move to HTTPS. I have also move my site to https and have seen a hike in rankings. I think its a good move to make the web more secure. Absolutely right what Google does to force it to use https! If the lame webmasters don’t do it the fall down in ranking and users get warned because of a not secure website. I think every browser creator should follow that to make the net more secure for us users. I believe that all hosting providers should give every customer the feature to install even Lets Encrypt Open SSL. It’s just the most obvious thing to do. Afterwards, they may provide SSL certificates which provide security compensation. But the fact of the matter of this little rant is that we should go for hosts which provide Lets Encrypt. If you are at a loss wishing to stay with your hosting provider even though they currently don’t provide a free SSL service, then you can always setup your website with CloudFlare, which is free and there is a way to setup HTTPS through reverse proxy. I’ve completed a setup for CloudFlare with my clients and the gains are instant! You’ll also get CloudFlare’s HTTP/2 which is what makes HTTPS fast (not to be confused with HTTP/2). It’s really good move to keep web secure. I don’t see any reason that hosting providers will give a free SSL as they can see Google’s forcing HTTPS as an opportunity to gain in business of selling SSL certificate. Any host that sticks with that strategy will lose new sign ups in the long-run. In a few years it will be laughable that a host is so behind the times that they’re not providing free SSL certificates. They’ll fizzle and die. P.S. Last month I’ve moved 2 websites (1 e-commerce, 1 content-based) and have seen zero changes in rankings. SSL certs are free or it cost under 10$ if somebody wish to pay it. Sure you saw zero ranking changes, it’s a standard already, nothing new or rarely seen, that will diff. you from other websites. Looks like somebody missed the memo on Let’s Encrypt. If you’re paying 30-100 for ssl, you’re paying too much. Even wildcard certs will be free soon. I don’t think anybody’s going to need to pay for anything unless they want something like an EV cert. I recently launched a tech blog, and come on, I don’t want to use HTTPS on that. This is not good, my tech blog is just about guides and tips, I have nothing to do with secure access like logging in or even putting any delicate information on my blog. That’s pretty… bad. :( Consider that the transmission of your password is not encrypted when you log into /wp-admin/ over http. Yes, that was a helpful reply. Thank you for that. I have to agree with Bright Joe here. There is no intrinsic need for a security certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) on a website that is simply a blog, especially if it is just plain HTML… without any data capture. If you are really concerned about security, use a VPN and not rely on SSL. There is a bit of overhead to it, but it is about as secure as you can get. Of course, bank/financial and medical, and similar sites that collect personal info should be protected… and I can’t think of one that isn’t these days (making a VPN somewhat redundant.) No one has explained to me why Google is on the road to requiring Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for every website… but I have to surmise that there is a dollar sign behind their motivation somewhere. Do they own a CA somewhere? If your host allows it you can easily install Let’s Encrypt using their CertBot. However, some hosts don’t give you root permission and CertBot needs it. If that is the case, many hosts have a manual way for you to get a Let’s Encrypt certificate and sending it to them and they will install it for free. We use this site and it works well. For those of you who host on Pair.com as we do, we wrote this…   actually for ourselves… so we would not forget how to do the procedure!! The downside with hosts that don’t support Let’s Encrypt internally is that the host (obviously) can’t auto-renew the certificates and they expire every 3 months… so you have to do the procedure 4 times a year. Perhaps paying the ten bucks a year is a better idea… but if you have some 20 domains as we do for our different businesses, maybe not. It does not take very long but it is a PITA, for sure. I use CloudFlare’s flexible SSL with no charge. I understand it is not a complete SSL and I wonder if Google will still display the message for my site. It’s pretty clear that a lot of education about HTTPS/SSL needs to be done. I’m really glad Google is making this an unavoidable issue.

what are the chief characteristics of a cactus,"A cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales. The word ""cactus"" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north -- except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.","Buy now for $4,595 or pay $191.46 per month for 24 months Start using the domain today.

what is the definition of star crossed lovers,"""Star-crossed"" or ""star-crossed lovers"" is a phrase describing a pair of lovers whose relationship is often thwarted by outside forces. The term encompasses other meanings, but originally means the pairing is being ""thwarted by a malign star"" or that the stars are working against the relationship. Astrological in origin, the phrase stems from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people's fates, and is best known from the play Romeo and Juliet by the Elizabethan playwright William Shakespeare. Such pairings are often said to be doomed from the start.","“There are very few people that have escaped my eye. It was only when I finished my career did I realize what I’d done. I’ve done the best people ever. And there will never be people to match them. Ever.” Terry O’Neill began his career working in a photographic unit for an airline at London’s Heathrow Airport. During this time, he photographed a sleeping figure in a waiting area whom, by happenstance, was revealed to be Britain’s Home Secretary. O’Neill thereafter found further employment on Fleet Street with The Daily Sketch in 1959. His first professional job was photographing Laurence Olivier. His reputation grew during the 1960s. In addition to photographing the decade’s show-business elite such as Judy Garland, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, he also photographed members of the British Royal Family and prominent politicians, showing a more natural and human side to these subjects than had usually been portrayed before. O’Neill had a longtime relationship with Faye Dunaway. They were married from 1983 until 1986. Terry O’Neill rose to fame in the 1960’s in London, where he snapped this photo of the Beatles at Abbey Road, during the year they released their three classic albums, Please, Please… Me, Introducing the Beatles and With the Beatles. This image hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London The Rolling Stones outside St. George’s Church in Hanover Square, London, 17th January 1964 “Because I used to be a jazz musician, people at the paper asked me, ‘You know about music, who’s going to be the next pop group?’ I said, ‘I’ve been watching a group called The Rolling Stones. They’re a blues group but they’re good’. I went to photograph them and they [the newspaper editors] were horrified. They thought they looked like five prehistoric monsters. They said, ‘There’s got to be some good-looking ones!’” Singer David Bowie sharing a cigarette with actress Elizabeth Taylor in Beverly Hills, 1975.

The term encompasses other meanings, but originally means the pairing is being “thwarted by a malign star” or that the stars are working against the relationship. Astrological in origin, the phrase stems from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people’s fates, and is best known from the play Romeo and Juliet by the Elizabethan playwright William Shakespeare. Such pairings are often but not always said to be doomed from the start. A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life” (5–6). It also refers to destiny and the inevitability of the two characters’ paths crossing each other. It usually but not always refers to unlucky outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet’s affair ended tragically. Further, it connotes that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation; that the lovers may not have had adequate knowledge of each other or that they were not thinking rationally. Examples of famous star-crossed lovers vary in written work. Pyramus and Thisbe are usually regarded as the source for Romeo and Juliet, featured in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights are considered one of the greatest love stories in literary works. In Wuthering Heights, the narrative tells the tale of the all-encompassing and passionate, yet thwarted, love between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and how this unresolved passion eventually destroys them and many around them. The Parting of Lancelot and Guinevere, Julia Margaret Cameron, 1874. Albumen silver print from glass negative. David Hunter McAlpin Fund, 1952 Lancelot and Guinevere are often remembered for their affair. Guinevere was the queen of Camelot and wife of King Arthur, while Lancelot was a trusted knight of Arthur’s Round Table. In some versions of the tale, she is instantly smitten, and when they consummate their adulterous passion, it is an act which paves the way for the fall of Camelot and Arthur’s death. The legend of Tristan and Iseult (also known as Tristan and Isolde) is an influential romance and tragedy, retold in numerous sources with as many variations. The tragic story is of the adulterous love between the lovers. The narrative predates and most likely influenced the Arthurian romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, and has had a substantial impact on Western art and literature since it first appeared in the 12th century. While the details of the story differ from one author to another, the overall plot structure remains much the same. Hero and Leander is a Greek myth, relating the story of Hero (Greek: Ἡρώ), a priestess of Aphrodite who dwelt in a tower in Sestos, at the edge of the Hellespont, and Leander (Greek: Λέανδρος, Leandros), a young man from Abydos on the other side of the strait. Leander fell in love with Hero and would swim every night across the Hellespont to be with her. Hero would light a lamp at the top of her tower to guide his way. Pelléas and Mélisande (French: Pelléas et Mélisande) is a Symbolist play by Maurice Maeterlinck about the forbidden, doomed love of the title characters. A classical myth, was a common subject for art during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Troilus and Cressida is a tragedy by Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1602. The play (also described as one of Shakespeare’s problem plays) is not a conventional tragedy, since its protagonist (Troilus) does not die.The play ends instead on a very bleak note with the death of the noble Trojan Hector and destruction of the love between Troilus and Cressida.Venus and Adonis is classical myth during the Renaissance. Heer Ranjha is one of the four popular tragic romances of the Punjab. The fainting of Laylah and Majnun, Author unknown, c. 1550-1600 Layla and Majnun ( by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi) is a classical Arabian love story . It is based on the real story of a young man called Qays ibn al-Mulawwah from the northern Arabian Peninsula, in the Umayyad era during the 7th century. There were two Arabic versions of the story at the time. In one version, he spent his youth together with Layla, tending their flocks. In the other version, upon seeing Layla he fell passionately in love with her. In both versions, however, he went mad when her father prevented him from marrying her; for that reason he came to be called Majnun Layla, which means “Driven mad by Layla”. To him were attributed a variety of incredibly passionate romantic Arabic poems, considered among the foremost examples of the Udhari school. The Butterfly Lovers is a Chinese legend about the tragic romance between two lovers, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. The legend is sometimes regarded as the Chinese equivalent to Romeo and Juliet. Other classic star-crossed lovers include Devdas and Paro (Parvati) in Devdas, Paris of Troy and Helen of Sparta in The Iliad, Oedipus and Jocasta in Oedipus the King, Mark Antony and Cleopatra during the time of the Roman Empire, Khosrow and Shirin during the time of Sassanid Persia, Heloise and Peter Abelard during the Middle Ages, and Emperor Jahangir and Anarkali, Cyrano and Roxane in Cyrano de Bergerac, Hagbard and Signy and Maratha Peshwa (Prime Minister) Bajirao and Mastani during the peak of Maratha Empire. “To be, or not to be” is the famous opening phrase of a soliloquy in William Shakespeare‘s play Hamlet. Debate surrounds its meaning, and that of the speech, but most agree that it asks the fundamental question “why live?” and gives the desolate answer that death might be worse. Hamlet speaks this on his entry to Act 3 scene 1 (known as the ‘nunnery scene’ because of the Hamlet/Ophelia dialogue after the speech) which is when Polonius and Claudius put into effect their plan, hatched in Act 2 scene 2, to watch Hamlet with Ophelia to determine whether, as Polonius thinks, his ‘madness’ springs from “neglected love”. They have planted her where it is his habit to walk and think and concealed themselves to observe the encounter. Until he notices Ophelia at the end of the speech Hamlet thinks he is alone.

In February, 1925 he successfully presented his production in London despite the so-called apathy extended toward American Shakespearean actors in Britain. Laurence Olivier’s 1948 moody black-and-white Hamlet won best picture and best actor Oscars, and is still, as of 2013, the only Shakespeare film to have done so.

The game begins with each player being assigned a number, in secret, with the highest number corresponding to the number of players. For example, if five people are playing, each player will be assigned one of the numbers one through five. A player is chosen as ‘It.’ The person who is ‘it’ stands in the approximate center of the playing area, with one foot in front of the other. All of the other players must then touch one of their feet to its inward foot, and then step backwards three paces. This 3-step-backward set-up is required. When all of the players have stepped backward three paces, the person who is ‘it’ throws the ball straight into the air and calls the number of another player. The ball must be thrown straight up. In political theory, the horseshoe theory asserts that the far left and the far right, rather than being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear political continuum, in fact closely resemble one another, much like the ends of a horseshoe. The theory is attributed to French writer Jean-Pierre Faye. Proponents of the theory point to a number of similarities between the far-left and the far-right, including their supposed propensity to gravitate to authoritarianism or totalitarianism. The horseshoe theory competes with the conventional linear left–right continuum system as well as the various multidimensional systems. Deez Nuts was a satirical candidate, portrayed by 15-year-old Brady C. Olson of Wallingford, Iowa, who ran in the 2016 United States presidential election. In polls conducted by Public Policy Polling in Iowa, Minnesota, and North Carolina in mid-August 2015, he polled at 8, 8, and 9-percent respectively, garnering the attention of the media. On October 11, 2015, Deez Nuts announced on his Facebook page his intention to run for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, citing his eligibility despite not being a member of the House itself and the scarcity of candidates. A poll performed in mid-August 2016 shows Deez Nuts slightly edging out Harambe (a gorilla killed that year at the Cincinnati Zoo) and Green Party candidate Jill Stein in Texas, with 3% of the vote. Deez Nuts was endorsed by the man behind the original ‘Deez Nuts’ skit, hip-hop artist Warren G. Rapper Ice T also endorsed the candidate. Yacht rock (originally known as the ‘West Coast Sound’) is a broad music style and aesthetic identified with soft rock. The term, coined in the 2000s by the makers of the online video series of the same name, was derived from its association with the popular Southern Californian leisure activity of sailing. The term describes one of the commercially successful genres of its era, existing between the late 1970s and early 1980s. Drawing on sources such as smooth soul, smooth jazz, R&B, funk, and disco, common stylistic traits include high-quality production, clean vocals, and a focus on light, catchy melodies. The genre is often described as having ‘more emphasis on the melody than on the beat’ and ‘light emotions.’ A Little League home run is a play in baseball during which a batter scores a run during his plate appearance with the aid of one or more errors committed by the fielding team. It is so called because the play is presumably evocative of how young children in the process of learning how to play the sport frequently commit fielding and throwing errors that allow batters (as well as runners already on base during the at bat) to take more bases than they might otherwise normally take on the batted ball put into play. The term stems from Little League Baseball, founded in 1939 as an organizing body for local youth baseball and softball leagues throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Tim’s Vermeer is a 2013 documentary film, directed by Teller (of the comedy magic duo Penn & Teller), produced by his stage partner Penn Jillette and film producer Farley Ziegler, about inventor Tim Jenison’s efforts to duplicate the painting techniques of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, in order to test his theory that Vermeer painted with the help of optical devices. Tim Jenison is the founder of NewTek, a company working in various fields of computer graphics, most notably the 3D modelling software ‘LightWave 3D.’ Jenison, himself both an engineer and art enthusiast, becomes fascinated with the paintings of Johannes Vermeer, the 17th-century Dutch painter, whose paintings have been described as having a photographic quality to them. ‘Star-crossed‘ or ‘star-crossed lovers’ is a phrase describing a pair of lovers whose relationship is often thwarted by outside forces.

what does tight end position in football do,"Because of the hybrid nature of the position, the tight end's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes. Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking in running situations while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations.",,,,,,,,,,
when does a star leave the main sequence,"In general, the more massive a star is, the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, the star evolves away from the main sequence on the HR diagram. The behavior of a star now depends on its mass, with stars below 0.23 M becoming white dwarfs directly, whereas stars with up to ten solar masses pass through a red giant stage. More massive stars can explode as a supernova, or collapse directly into a black hole.","Main sequence is the class name for stars that occupy a continuous distinctive band formed by plotting stellar color versus brightness for a large sample of stars. These color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Main sequence stars are normal stars, but due to historical factors they are also known as dwarf stars. Other ""dwarf"" stars that are not main sequence stars include white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. After a star has formed, it generates energy at its hot, dense core through the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. During this stage, the star is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also by its chemical composition and other factors. In general, the more massive the star, the shorter its time on the main sequence. The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the processes that stars use to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun (or 1.5 solar masses) fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the proton-proton chain. Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process can instead use atoms of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen as intermediaries in the production of helium from hydrogen atoms. Astronomers' development and use of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams is a good example of one of the approaches used by scientists in their efforts to discover the underlying order and principles of the natural world. When faced with an abundance of data (such as the measurements and analysis of radiation from myriads of stars), scientists identify criteria (in this case, brightness and color) that seem significant, define the criteria in scientifically measurable terms (in this case, absolute magnitude and color index), plot the data on an appropriately scaled graph, and look for a pattern. In this case, the pattern is the main sequence, which has proven to be a valuable guide for theoreticians as they have developed conceptual and mathematical models of stellar evolution. In the early part of the twentieth century, information about the types and distances of stars became more readily available. The spectra of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C. Pickering at Harvard College Observatory had developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard classification scheme. This scheme was published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.[1] In Potsdam in 1906, the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups. These stars are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them ""giant"" and ""dwarf"" stars. The following year he began studying star clusters; large groupings of stars that are co-located at approximately the same distance. He published the first plots of color versus luminosity for these stars. These plots showed a prominent and continuous sequence of stars, which he named the main sequence.[2] At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was following a similar course of research. He was studying the relationship between the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.[3] Of the red stars observed by Hertzsprung, the dwarf stars also followed the spectra-luminosity relationship discovered by Russell. However, the giant stars are much brighter than dwarfs and so do not follow the same relationship. Russell proposed that the ""giant stars must have low density or great surface-brightness, and the reverse is true of dwarf stars."" The same curve also showed that there were very few faint white stars.[3] In 1933, Bengt Strömgren introduced the term Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram.[4] This name reflected the parallel development of this technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.[2] As evolutionary models of stars were developed during the 1930s, it was shown that, for stars of a uniform chemical composition, a relationship exists between a star's mass and its luminosity and radius. That is, for a given mass and composition is known, there is a unique solution determining the star's radius and luminosity. This became known as the Vogt-Russell theorem; named after Heinrich Vogt and Henry Norris Russell. By this theorem, once a star's chemical composition and its position on the main sequence is known, so too is the star's mass and radius. (However, it was subsequently discovered that the theorem breaks down somewhat for stars of non-uniform composition.)[5] A refined scheme for stellar classification was published in 1943 by W. W. Morgan and P. C. Keenan.[6] The MK classification assigned each star a spectral type—based on the Harvard classification—and a luminosity class. For historical reasons, the spectral types of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K and M. (A popular mnemonic for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is ""Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me."") The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.[7] When a protostar is formed from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass.[8] During the initial collapse, this pre-main sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.[7] Once nuclear fusion of hydrogen becomes the dominant energy production process and the excess energy gained from gravitational contraction has been lost,[9] the star lies along a curve on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (or HR diagram) called the standard main sequence. Astronomers will sometimes refer to this stage as ""zero age main sequence,"" or ZAMS.[10] The ZAMS curve can be calculated using computer models of stellar properties at the point when stars begin hydrogen fusion. From this point, the brightness and surface temperature of stars typically increase with age.[11] A star remains near its initial position on the main sequence until a significant amount of hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and to the right of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.[7] Main sequence stars have been extensively studied through stellar models, allowing their formation and evolutionary history to be relatively well understood. The position of the star on the main sequence provides information about its physical properties. The majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main sequence curve. This line is so pronounced because both the spectral type and the luminosity depend only on a star's mass, at least to zeroth order approximation, as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most of their ""active"" life doing.[12] These main-sequence (and therefore ""normal"") stars are called dwarf stars. This is not because they are unusually small, but instead comes from their smaller radii and lower luminosity as compared to the other main category of stars, the giant stars.[13] White dwarfs are a different kind of star that are much smaller than main sequence stars—being roughly the size of the Earth. These represent the final evolutionary stage of many main sequence stars.[14] The temperature of a star determines its spectral type, because the energy modifies the physical properties of the plasma in the photosphere. Both the temperature and composition determines the star's energy emission at different wavelengths. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the color index, B—V, which measures the star's magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. (By measuring the difference between these values, one can eliminate the need to correct the magnitudes for distance.) Thus, this difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star's temperature. Because there is a temperature gradient between the core of a star and its surface, energy is steadily transported upward through the intervening layers until it is radiated away at the photosphere. The two mechanisms used to carry this energy through the star are radiation and convection, with the type used depending on the local conditions. Convection tends to occur in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both. When convection occurs in the core region it acts to stir up the helium ashes, thus maintaining the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur. where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. As the position of a star on the HR diagram shows its approximate luminosity, this relation can be used to estimate its radius.[15] After the hydrogen fuel at the core of the main sequence star has been consumed, the star evolves away from the main sequence on the HR diagram. The behavior of a star now depends on its mass, with stars below 0.23 solar masses becoming white dwarfs, while stars with up to 10 solar masses pass through a red giant stage.[16] More massive stars can explode as a Type II supernova.[17] The table below shows typical values for stars along the main sequence. The values of luminosity (L), radius (R) and mass (M) are relative to the Sun—a dwarf star with a spectral classification of G2 V. The actual values for a star may vary by as much as 20–30 percent from the values listed below.[18] All main sequence stars have a core region where energy is generated by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of the star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.[24] Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant type of fusion process at the core. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficient mass to use the CNO cycle to fuse hydrogen into helium. This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is generated as the result of the proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium.[25] At a stellar core temperature of 18 million kelvins, both fusion processes are equally efficient. As this is the core temperature of a star with 1.5 solar masses, the upper main sequence consists of stars above this mass. The apparent upper limit for a main sequence star is 120–200 solar masses.[26] Stars above this mass can not radiate energy fast enough to remain stable, so any additional mass will be ejected in a series of pulsations until the star reaches a stable limit.[27] The lower limit for sustained nuclear fusion is about 0.08 solar masses.[25] Because there is a temperature difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and there is very little mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.[28][24] In massive stars (above 10 solar masses)[29] the rate of energy generation by the CNO cycle is very sensitive to temperature, so the fusion is highly concentrated at the core. Consequently, there is a high temperature gradient in the core region, which results in a convection zone for more efficient energy transport.[25] This mixing of material around the core removes the helium ash from the hydrogen burning region, allowing more of the hydrogen in the star to be consumed during the main sequence lifetime. The outer regions of a massive star transport energy by radiation, with little or no convection.[24] Intermediate mass stars such as Sirius may transport energy primarily by radiation, with a small core convection region.[30] Medium-sized, low mass stars like the Sun have a core region that is stable against convection, with a convection zone near the surface that mixes the outer layers. This results in a steady buildup of a helium-rich core, surrounded by a hydrogen-rich outer region. By contrast, cool, very low-mass stars (below 0.4 solar masses) are convective throughout.[31] Thus, the helium produced at the core is distributed across the star, producing a relatively uniform atmosphere and a proportionately longer main sequence lifespan.[24] As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in the core of a main sequence star, the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. To compensate, the core temperature and pressure slowly increase, which causes a net increase in the overall fusion rate (to support the greater density of the inner star). This produces a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time.[11] Thus, for example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70 percent of its current value.[32] As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime.[33] Other factors that broaden the main sequence band on the HR diagram include uncertainty in the distance to stars and the presence of unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. In addition to variations in chemical composition—both because of the initial abundances and the star's evolutionary status,[34] interaction with a close companion,[35] rapid rotation,[36] or a magnetic field can also change a main sequence star's position slightly on the HR diagram, to name just a few factors. As an example, there are stars that have a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium—known as metal-poor stars—that lie just below the main sequence. Known as subdwarfs, these stars are also fusing hydrogen in their core and so they mark the lower edge of the main sequence's fuzziness resulting from chemical composition.[37] A nearly vertical region of the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the upper part of the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Main sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect.[38] The total amount of energy that a star can generate through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited by the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.[39] For a star with at least 0.5 solar masses, once the hydrogen supply in its core is exhausted and it expands to become a red giant, it can start to fuse helium atoms to form carbon. As the energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process, this stage will only last for about 10 percent of a star's total active lifetime. Thus, about 90 percent of the observed stars above 0.5 solar masses will be on the main sequence.[40] On average, main sequence stars are known to follow an empirical mass-luminosity relationship.[41] The luminosity (L) of the star is roughly proportional to the total mass (M) as the following power law: The amount of fuel available for nuclear fusion is proportional to the mass of the star. Thus, the lifetime of a star on the main sequence can be estimated by comparing it to solar evolutionary models. The Sun has been a main sequence star for about 4.5 billion years and it will become a red giant in 6.5 billion years,[42] for a total main sequence lifetime of roughly 1010 years. Hence:[39][43] This is a counter-intuitive result, as more massive stars have more fuel to burn and might be expected to last longer. Instead, the most massive stars may remain on the main sequence for only a few million years, while stars with less than a tenth of a solar mass may last for over a trillion years.[44] For massive stars, however, this mass-luminosity relationship poorly matches the estimated lifetime. A more accurate representation gives a different function for various ranges of mass. The exact mass-luminosity relationship depends on how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star does not need to produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium.[45] Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.[11] In high mass main sequence stars, the opacity is dominated by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass.[46] For stars below 10 times the solar mass, the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass.[47] For very low mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere also contribute to the opacity. Below about 0.5 solar masses, the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.[48] Once a main sequence star consumes the hydrogen at its core, the loss of energy generation causes gravitational collapse to resume. For stars with less than 0.23 solar masses,[16] energy generation by nuclear fusion comes to a halt and it becomes a white dwarf. (The star now migrates to the lower left on the HR diagram.) For higher mass stars with up to 10 solar masses, the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, turning it into a red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path the star now follows across the HR diagram is called an evolutionary track. The helium core of a red giant continues to collapse until it is entirely supported by electron degeneracy pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that restricts how closely matter can be compacted. For stars of more than about 0.5 solar masses,[49] the core can reach a temperature where it becomes hot enough to burn helium into carbon via the triple alpha process.[50][51] Stars with at least four solar masses can also fuse elements with higher atomic numbers. For stars with ten solar masses, this process can lead to a cataclysmic explosion as a Type II supernova.[17] When a cluster of stars is formed at about the same time, the life span of these stars will depend on their individual masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.[52] All links retrieved November 5, 2022.

The strike was also Ghana's first ever goal in the FIFA World Cup, coming in the game against the Czech Republic on 17 June at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Germany, which set the Black Stars on their way to a 2 -- 0 victory. He missed a penalty later in the game, and received a yellow card ruling him out of the final group game for trying to take the penalty too early. In Ghana's defeat to Brazil in the round of 16, he was sent off in the 81st minute after collecting his second booking of the match (for diving).",,,,,,,,,,
what is the difference on the molecular level between the pure metal and the alloy,"An alloy is a mixture of two or more elements in which the main component is a metal. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of making alloys is generally to make them less brittle, harder, resistant to corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steel) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels, with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and toughness. The addition of silicon will produce cast irons, while the addition of chromium, nickel and molybdenum to carbon steels (more than 10%) results in stainless steels.","One of our academic counsellors will contact you within 1 working day. A metal that exists in metallic form, either as pure metal or as an alloy. For example, cadmium, cobalt, bismuth, indium etc. Two group of metals are found in nature. They are classified on the basis of their nature of existence, that is, whether they exists single or in alloys- The gold group consists of gold, copper, lead, aluminum, mercury, and silver. The platinum group consists of platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium. Aluminum is the most abundant element in nature. It is a major constituent of silica and clay. Iron is the second largest metal that exists in nature after aluminum. The process of extracting metals from ores is known as Smelting which was discovered around 6500 BC. It is a mixture of two or more elements in which the major component is metal. Alloys are made to obtain desirable characteristics. The basic idea to make alloy is to make metal less brittle, hard and more resistant to corrosion. Alloys of iron is important in both quantity and commercial value. For example, stainless steel, cast iron, alloy steel etc. Iron alloyed with carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. Increase in carbon content reduces ductility and toughness. The addition of silicon to iron produces cast irons, whereas the addition of chromium, nickel and molybdenum to carbon steels results in stainless steels. The alloys of aluminum, titanium, and magnesium are valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios, and magnesium can also provide electromagnetic shielding. These alloys are used in jet engines. Ore is a naturally occurring material from which a metal can be extracted. They are extracted from the earth by the process of mining. Fig. 1. Some Common Ores 1.   Prospecting or exploration- This is the first step in which the extent and value of ore where it is located is defined 2.   Conduct resource estimation-This is  to estimate the size and grade of the deposit. 3.   Conduct a pre-feasibility study -This is done to know about the practicality of the proposed idea. 4.   Conduct a feasibility study – This is to evaluate the financial viability, technical and financial risks associated with the project. 5.   Development- This step is used for building mine plant and equipment needed. 6.   The operation of the mine in an active sense 7.   Reclamation is the last step in which land is made suitable for future use. Fig. 2. Metals and their Method of Extraction Q1. Which metal is found in free state in nature? Sol. Only gold, silver, copper, and the platinum metals occur in nature in larger amounts. They are less reactive in nature, so occur free. Amongst the alloys found in native state are brass, bronze, pewter, German silver, etc. Q2. Is metal natural? Sol.

Gravel can be used in a variety of ways in your garden design and is an excellent addition to your soil. It can be used as a stepping stone, a mulch, a weed barrier, or simply to break up tough weeds and grass clippings. How to Select the Right Gravel For Your Garden Most gardens have different needs. A flower garden will usually require gravel that has a fine texture, and does not have a lot of character. On the other hand, a vegetable garden will usually need a coarse gravel to define its edging. As far as the color of gravel is concerned, pale gravel goes well with all colors of flowers and everything else in a garden. To help you select the correct gravel, there are a few things that you should consider. The first thing that you need to consider is the size of the gravel that you will use. There are some considerations for this. If you have a small flower garden, then you may want to choose a larger size gravel to help define your flowerbed. On the other hand, if you have a large garden, then you might want to choose a smaller size gravel to ensure that you do not over-water it. In order to select the correct size, you will need to take these factors into consideration. How to Select the Right Gravel for Your Garden When you are learning how to select the right gravel for your garden, you will need to learn about the various types of gravel that you can use. You can choose from natural stones, pebbles, or even pre-cast concrete. Natural stones are the easiest type to work with, as they are easy to shape and come in a wide range of shapes. However, pebbles and concrete are much harder to work with, but are much more durable when it comes to resisting the elements. How to Select the Right Gravel For Your Garden In order to know how to select the right gravel for your garden, you will need to learn about what you want in your gravel. It should have the proper drainage rates. It should also be easy to clean, which will require some research into the types of grout and cleaners that you will need. Most importantly, you should make sure that the gravel you choose is going to stay in place and not become dislodged over time. How to Choose the Right Gravel for Your Garden You should also learn about what colors and textures your gravel needs to have. Different colors will work better for different areas. The texture should work well with any mulch and the drainage rate should work well with water. The best way to go about finding this out is by shopping around at home stores and garden stores. Look at the lots that are available and see which ones have the materials you will need to create the perfect gravel. How to Select the Right Gravel for Your Garden Once you know how to select the right gravel for your garden, you can start to build your very own. If you are not a natural raker, you may want to consider using some artificial products. You can find these in the garden store and even in some hardware stores. They will let you know how to create the perfect look for your driveway and will also let you know what kind of gravel would work best in your area. How to Select the Right Gravel for Your Garden It may take some time to get everything together, but once it is in place you will be able to use it time again without worry. Your gravel can be used for parking lots, walkways and just about anything else you might need it for. Make sure that it is not only appealing, but also sturdy enough for your purposes. If you need some assistance in selecting the right gravel for your needs, you can contact a local company that specializes in landscape construction.

Electrical contractors are responsible for the installation, maintenance and repair of electrical systems and machinery. They may work in commercial, residential or industrial environments. Their jobs require expertise in a wide range of disciplines, and they typically have specialized licenses or certifications to perform their work safely. Electricians and electrical contractors have many similarities, but there are some key differences as well. The former is more likely to focus on the labor aspect of a project, while the latter is more involved with collaborating with architects click here and other construction professionals to design building systems. The first step toward becoming an electrical contractor is to obtain a license from your local government. This is a requirement in most states, and it can help ensure that your work is safe. In addition to licensing, you will need to meet experience requirements, which can vary by state. Electrical contracting requires compliance with various regulations to prevent accidents, injuries and deaths from occurring on a job site. In addition, your business should be covered by liability and property insurance to protect against any financial losses that result from a lawsuit. In the state of New York, electrical contractors must have a license from the city, county or municipality where they conduct business. They can apply for a license by completing an application process that includes a written exam and practical exam. Once approved, they must display their license on the door of their business or in their shop. There are several organizations for electrical contractors, including the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). These associations offer training and apprenticeship programs as well as a host of other services to help members thrive in their profession. Whether working directly with clients or with colleagues, electrical contractors often need to communicate complex information to their team members and other stakeholders. This requires clear, concise, and accurate communication. Because electricians spend a lot of time standing, kneeling or bending, it’s important that they are in good shape. A strong work ethic and a commitment to health and safety are also essential qualities in this profession. In today’s highly regulated industry, it’s increasingly common for electrical contractors to utilize prefabricated components and materials that can reduce the risk of errors or injuries while minimizing costs. This is often referred to as “prefabbing.” One of the major benefits of prefabrication is that it eliminates waste in the supply chain. Since a project’s components are prefabricated in a clean and organized factory setting, there is less material to transport and assemble on the job site. This can save time and money, as well as make a project more productive overall. While electrical contracting can be a rewarding career, it can be dangerous. Because of the complexity of their work, electrical contractors are exposed to many risks that can impact their livelihood. Managing team members is a challenging task that requires leaders to be skilled at communicating effectively and instilling trust. While it may seem intimidating at first, there are ways to successfully lead your team and help them achieve success. Whether you manage a team that’s close to home or spread out across the country, it’s important to stay in touch with them regularly. This allows you to build relationships, assess progress, and identify risks or issues that may affect their work. 2. Make a point of checking in with them at least once or twice a week. Keeping in regular contact with your team Richard W Warke is crucial to maintaining their engagement and productivity. This can be done through brief, 10-15 minute check-in conversations or by scheduling calendar openings that allow them to connect with you if they need any assistance. Providing positive feedback is an essential part of effective communication, and it’s especially important when you’re a new team leader. Be sure to praise your team when they do a great job and offer constructive criticism when they need to improve their work or be more productive. As a team leader, you’re responsible for helping each team member understand how their individual strengths and experiences contribute to the company’s success. This is not always easy to do, but you can set a good example by showing how to appreciate others’ skills and abilities. 5. Create a respectful culture emphasizing positive interactions between team members and management. No one likes to be on a team that doesn’t treat each other with respect, so it’s important for you to go out of your way to model what you want the culture to be. This can be done through setting clear expectations and outlining measures of success that your team can easily recognize and follow. Successful team leadership requires that you constantly motivate your team to be the best they can be. This can be accomplished by offering rewards that encourage high-level performance such as bonuses and pay increases. 7. Delegate projects and tasks to team members when appropriate. When you’re new to leading a team, it can be tempting to take on everything yourself, but that is not the most effective way of working. It can also be overwhelming and frustrating for team members. Once you’ve decided on a project or task to delegate, make it clear to the team how you expect it to be completed and when. This will encourage your team to complete the task on time and with success, which can increase your team’s trust in you and make them more willing to share their expertise and skills. Regardless of the size of your team, it’s important to provide your team with the support and resources they need to succeed. This can include technical knowledge, training materials, time off for sick leave or vacations, and even help in resolving problems or issues they’re experiencing.

They offer a range of moving services from packing, to delivering and unpacking your belongings at the new location. They are registered with FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) and have a large fleet of trucks to handle your needs. Increasingly, wildlife populations are suffering Grizzly Moving as they struggle to survive against the growing pressures of exurban development. They are being displaced from their habitats, even when the number of people entering the landscape is relatively low, according to a pair of scientific studies recently published by two scientists. The first, in a study that compared bear movement between backcountry management units (BMUs) that were closed to human access and BMUs where people were allowed to enter, found that grizzlies were twice as likely to move when humans were present. They were also more likely to reoccupy a backcountry area if they were moved, and had more extensive home ranges than bears who were already living in the landscape. While the study was conducted in Yellowstone National Park, its conclusions apply to grizzlies across the continent and could lead to greater numbers of bears finding their way into wild lands once considered unsuitable for them. The authors of the study, Sarah Milligan and Darren McLellan, are based at the University of Montana in Bozeman. Their results suggest that in the years ahead, many more wildlands in and out of existing grizzly recovery areas will need to be reclaimed if bears are going to survive and thrive. It’s a challenge that could exacerbate a cascade of impacts, including climate change and increasing pressures from states rights proponents who want to minimize the amount of terrain grizzlies are allowed to re-occupy. Another set of findings, in a study that tracked grizzly movement across three national forests, showed how exurban development in the Big Sky region – located between the Custer Gallatin, Beaverhead-Deerlodge and Caribou-Targhee National Forests – has led to increased bear populations being removed from the Madison Mountains. The number of homes built in this part of the state, which has been heavily developed over decades, has ballooned and the number of people using adjacent public lands is soaring. Despite a decade of optimism that conservationists would be able to restore bear populations to their historic range, recent developments are undermining their ability to succeed. The cumulative effects of sprawl and development, combined with increasingly hostile state management policies, are undermining grizzly connectivity, said Dr. Christopher Servheen, who for 35 years was the leader of grizzly bear recovery efforts for the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana. Servheen’s warnings come as state legislatures are passing bills that could undermine grizzly conservation and, in turn, their prospects for sustained recovery. One such measure, enacted in Montana, prohibits the relocation of grizzlies that wander into an expanding grid of exurbia, a policy that would normally give bears additional chances to survive in wild lands in and out of existing recovery areas.

There is likewise strong evidence that CBD can assist deal with seizures in individuals with epilepsy. In fact, in 2018, the FDA accepted a prescription drug called Epidiolex that contains CBD to deal with epilepsy. CBD has been revealed to have antipsychotic effects in pets, and also is being studied as a possible treatment for schizophrenia and also various other mental illnesses. Some researches suggest it can assist with drug addiction, PTSD as well as anxiety problems. It is additionally assumed that CBD can help with a series of various other issues, such as heart problem and cancer. Although the clinical information is limited, it has actually been shown to have anti-inflammatory residential properties and can promote cellular regeneration after injury. Inflammation is a contributing variable to many health problems, from cardiovascular disease and also cancer cells to diabetes.

It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try a search? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.","Steel is basically an alloy of iron and carbon to which sometimes other elements are added to achieve certain properties for specific performance of the steel. It is the most common material which the people come into contact with every moment, all the day and every day. There is hardly any object that people use today which does not contain steel or which is not created with equipment made of steel. In fact, today it is hard to imagine a life without the use of steel in some shape or form.  One has to just think of what would be missing in everyday life if there is no steel. Mass production of steel started late in the nineteenth century. From that time onwards steel has become the material of choice in most of the applications which make the daily lives of the people possible. This position of steel is due to its versatility, strength, and recyclability. The versatility of steel is well known. It can be used in diverse applications which includes transportation, infrastructure, building structures etc. on one side and sewing needles, screws for laptops, mother board sheets for mobile phones, springs for wrist watches and many others such smaller applications. Ballpoint pens rely on a steel sphere less than 1 mm in diameter to dispense ink. Steel can also be used in a wide variety of atmospheres which include extremes of cold and hot climates as well as in both arid and wet climates. World today depends on the strength of steel. Steel makes it possible to build skyscrapers and long span bridges since it has strength, rigidity and durability. Tankers and bulk carriers which help in moving resources across the world are made of steel. Wind mills and solar farms which generate renewable energy are dependent on steel for their existence. Similarly, aircraft undercarriages rely on steel to perform every time an airplane takes off and lands. Use of steel is indispensable while meeting the challenge of efficient use of the resources. There are limitless possibilities in the usage of steel. Its strength-to-weight ratio is the highest of any building material. It can be easily formed and joined. It can withstand natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes. It is also impervious to attacks from termites or fungi. There are several thousands of different varieties of steels with different properties. In addition, new steels are being developed every year. The large variety of steels which are being made for use in different applications can be broadly categorized in the following types. Carbon steel is the most common type of steel. Steel is considered to be carbon steel (i) when no minimum content is specified or required for chromium, cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, vanadium or zirconium, or any other element to be added to obtain a desired alloying effect, (ii) when the specified minimum for copper does not exceed 0.40 %, or (iii) when the maximum content specified for any of the following elements does not exceed the percentages noted namely (i) manganese – 1.65 %, (ii) silicon –  0.60 %, and (iii) copper – 0.60 %. Carbon steels are normally categorized into the following types. High strength low alloy steels are also known as the micro-alloyed steels. These steels are designed to meet the specific requirement of mechanical properties rather than a chemical composition. These steels are designed to provide better mechanical properties and/or greater resistance to atmospheric corrosion than conventional carbon steels. The carbon content in these steels may range from 0.05 % to 0.25 % and manganese content up to 2.0 % in order to provide adequate deep drawing and welding properties. In these steels, small quantities of chromium, nickel, molybdenum, copper, nitrogen, vanadium, niobium, titanium and zirconium are also used in various combinations. These steels can also have small additions of calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium for sulphide inclusion shape control. Advanced high strength steels have been developed for automotive applications. These automotive grades are different when compared with the conventional low and high strength steels. These steels have superior mechanical properties which are developed in it due to the steel’s structure and due to its distinct processing. Advanced high strength steels are manufactured by adopting control cooling from austenite or austenite plus ferrite phases on the run out roller table in a hot rolling mill or in the cooling section of a continuous annealing furnace in cold rolled product. Some types of these steels are (i) dual phase steel, (ii) transformation induced plasticity steel, (iii) complex phase steel, (iv) martensitic steel, (v) ferritic bainitic steel, (vi) twinning induced plasticity steel, (vii) hot formed steel, and (viii) post forming heat treatable steel. The term ‘Interstitial Free steel’ refers to the fact, that there are no interstitial solute atoms to strain the solid iron lattice, resulting in very soft steel. Interstitial Free steels have interstitial free body centered cubic (bcc) ferrite matrix. These steels normally have low yield strength, high plastic strain ratio, high strain rate sensitivity, and good formability. Interstitial Free steels have ultra-low carbon content, achieved by removing carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other gasses during steelmaking through a vacuum degassing process. Interstitial elements like nitrogen or carbon are also in the form of nitrides and carbides due to the alloying elements such as Nb and/or Ti used for the stabilization of the residual interstitials. Therefore, this steel possesses typically non aging properties. Low alloy steels are steels which show mechanical properties superior to the properties of plain carbon steels due to the additions of alloying elements like nickel, chromium, and molybdenum. Total alloy content in these steels can vary from 2.01 % up to the levels of 8 %. Some people define low alloy steels as those steels which contain alloying elements up to 4 %. In most of the low alloy steels, the primary function of the alloying elements is to increase hardenability so as to optimize the mechanical properties and toughness after heat treatment. However in some cases,  the addition of alloying elements is done to reduce environmental degradation of steels for specified service conditions. High alloy steels have alloying elements in their composition which is more than the low alloy steels. These elements are normally metals. They are intentionally added to incorporate certain properties. There are a large numbers of alloying elements which can be added to steel. Total amount of alloying elements in high alloy steels can vary between 8 % and 50 %. Common alloying elements include manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, silicon, and boron. Less common alloying elements include aluminum, cobalt, copper, cerium, niobium, titanium, tungsten, tin, zinc, lead, antimony and zirconium. Chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten when added to steels improve strength by forming second phase carbides. Manganese, silicon, nickel, and copper are added to increase strength of the steels by forming solid solutions in ferrite. Addition of small quantities of nickel and copper improve corrosion resistance. Molybdenum addition in steel helps to resist embrittlement. Zirconium, cerium, and calcium increase toughness in alloy steels by controlling the shape of inclusions. Manganese sulphide, lead, bismuth, selenium, and tellurium increase machinability. There are several categories of alloy steels. Some of them are (i) constructional alloy steels, (ii) alloy tool and die steels, (iii) high speed steels, (iv) special alloy steels, (v) Marageing steels, (vi) Hadfield manganese steel, and (vii) stainless steels. Stainless steel is a family of alloys of iron that contains at least 10.5% chromium and a maximum of 1.2 % carbon which is essential of ensuring formation of a self-healing surface passive layer. This passive layer provides the corrosion resistance. These steels are valued for high corrosion resistance. They are around 200 times more resistant to corrosion than mild steel. This characteristic makes stainless steels totally different from mild steels. Stainless steels are characterized by corrosion resistance, aesthetic appeal, heat resistance, low life cycle cost, full recyclability, biological neutrality, ease of fabrication, cleanability, and good strength to weight ratio.  The family of stainless steels can be grouped into four types (Fig 1) namely (i) austenitic stainless steels, (ii) martensitic stainless steels, (iii) ferritic stainless steels, and (iv) duplex stainless steels.  Each of these types has specific properties and a basic grade. Austenitic steels are non-magnetic and non-heat treatable. They generally contain 18 % chromium, 8 % nickel and less than 0.8 % carbon. Ferritic stainless steels contain trace amounts of nickel, 12 % to17 % chromium, and less than 0.1 % carbon, along with other alloying elements, such as molybdenum, aluminum or titanium. Ferritic stainless steels are magnetic steels which cannot be hardened with heat treatment, but can be strengthened by cold work. Martensitic stainless steels contain 11 % to 17 % chromium, less than 0.4 % nickel and up to 1.2 % carbon. These steels are magnetic and heat treatable and are used in knives, cutting tools, as well as dental and surgical equipment. Duplex stainless steels belong to the stainless steels family and are characterized by high chromium (19 % to 32 %) and molybdenum (up to 6 %) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels and identified by a dual phase microstructure. They have a well-balanced two phase structure. The two phases in their microstructure consist of grains of ferritic and austenitic stainless steels. Electrical steels are special steels which are tailored to exhibit certain specific magnetic properties such as small hysteresis area (small energy dissipation per cycle or low core loss) and high permeability. It is also called lamination steel, silicon steel, silicon electrical steel or transformer steel. The steel contains specific percentage of silicon in it which is responsible for its unique property. Electrical steels can have from zero to 6.5 % silicon but usually has silicon content up to 3.2 % (higher concentrations usually provoke brittleness during cold rolling). Manganese and aluminum can be added in these steels up to 0.5 %. Silicon significantly increases the electrical resistivity of the steel, which decreases the induced eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus lowering the core loss. Fire resistant steels have higher yield strength at elevated temperatures when compared to carbon steels. Japanese Industrial Standard specifies that the 0.2 % proof stress of fire resistant steels at 600 deg C must retain at least 2/3 of the value at ambient temperature. In other aspects, at ambient temperature, fire resistant steels have the performance and weldability similar to carbon steels. Basically, these steels have similar chemical composition to carbon steel of same strength grade, but have additions of chromium, molybdenum and other alloying elements to improve the yield point at the high temperatures. Free cutting steels also known as free machining steels are those steels which form small chips when machined. Free cutting steels are usually carbon steels which have sulphur, lead, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or phosphorus added to it.  Presence of these elements imparts the properties necessary for free machining since it  basically ensures easy dispersal of chips during machining, thereby reducing the machining force, and improving tool life and surface finish of the machined component. Heat resistant steels are meant for use at temperatures higher than 500 deg C since they have got good strength at this temperature and are particularly resistant to short and long term exposure to hot gases and combustion products at temperature higher than 500 deg C. In heat resistant steels, the two most important elements are chromium for oxidation resistance and nickel for strength and ductility. Generally there are two fundamental classes of heat resistant steels. These are (i) ferritic/martensitic heat resistant steels, and (ii) austenitic heat resistant steels. Spring steels are used for the production of the springs. These steels feature the unique characteristic of being able to withstand considerable twisting or bending forces without any distortion. Products made from these steels can be bent, compressed, extended, or twisted continuously, and they will return to their original shape without suffering any deformation. This characteristic is defined as high yield strength and is due to the result of the specific composition and hardening of the steels. Spring steels are stainless, low alloy, medium or carbon steels manufactured to very high yield strengths. Spring steels are also used when there are special requirements on rigidity or abrasion resistance. Spring steels are to meet the requirements namely (i) high elastic limit, (ii) high ultimate strain, (iii) high contraction at fracture, (iv) good creep rupture strength, (v) good endurance limit, and (vi) low surface decarburization. The above special requirements of spring steels are being met by adding different alloying elements in the steels. These are silicon, manganese, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum and nickel (in case of stainless steels). Most of the spring steels are hardened and tempered to about 45 Rockwell C. Generally springs are made with high carbon spring steels, alloy spring steels and stainless spring steels. Galvanized steels are those steels to which a protective zinc coating is applied to the steel in order to prevent it from rusting. The term is derived from the name of Italian scientist Luigi Galvani. Galvanized steel which are basically coated with zinc include a range of hot dip galvanized and electro-galvanized steel products. Zinc weathers at a very slow rate, so the coating generally has a long life. Zinc has a greater electro-negativity than iron and hence provides cathodic (or sacrificial) protection to the steel. This results in the zinc corroding in preference to the steel if the coating is chipped or damaged to expose the base metal. Besides acting as galvanic protector, the other functions of the zinc layer are (i) to retain the steel intact with its full initial strength, (ii) to provide the surface a more pleasing appearance, (iii) to increase the life of any suitable organic finishing system applied over it, and (iv) to protect the steel from corrosive attack in most atmospheres, acting as a continuous and lasting shield between steel and the atmosphere. Tin free steel is an electrolytic chrome plated steel consisting of a thin layer of chromium and a layer of chromium oxide deposited on a cold rolled steel base (black plate steel) which gives it a beautiful, lustrous metallic finish on both sides. It is also known as electrolytic chromium coated steel. Tin free steel offers outstanding corrosion resistance, lacquer adhesion as well as printability. It is an economical and is high quality replacement for tinplate. It is not suitable for soldering and can only be used for welding after edge cleaning. Electrolytic chromium coated steel is to be lacquered on both surfaces. Tin plate is a thin steel sheet coated by tin. The thin steel sheet on which tin coating is done is known as black plate. Tin has several properties which make it suitable for use as a coating on steel. It has a good resistance to corrosion in a wide range of environments and in particular retains its appearance and surface properties extremely well in indoor atmosphere. It is easily soldered and the good corrosion resistance ensures effective retention of solderability. Thermo mechanical control process steels are those steels which are produced by this process. Thermo mechanical control processing is a microstructural control technique combining controlled rolling (thermo mechanical rolling) and controlled cooling (accelerated cooling). These steels are sometimes micro-alloyed. Thermo mechanical control process is normally used to obtain excellent properties for steel plates such as high strength, excellent toughness along with excellent weldability through maximizing of grain refinement. These steels have almost same formability and weldability compared with mild steels. The superior mechanical properties introduced to the steel through this processing route are virtually equivalent to those obtained by heat treating conventionally rolled or forged steel and hence thermo mechanical control process is used as a substitute for heat treatments that require additional material handling and furnace facilities. The term tool steel is a generic description for those steels which have been developed specifically for tooling applications. These steels are used for making tools, punches and dies etc. Tools used for working steels and other metals must be stronger and harder than the steels or the materials they cut or form. Normally tool steels are known for their distinctive toughness, resistance to abrasion, their ability to hold a cutting edge, and/or their resistance to deformation at elevated temperatures (red hardness). The metallurgical characteristics of various compositions of tool steels are extremely complex. There are hundreds of different types of tool steels available and each may have a specific composition and end use. Tool steels are mainly medium to high carbon steels with specific alloying elements added in different amounts to provide it special characteristics. The carbon in the tool steel is provided to help harden the steel to greater hardness for cutting and wear resistance while alloying elements are added to the tool steel for providing it greater toughness or strength. In some cases, alloying elements are added to retain the size and shape of the tool during its heat treat hardening operation or to make the hardening operation safer and to provide red hardness to it so that the tool retains its hardness and strength when it becomes extremely hot. Various alloying elements in addition to carbon are chromium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, and vanadium. Weathering steels are weather resistant steels which work by controlling the rate at which oxygen in the atmosphere can react with the surface of the steel. These steels are high strength low alloy steels which can provide corrosion protection without additional coating. Increase in alloying elements, mainly copper, provides an arresting mechanism to atmospheric corrosion in the steel itself. The alloying elements in the steel produce a stable and durable rust layer that adheres to the base metal. This rust ‘patina’ develops under conditions of alternate wetting and drying to produce a protective barrier, which impedes further access of oxygen and moisture. This patina acts as a skin to protect the steel substrate. Section loss on the order of 2.5 mm can be expected before the patina sets up, but this is negligible to the structural performance.

what happened on workers day in south africa,"In South Africa, Workers' Day has been celebrated as a national public holiday on 1 May each year since 1994. It has its origins within the historical struggles of workers and their trade unions internationally for solidarity between working people in their struggles to win fair employment standards and more importantly, to establish a culture of human and worker rights and to ensure that these are enshrined in international law and the national law of those countries aligned to the International Labour Organization. In pre-1994 South Africa, the demand for the annual observance of the day as a public holiday became a rallying point for workers and their trade unions and was one of a number of annually significant days to symbolize and mobilize resistance to the Apartheid government and its racial policies.","Sorry, the page you were looking for at this URL was not found. Copyright 2012 AVIS Fleet Services. All Rights Reserved","In pre-1994 South Africa, the demand for the annual observance of Workers’ Day as a public holiday became a rallying point for workers and their trade unions and was one of a number of significant annual days to symbolise and mobilise resistance to the apartheid government and its racial policies. 1 May only became an officially recognised public holiday after the democratic elections of 1994. Workers' Day (May Day) has its origins internationally within the historical struggles of workers and their trade unions for solidarity between working people, in their struggles to win fair employment standards. This included the need to establish a culture of human and worker rights which are enshrined in international law and the national law of those countries aligned to the International Labour Organisation, of which South Africa is a member. In declaring 2011 as a year of job creation through meaningful economic transformation, government aims to address the twin challenges of poverty and unemployment by forging strategic partnerships with key partners, including labour, business and organised sectors of communities. An informed and empowered legion of learners who have the skills to make career decisions is likely to improve the skills profile of the overall population and improve mobility between different levels of education and between education and the labour market. In fulfilling the mandate entrusted by citizens, government remains committed to ensure the welfare and conditions of service for workers. Government has put in place employment protection legislation which has since been passed and implemented and are currently being amended to address dynamics in the labour market. Workers’ Day is also commemorated in the context of dismantling the system of apartheid, which entrenched race-based labour exploitation. Government has instituted other legislation which contributes towards the composite development of South Africans as active participants in our developmental agenda. Government is committed to the realisation of the rights of children as one of the highest priorities for action. This commitment is reflected in Section 27 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa as guided by the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). This commitment is also embraced in national legislation such as the Children’s Act, 2005 (Act  38 of 2005 as amended). To give effect to these national and international obligations, a consolidated children’s rights framework, which serves as a guide on all matters pertaining to children was developed. The Child Protection Week held annually since 1998 under the leadership of the Department of Social Development seeks to educate and mobilise communities to put children first. Government’s comprehensive ECD services invest in the development of children to enable these potential leaders to break the chain of intergenerational poverty. Government, under the leadership of  South African Social Security Agency, is committed to addressing child poverty, through the extension of the social safety net for vulnerable children. It is normal practice in most democracies that during an election period, particular attention is paid to ensuring that government communication structures and officials do not act in a way that advantages or disadvantages participants in the electoral contest. On 31 March 1999, Cabinet decided on a framework to be formulated to regulate against the dissemination of government information during election periods in a way that is to the advantage of one political party and to the disadvantage of others. The guidelines were adopted during the local government elections in 2000 and the national and provincial elections in 2004. However, as outlined in Section 3, it is important to note that the provisions of the Public Service Act, 1994 (Act 103 of 1994), were amended in 2007. They assist government communicators and other relevant public servants in determining the specific parameters within which they should conduct their work during an election period. According to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), an election period is the period during which the IEC's Code of Conduct and the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa’s regulations apply. This period is determined once the date for the election has been announced, party lists are submitted and participating parties and candidates confirmed. The period ends when election results are certified and announced. State-financed media means any newspaper, book, periodical, pamphlet, poster, media release or other printed matter, or statement, or any audio and video material, or any information in electronic format such as CD-ROM, Internet or e-mail, which is produced and disseminated to the public, and which is financed by, and directly under the control of, government. Examples of state-financed media include BuaNewsOnline, internal and external government newsletters and magazines. These regulations apply only to communicators and other relevant public servants. Ministers, deputy ministers, premiers, MECs and all political representatives, contractual workers and employees in role-playing posts in government are regulated by the Ministerial Handbook. Paragraph C.2.7 of the Code of Conduct for the Public Service provides that: “an employee does not abuse her or his position in the Public Service to promote or prejudice the interest of any political party or interest group”. Paragraph C.2.9 provides that “an employee recognises the public’s right of access to information, excluding information that is specifically protected by law”. Employees employed in terms of the Public Service Act, 1994 are permitted to be candidates for elections subject to the Public Service Code of Conduct and the limits prescribed by regulation by the Minister for the Public Service and Administration (Section 36 of the Public Service Act, 1994). If an employee is elected and assumes office, the employee is deemed as having resigned from the Public Service with effect from the date immediately before the date he/she assumes office as a full-time municipal councillor (See Section 36 of the Public Service Act, 1994). An employee elected as a part-time municipal councillor may continue as an employee, but must seek approval in terms of Section 30 of the Public Service Act, 1994 from his/ her executive authority to receive remuneration as councillor (Also see Public Service Regulation Chapter 2 C5. 5). During an election period, these and other provisions of the Act continue to apply to all public servants. Communication agencies and components of government and their employees have to exercise special care to ensure that their media products, statements and public events do not promote or prejudice any political party. Government communicators and their departments should continue meeting the obligation of government to provide information to the people. They should continue exercising their responsibility to articulate, promote and defend the policies, programmes and actions of government. Like all other South Africans, communication officers have freedom of association. Subject to the provisions of the Public Service Amendment Act, 2007 and Public Service Regulations, they may belong to any political party of their choice. The Tourism Indaba 2011 will take place under the theme Playing Globally, Winning Locally between 7 and 10 May 2011 at the Albert Luthuli Convention Centre in Durban. As one of the largest tourism marketing events on the African continent, Indaba 2011 will draw an estimated 13 000 international and local delegates from the tourism sector and related industries. A key focus of Indaba 2011 is the newly launched National Tourism Sector Strategy (NTSS). Government has identified tourism as one of the key contributing sectors to grow the economy and create decent work. Government in partnership with the tourism industry aims to position South Africa as one of the top 20 tourism destinations globally by 2020. South Africa continues to reposition itself as a country of choice following the successful hosting of the 2010 World Cup and numerous other international conferences and sporting events. Tourism players will provide more affordable and accessible tourism experiences for the domestic market, which will include travel packages that accommodate the broader South African population. Transformation of the tourism sector is vital to ensure sustainable growth and development in the tourism industry, and government will work towards increasing the number of tourism programmes and projects which are led by and benefiting communities. President Jacob Zuma will attend the SADC Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government to discuss the regional concerns, including the situations in Madagascar and Zimbabwe. This follows the call from the Troika of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, which met in Zambia on 31 March 2011. The Troika consists of Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa. In a separate but related development, in preparation for the Second Tripartite Summit of the SADC-East African Community-Common Market of East and Southern Africa (SADC-EAC-Comesa) in June 2011 in South Africa, a tripartite ministerial meeting is scheduled from 13 to 14 May in Lusaka, Zambia. SADC remains the most important vehicle to address common concerns in the southern African region. SADC remains seized with political developments in the region and addressing the political and socio-economic challenges facing some of the member states. South Africa contributes to accelerating economic integration of the SADC region and is committed to the promotion of intraregional trade and investment. The Second Tripartite Summit aims to launch the Trilateral (T‑FTA) negotiations and to address the issues of regional infrastructure and the free movement of business persons. South Africa will participate in the second Africa-India Summit at the seat of the African Union (AU) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 20 to 25 May 2011 under the theme Enhancing Partnership: Shared Vision. The summit is expected to highlight progress following the inaugural summit that was held in New Delhi, India, in April 2008. South Africa participates in the summit within the context of strengthening Africa-Asia relations in general and more particularly Africa-India relations in consolidating South-South cooperation. The Africa-India Summit provides a platform for both countries to strengthen their multisectoral partnership to tackle opportunities and challenges. India supports Africa’s developmental agenda through technology and skills transfer, which increases Africa’s competitiveness. Africa is the largest recipient of India’s technical cooperation programme. At the 2008 Summit, India extended several lines of credit to African countries for specific infrastructure development projects. Africa and India, as members of the developing world, share common positions on the reform of global political and economic governance. South Africa is a key player in strengthening Africa’s partnership with India. Heads of state and government, including prominent business leaders from around the continent will gather in Cape Town, for the annual meeting of the WEF Africa from 4 to 6 May 2011.The theme and structure of the meeting will focus on From Vision to Action, Africa’s Next Chapter. Last year, the forum was attended by 13 African heads of state and government and more than 1 000 participants from 85 countries. The WEF Africa provides a platform that fosters interaction among key stakeholders on how to advance Africa’s socio-economic development. The rapid economic growth and deeper integration of African economies into the global system holds the potential of uplifting the state of the world economy. South Africa is committed to advancing the African Agenda and securing greater equity within the international system. There are signs that an economic recovery in South Africa is underway and there is renewed buoyancy in our markets. The 37th G8 Summit will be held from 26 to 27 May 2011 in Deauville, France. The G8 is an informal group of advanced economies – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America – which meets once a year at a summit of heads of state and government. Since 2001, some of the world’s developing countries, including South Africa, have been invited to G8 outreach sessions (G8+5), which are held on the margins of the summit. South Africa participates in the summit to strengthen North-South relations and to advance the African Agenda. The role of the G8 has evolved with the dynamic changing global environment but the initial strategic purpose of the forum remains. South Africa participates in the G8 outreach sessions in its efforts to consolidate the African Agenda. For the G8 to remain relevant and credible in a rapidly changing global environment, it will have to ensure it becomes responsive to the needs and challenges of the developing world. The G8 must focus on the fulfilment of commitments towards the achievement of internationally agreed development goals.

The Western Cape has many dark gems to explore where you’ll see impressive views, experience the Cape’s long history and rock formations that dazzle you as much as they might inspire the occasional bit of trepidation. Here are our picks for epic caves to visit near Cape Town. After a poll of 90,000 readers in the 2017 Telegraph Travel Awards, the South African city of Cape Town was victorious, beating Vancouver and Tokyo to the top prize. Remarkably, it’s the fifth consecutive year that Cape Town has been named number one – and with all eyes on South Africa in 2018, the centenary year of Nelson Mandela’s birth, few would bet against it repeating the trick in 12 months time. Enver Duminy for Cape Town Tourism says the recognition will aid in creating more job opportunities for locals. “These accolades pave the way for even more innovation, entrepreneurship and job creation within the tourism sector.” “They also accurately reflect the variety of experiences Cape Town has to offer visitors, from unparalleled natural beauty, to delicious, intimate culinary adventures in our many restaurants.” Sporty, stylish, stunning, sociable… if Cape Town was a person, it would be that Hollywood starlet we all secretly envy. A coming-together of cultures, cuisines and landscapes, there’s nowhere quite like Cape Town, a singularly beautiful city crowned by the magnificent Table Mountain National Park. So, whether you’re after natural scenery, or interested in indulging in the diverse food scene Cape Town offers, you won’t be let down. Apart from the weak rand, which is making travel to South Africa very appealing to foreigners, Cape Town is only very accessible in terms of accommodation. Cape Town currently has the 21st biggest Airbnb market in the world, and guests can stay in high profile Cape Town suburbs for a fraction of typical area prices – whilst also immersing themselves within local culture. A high percentage of locals are also using Airbnb for staycations within SA’s borders. For hotel stays, SA hotel prices low in comparison to other African hubs. The average rate for a hotel room in Addis Ababa is about R3 212 per night, which is more than double what guests would pay in Cape Town – an average of R1 448 per night, according to a 2015 survey. The rest of the upper end of the ranking has a familiar look. Vancouver has played second fiddle to Cape Town for the last five editions of the awards, while Venice, Sydney and New York are perennial members of the top 10. The City of Cape Town is currently implementing Level 2 Water restrictions. This is due in part to the low dam levels. It is everyone’s responsibility to save water. Motorists whose vehicle licence discs will expire on 31 October 2015 and are renewable by 21 November 2015 will not be receiving renewal notices. The City of Cape Town asks motorists to act proactively to ensure that the necessary arrangements are made and to renew discs online. The National Department of Transport’s (DOT) transfer of the Electronic National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS) to the Road Traffic Management Centre has also affected motorists whose licence discs expired at the end of September 2015 and are renewable by Wednesday 21 October 2015. This transfer has been the reason that motorists have not received notices to renew their annual motor vehicle licences. Take your identity document, complete a green Application for Licencing of Motor Vehicle form (ALV form), and renew your licence at the counter. As a rule, motorists receive a 21-day grace period in which to renew their licence discs from the end of their renewal period. ‘The City apologises for any inconvenience and is doing everything in its power to ease the discomfort of motorists. We ask that the DOT and the Road Traffic Management Centre resolve the transfer of the eNaTIS as soon as possible and that this problem is sorted out before November, which is traditionally the busiest month of the year for motor vehicle disc renewals,’ said the City’s acting Mayoral Committee Member for Finance, Alderman Belinda Walker Tuesday, 11 August 2015, will mark the first day of the City of Cape Town’s long awaited application to the Western Cape High Court for reviewing and setting aside SANRAL’s proposed tolling of portions of the N1 and N2 freeways. Our application could be regarded as the trial of the century as the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the future of our city and the generations who live here for decades to come. The application has been set down for argument over a number of days and is the culmination of a commitment by this government to do whatever it takes to prevent SANRAL from imposing an unjust, unwarranted and devastating tolling decision on our city. It took four years of hard work and court preparation by our staff, our legal team and a team of experts. Since we took the decision to declare an intergovernmental dispute with SANRAL and the National Ministers of Transport and Environmental Affairs, we have witnessed and experienced unprecedented efforts by SANRAL to conceal the truth from a democratically elected government and the people we were elected to serve. SANRAL’s actions were inconsistent with our Constitution and the principles of transparency and collaboration. It required extraordinary efforts on our part, including an application to the Supreme Court of Appeal, to get to the truth of this proposed tolling project, and to be able to share that truth with the residents of Cape Town. SANRAL was determined to withhold facts, such as the real costs of the tolling of the N1 and N2 freeways; the proposed toll fees to be paid by motorists; and the terms of the proposed agreement with the preferred bidder, Protea Parkways Consortium (PPC). The application for secrecy that SANRAL and PPC brought to the court would have had far reaching implications for our rights to access to information and media freedom if we had left it unchallenged. Our fight for access to this information was motivated by the need to fully comprehend the likely impact of tolling the N1 and N2 on our city and our residents so that we could properly challenge the decisions that were made. It was also motivated by our commitment to protect the values of our democracy. We gained access to this information only after we brought another successful application in the High Court to compel SANRAL to provide it to us. Tomorrow we will begin to present our case for a court order that essentially scraps the tolling of the N1 and N2. Our case against SANRAL is complex and contained in court papers that run into thousands of pages of reports and documents. · The SANRAL Board never made the decision to declare the N1 and N2 as toll roads as it was required to do. By implication, we will argue that the decision to toll was made by the CEO of SANRAL who was unauthorised to do so · In 2013 SANRAL was about to enter into a contract with PPC which would have been reckless and irrational. The City obtained an interim order preventing that agreement being signed · One example is the proposed agreement requires SANRAL to reimburse PPC for any loss of revenue caused by the National Minister setting toll tariffs at rates lower than PPC’s tendered rate. PPC’s tender is 84 c/km including VAT. National Government recently capped the e-toll tariffs in Gauteng at 30 c/km including VAT. If motorists in the Western Cape and Gauteng were to be charged the same, then SANRAL would have to pay PPC a conservatively estimated R29 billion – in addition to the tolls which motorists would have to pay to PPC. SANRAL’s contingent liability is more than what it would cost SANRAL to construct the upgrades proposed by PPC and to continue maintaining and operating the N1 and N2 freeways as it currently does. SANRAL and the National Government never considered this massive risk and were unaware of it until the City discovered it when analysing the documents which SANRAL tried to keep secret I cannot predict the outcome of the arguments that will ensue in the days ahead, but I remain reasonably confident and optimistic. The fight to prevent urban tolling will not end with this hearing, nor with this case. It will take all of us who are opposed to the inequity of this scheme to stand together, to voice our objections, and to fight to prevent it. I am of the firm view that the proposed Winelands Toll Scheme is as irrational, reckless and dangerous to our future as the Gauteng e-tolls scheme was and is. The people of Gauteng took a firm stand against the scheme that was imposed on them. I am calling on the people of Cape Town to do the same. The City of Cape Town’s Water and Sanitation Department has launched a new and improved website, loaded with useful information that may assist residents, learners, students, educators and visitors. The City is confident that the use of interactive diagrams, video clips, posters and brochures to present information in a more user-friendly way will significantly improve the experience of those visiting the Water and Sanitation Department’s new website, making it easier to access information and to interpret it. ‘For instance, by visiting http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Water residents will be able to access a detailed explanation about water tariffs and how we bill them for water usage, and how to apply for a water management device, or to be connected to the City’s water system. Selling your house? We list a few things to consider and we provide a brochure for new homeowners as well,’ says the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Utility Services, Councillor Ernest Sonnenberg. Today is Workers’ Day in South Africa – a public holiday that has its origins internationally, within the historical struggles of workers and their trade unions. The day celebrates the rights of workers, and recognises their struggle for fair working conditions and employment standards. It has been a holiday since 1994, and has ties to the International Workers’ Day celebrations enjoyed in many other countries. In pre-1994 South Africa, the demand for the annual observance of the day as a public holiday became a rallying point for workers and their trade unions, and was one of a number of significant dates to symbolise and mobilise resistance to the apartheid government and its racial policies. While it is still an important day for workers in particular, it’s a chance for all South Africans to have a day to themselves, and for those who do work, to enjoy a well-deserved break.

what is the difference between duplex and doppler ultrasound,"Doppler ultrasonography is medical ultrasonography that employs the Doppler effect to generate imaging of the movement of tissues and body fluids (usually blood), and their relative velocity to the probe. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualized. Color Doppler or color flow Doppler is the presentation of the velocity by color scale. Color Doppler images are generally combined with grayscale (B-mode) images to display duplex ultrasonography images, allowing for simultaneous visualization of the anatomy of the area.",Watching a lot of medical equipment news and learning some knowledges of medical equipment. All the hardworking just to be a profesional medical equipments supplier and service better for you. We hope the information about medical we provide could helps you to choose your suitable products.,"The Doppler Sonography (Scientech 13E) is used to measure the blood flow with the doppler ultrasound. A realistic arm model is used to show the differences between continuously (venous) and (arterial) flow and between normal blood flow and a stenosis. Doppler Sonography uses the doppler effect to assess whether structures (usually blood) are moving towards or away from the ultrasonic probe,and its relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a paticular sample volume, for example a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, speed and direction of sample volume can be determined and visualised. Doppler frequency shift is the difference in ultrasound frequency between transmitted and received echoes, the echoes frequency minus the transmitted frequency. The doppler frequency is proportional to the blood flow velocity. Doppler sonography is used for cardiovascular study (sonography of the vasculature system and heart) and reverse blood flow in the liver. The pump is switched on and the speed is adjusted in a middle range (ca. 4000 min -1). The mode is GK (continuously, venous). With the doppler probe and coupling gel the arm model is scanned for a vessel with a significant audio signal. The flow in the spectral image is analysed for negative and positive components . The probe direction is then switch by 180º. Then the vessel is scanned for changes in the spectral image and the differences between the image of healthy vessel and the stenosis will be characterised.The pump is switched to P1 and P2 Mode (pulsatil ) the image are analysed and pulse rate is determine.

As the term means, CDMA is a type of multiplexing, which enables several signals to occupy a single communication channel, optimizing the use of existing bandwidth. This technology is used in ultra-high-frequency (UHF) cellular telephone structures in the 800-MHz and 1.9-GHz bands. Currently, there are many CDMA jobs available in top-most organizations. To know more about updates and expected interview questions  about the related skill please visit CDMA job interview questions and answers page framed by wisdomjobs, professional experts. Question 1. What Is Cdma? Answer :CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access. It is a wireless technology used in transmission of signals from places with high Security and noise reduction. The principle of Spread Spectrum is used to work with CDMA. Spread signal is below the noise level and noise has no effect on the signal. CDMA is not a frequency specific to each user, instead, every channel uses the full available spectrum. Individual conversations are encoded with a pseudo-random digital sequence. A unique code is received by all mobile network users and is allowed continuous network access instead of intermittent or timed access. CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access.

Reverse traffic channels are used by individual users in their actual calls to transmit traffic from a single mobile station to one or more base stations. Question 13. Explain The Cdma Capacity? Capacity in CDMA is soft, CDMA has all users on each frequency and users are separated by code. This means, CDMA operates in the presence of noise and interference. In addition, neighboring cells use the same frequencies, which means no re-use. So, CDMA capacity calculations should be very simple. No code channels in a cell, multiplied by no cells. But it is not that simple. Although not available code channels are 64, it may not be possible to use a single time, since the CDMA frequency is the same. Flexible capability means that all the code channels can be pursued at a time, but at the expense of quality. Question 14. Describe The Centralized Methods In Cdma? 1.25 MHz of FDMA channel is divided into 64 code channels. Question 15. Explain Processing Gain In Cdma? The Voice Activity Factor of 0.4 is considered = -4dB. CDMA has 100% frequency reuse. Use of same frequency in surrounding cells causes some additional interference. In CDMA, frequency reuse efficiency is 0.67 (70% eff.) = -1.73dB Question 16. What Are The Cdma Identities? Question 17. What Is Permuted Esn? Answer :CDMA is a spread spectrum technique where multiple users to access the system at the same example in a cell, and of course on the same frequency. Therefore, discriminate the users on the reverse link (i.e. information from MS to the base station). It spreads information using codes that are unique to the mobile station in all the CDMA cellular systems. This code has an element that is the ESN. But it doesn’t use the ESN in the same format; instead, it uses an ESN swapped.

The frequency band is divided into channels of equal bandwidth so that each conversation is carried on a different frequency. Guard bands are used between the adjacent signal spectra to minimize crosstalk between the channels. Question 22. What Are The Advantages Of Fdma? Answer :In FDMA when the channel is not used, it is the channel bandwidth while rest simply is relatively narrow (30 KHz), known as System narrowband. Little or no equalization is needed. For broadcasting, time symbols are suitable analogue links. Framing for FDMA or synchronization bits are not needed for the tight filter streaming. It is required to minimize the combined interference of FDD.

What Are The Advantages Of Tdma? Question 26. What Are The Disadvantages Of Tdma? Question 27. What Is Cdma? Explain. Answer :Code Division Multiple Access system is very different from time and frequency multiplexing. In this system, a user has access to the whole bandwidth for the entire duration. The basic principle is that different CDMA codes are used to distinguish between different users. Forms generally used are direct sequence spread spectrum modulation (DS-CDMA), frequency hopping or mixed CDMA detection (JD CDMA). Here, a signal is generated which extends over a wide bandwidth. A code called spreading code is used to perform this action. Using a group of codes, which are orthogonal to each other, it is possible to select a signal with a given code in the presence of many other signals with different orthogonal codes.

What Are The Advantages Of Cdma? Question 29. What Are The Disadvantages Of Code Division Multiple Access? Question 30. What Is Spread Spectrum Technique? Answer :Spread spectrum is a form of wireless communications in which the frequency of the transmitted signal is deliberately varied. This results in a much greater bandwidth than the signal would have, if its frequency were not varied. In other words, the transmitted signal bandwidth is greater than the minimal information bandwidth needed to successfully transmit the signal. Some function other than the information itself is being employed to determine the resultant transmitted bandwidth.

The precise order in which the break occurs is determined by a hopping table generated by using a pseudo-random code sequence. Question 33. What Are The Advantages Of Spread Spectrum? Question 34. What Is Pn Sequence In Cdma? Answer :The DS-CDMA system uses two types of spreading sequences − PN sequences and orthogonal codes. The PN sequence is generated by the pseudo-random noise generator which is simply a binary linear feedback shift register, consisting of XOR gates and a shift register. This PN generator has the ability to create a sequence identical for both the transmitter and the receiver, and while retaining the desirable properties of the noise randomness bit sequence.

Answer :Walsh Codes are most commonly used in CDMA applications orthogonal codes. These codes correspond to lines of a special square matrix called the Hadamard matrix. For a set of Walsh codes of length N, it consists of n lines to form a square matrix of n × n Walsh code. The IS-95 system uses 64 Walsh function matrix 64. The first line of this matrix contains a string of all zeros with each of the following lines containing different combinations of bit 0 and 1. Each line is orthogonal and equal representation for binary bits. When implemented with the CDMA system, each mobile user uses one of the 64 sequences of rows in the matrix as a spreading code, providing zero cross-correlation among all the other users.

Question 38. What Is Soft Handover/handoff? Cellular system tracks mobile stations in order to maintain their communication links. The mobile station goes to neighbor cell and communication link switches from current cell to the neighbor cell which is called as soft handover. Question 39. What Is Hard Handover? Answer :In FDMA or TDMA cellular system, new communication establishes after breaking current communication at the moment doing handoff. Communication between MS and BS breaks at the moment switching frequency or timeslot which is known as hard handover.

Communication between MS and BS breaks at the moment switching frequency or timeslot which is known as hard handover. Question 40. What Is Power Control? Answer :Power control is the intelligent selection of transmit power in a communication system for achieving best performance within the system. The performance depends on context and there are chances to include optimizing metrics like link data rate, network capacity, geographic coverage, and range. A higher transmit power translates into a higher signal power at the receiver.

A higher transmit power translates into a higher signal power at the receiver. Question 41. What Is Reverse Link Power Control? Answer :The power of closed loop control is used to compensate for the rapid Rayleigh discoloration. This time, the mobile transmitted power is controlled by the base station. For this purpose, the base station continuously monitors the reverse link signal quality. If the quality of the connection is poor then the base station increases the power. Similarly, if the quality of the link is very high then the mobile base station controller reduces the power. This is called as reverse link power control.

Similarly, if the quality of the link is very high then the mobile base station controller reduces the power. This is called as reverse link power control. Question 42. What Is Forward Link Power Control? Answer :Similar to reverse link power control, forward link power control is also necessary to maintain the forward link quality to a specified level. This time, the mobile monitors the forward link quality and indicates to the base station to turn on or off, this power control has no effect on the near-far problem because all the signals are blurred together the same level of power when they get to the mobile. In short, there is no near-far problem in the forward link.

In short, there is no near-far problem in the forward link. Question 43. Explain The Effects Of Power Control? Question 44. Explain The Frequency Allocation Concept? CDMA system is against this, since all users share the same frequency, the arrangement of the frequency is not an issue. This is in designing the system, which will be a very big advantage. Question 45. What Are The Interferences In Cdma? Question 46. Explain The Cmda Interference “frame Error Rate.”? Answer :The number of transmission errors, measured in terms of a frame error rate (FER). It increases with the number of calls. To overcome this problem, the minicell and mobile site can increase the power until either the mobile or the minicell site can power up more further to reduce FER to an acceptable amount. This event provides a soft limit calls from a particular minicell. The number of transmission errors, measured in terms of a frame error rate (FER). It increases with the number of calls.

The main thing in the security is the encryption of the data. Encryption is a process of obscuring information to make it unreadable. In simple words, it is the translation of data into a secret code. The most effective way to achieve data security is Encryption. One cannot gain access to an encrypted file without the secret key or password. Password decrypts the encrypted document. Encryption converts the data into a form called cipher text, which cannot be understood by unauthorized people. The stronger the cipher the harder it is for the unauthorized people to break it. Cost is the main factor for the strength of encryption. Here are some ways through which one can ensure that the data is encrypted and the wireless network is safe; All wireless computers are radio transmitters and receivers which anyone can listen in. To make sure that the information remains private, the solution is to encrypt the data so that a limited access is achieved. Only people with the password can transmit and can read the data. One can have the security control of the network through the QPA. But for many of the public Wi-Fi, one might not be able to give the same statement. WPA2 was the final certified version of WPA which came out in 2004. It introduced Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP). Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an encryption methodology. By using this system one can set up different levels of encryption key strength, either 40-bit key or 104-bit key. In the year 2001 many WEP cryptographic vulnerabilities were identified. One of them is that WEP used static keys, the keys never changed. All the people were using the same keys and the keys were static. This made it easy to crack into any WEP connection in just a few minutes. So it was recommended not to use WEP. When the encryption vulnerability was found out then Wi-Fi protected access was introduced. It was referred to WPA, WPA2 and WPA2-Enterprise. Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). It is a common set of frameworks that can be used to authenticate people onto wireless networks. It provides many different ways to authenticate based on RFC standards. WPA and WPA2 use five EAP types such as authentication mechanisms PEAP stands for Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol. It is created by Cisco, Microsoft and RSA Security. To come up with a way to encrypt all of these communications that is very much a standard network across mini wireless devises what this essentially does is create a TLS tunnel, one certificate on the server. And the entire authentication is encrypted in that tunnel. A common way of setting up the authentication methods especially early on wireless networks was created as a proprietary method by Cisco it is called Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP). LEAP uses passwords only; no detailed certificate management is required. It is based on MS-CHAP (including MS-CHAP security shortcomings). MAC stands for Media Access Control, it is the hardware address. It limits access through the physical hardware by keeping the neighbours out and by maintaining an additional administration with visitors. It is easy to find working MAC addresses through wireless LAN analysis. MAC addresses can be spoofed and it's free open-source software. In reality it provides a security through obscurity. SSID stands for Service set identifier. To ensure safety one must change the SSID to something not-so obvious. One might also be able to disable the SSID broadcasting from the configuration settings of the access point by turning the broadcast on or off. SSID is easily determined through wireless network analysis. Applying this provides security through obscurity. When WPA came out it used TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol). TKIP provides the rotation of keys. This was an improvement over WEP primarily because TKIP allowed changing the keys in every packet. And the rotation made it very difficult to decrypt the data. The mechanism which is used in the TKIP is almost same as the WEP. Hence the one, who is using such network, is prone to get attacked by the similar attacks. The CCMP is the encryption protocol which has been designed especially for the WLAN products. They can help implementing the standards of the IEE 802. It is the enhanced data encryption mechanism which is designed for the confidentiality of the data and it also meets the AES standards, With the help of this, one can get ensured that ne would be able to maintain the data encryption and the data would stay safe and in the confidentiality. Also, the protocol ensures that only the authorized parties, which are authorized by one, can get access to the information. Also, one can get some authentication and the proof of the genuineness and the last but not the least, one can also benefit the other perks like the layer management conjunction. Also, one can be very comfortable using this since the CCMP is has a block chipper mode. It uses the 128 key and hence it can secure some attacks against the operation. Where one might put the antenna can make a huge difference on the security level. The access points can be layered and overlapped a little bit so that frequencies don't create any problem. One might adjust the power levels or use different types of antennas. The best thing about the antenna is that we can know that we should be putting the router closer to get some full access. Like, if one has router located at the ground floor and he is working at the upper floor, then one should put the antenna at some place where he can get maximum signals. Another thing that he can do is, to install new router there. Normally, the antennas that one has have some limited range, are not being used these days. But they can be very helpful for one. Like, if one wants to get the signals become limited then it is a great tool to apply at home. One should set the power level to as low as they can in a wireless configuration. In this way the control of the signal level can be achieved. Some additional study is required to know the exact amount of power that should be set. The power control is actually said to be the intelligent selection of some power output of a transmitter it helps the communication system get some good performance there in the system. One should know that the good performance can actually depends on the optimizing metrics and the context as well. This is the technique which forces the HTTP client who is on a network, to see some special webpage before he starts using the internet in a normal way. Hence, it helps turning the web browser in the authentication device. One can get it done by some interception the packets, not caring about the ports or the addresses. At such time, the browser becomes directed towards a web page which can have some authentication required or the payment as well. So when someone open up the browser and finds out a message that he hasn't paid the previous bills and he needs to do that in order to keep enjoying the services, then the network provider has dome it through the usage of the technique mentioned. Also, the web browser can also be directed towards some page which can require the authentication. One can find these captive portals are several places which can include the wireless routers at home, offices, hotels rooms, some business centres and the jacks for open Ethernet as well. The thing is that the login page ah to be presented to the client itself. That login page has to be stored in the gateway locally, or in the hosting of webserver. There the page has to be listed through some walled gardened so it can get bypassed the given authentication process. It also depends on the set features of the gateway. The signal might also depend on the receiver. High gain antennas can hear a lot. It also depends hugely on the location, where the connection is used. The antennas are of any types and one can find them in the market. They can be the yogi type, the ones which were used decades ago for the TV signals receiving. The antenna can be the dipoles and the monopole as well and one should know about them all in order to develop some better understanding of how this antenna system works and how it can help someone get and send some really good signals. the site survey, which is the wireless survey, is also known as the RF site or the wireless survey. Is basically a process which includes the planning and the design of the wireless network? It helps one getting some wireless solution which can deliver the demanded wireless coverage's, network capacities and the roaming abilities. This survey also includes some site visits to the testing d RF and to have some ability to get the optimum install locations for the access point. Also, it requires some analysis of the building of facility inception, floor plans, and the survey site tools. One should also know that it includes the interviews done with the IT management and with the end users too to help understand that what are demanded design parameters which related to the wireless network. One should also know that when the wireless site survey is done, some of the effective boundary is set up as well. It helps ne defining the area upon which the signals levels would support the applications intended. Also, it would be involving the minimum of the signals and noise ratio. Also, the survey can also include some auditing, diagnosing, walk testing etc. One should also know about the process of the wireless sites. They are done with the help of some computer software's which helps collecting the data and analysing the metrics of the WLAN and the spectrum characteristics. Before the survey is conducted, some site map of first imported to the survey site application and then is calibrated to the scale. Also, during one survey, the person taking that survey walks into the facility and keeps a portable computer with him which can help recording the data continuously. Also, then he marks the position he currently holds on the map manually, and then clicks at the floor plan and sues the GPS receiver that also marks the position automatically. This helps a lot if the survey is being conducted outdoors. After this survey is done, then the analysis of this data is performed. The results which are gained by the survey are then documented in some reports of the survey which is generated through the application. It is basically the part of some comprehensive network access which includes the authentication support and the authorization services. One can find two main strategies which can help someone secure the connection between the private networks and then can enable the access for the remote users as well. The systems and methods listed above only provide a security through obscurity. They have marked changes in securing the wireless network but many changes are yet to come, which may provide one with the high level security that one wishes to achieve. Hackers are everywhere and one must be careful with their valuable data. So basically, one should know what parameters are available out there, which can help someone improve the security of the wireless network.  Also, one can know which steps should be taken in order to improve the performance and the signals range. The encryption types, specially can lead someone have the security of the data and the power settings can ensure some really good performance is the devices which are used by one.

The song was thought to be sung by Jamaican banana workers, with a repeated melody and refrain (call and response); to each set lyric, the workers made a response. There were numerous versions of lyrics, some likely improvised on the spot by the singers. The song was probably created around the second half of the nineteenth century or the first half of twentieth century, where there was a rise of the banana trade in Jamaica. The song was first recorded by Trinidadian singer Edric Connor and his band ""Edric Connor and the Caribbeans"" on the 1952 album Songs From Jamaica; the song was called ""Day Dah Light"". Belafonte based his version on Connor's 1952 and Louise Bennett's 1954 recordings.

Saujani was a Yale graduate finance attorney who in 2010 suspended her finance career to become the first Indian-American woman to run for Congress. She lost that race (by what she calls a humiliating margin), but while campaigning, she had noticed that the computer classes in the New York City schools she visited were comprised of mostly all boys. That struck a nerve, and she started Girls Who Code, an organization dedicated to ending the gender disparity in computer science, and increasing the opportunities available to girls from minority backgrounds or low-income homes. While Girls Who Code was picking up momentum, Saujani had a second political loss in 2013 for public advocate, which was the impetus for the organization to really skyrocket. She had become skilled at raising money while campaigning, so she now used those skills to secure classroom space and funding for Girls Who Code from major brands like Google and Twitter. Girls Who Code now has 90,000 students and alumni from all fifty states that have been introduced to computer science and given a nurturing environment. Even more important than the education and tools, these girls were given permission to fail. Away from the mostly male hyper competitive coding culture, students realized that failing was part of getting better. And that approach is working: the program’s alumni are becoming computer science majors at 15 times the national average rate. Reshma Saujani said of starting Girls Who Code, “My whole life, all I wanted was to give back. And in losing that campaign, it opened my eyes up to the different ways you actually can make an impact.” Embracing failure isn’t just important for innovative start-ups and creatives, it’s key to keeping giant corporations from becoming static and stale. A leader of such a massive company that embraces failure is CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. While Amazon has obviously experienced great success, there have also been plenty of very expensive failures. Amazon Destinations (a booking site), their smartphone, the Fire Phone are both duds that cost the company millions. And while Bezos compared those failures to a root canal without anesthesia, it’s understood that these types of missteps are critical to the overall success of the company. Another costly failure was a site for auctions, named Amazon Auctions. The site didn’t pan out, and then evolved into an effort called zShops, which also failed. Eventually, the auction idea evolved into Amazon Marketplace, an e-commerce platform owned and operated by Amazon that allows third-party sellers to sell new or used products alongside Amazon's regular products. Marketplace sales now represent around 30% of Amazon’s sales. As Bezos said, ""To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there."" And that’s the real key in our eyes; invention and innovation are critical to all kinds of amazing growth, but you can’t get there if you don’t try. And no business or person is capable of really trying to innovate without failing sometimes. Of course we all try not to fail, but when it does happen, we do a disservice to ourselves to not acknowledge and study it, to use what we’ve learned and do something even bigger and better than we did before. As Henry Ford (who had a slight bit of success in life) said, “failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.” Here’s to a more intelligent 2019! © 2023 Beach Lion Studios.

q1 what is dss (decision support system) explain different types of dss,"A decision support system (DSS) is an information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance -- i.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.","A decision support system (DSS) is a computer-based information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities. DSSs serve the management, operations, and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance - i.e. Unstructured and Semi-Structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized, human-powered or a combination of both. While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support decision making process, DSS is also a tool to facilitate organizational processes. DSSs include knowledge-based systems. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions. DSSs are often contrasted with more automated decision-making systems known as Decision Management Systems. There are possibilities and examples of building a DSS in any knowledge domain. For example, DSS is extensively used in business and management. Executive dashboards and other business performance software allow faster decision making, identification of negative trends, and better allocation of business resources. Through a DSS, all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decisions. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems.

While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support decision making processes, DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes.  Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any system that might support decision making and some DSS include a decision-making software component; Sprague (1980)[1] defines a properly termed DSS as follows: Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by D. Power:  he differentiates communication-driven DSS, data-driven DSS, document-driven DSS, knowledge-driven DSS, and model-driven DSS.[2] *A communication-driven DSS enables cooperation, supporting more than one person working on a shared task; examples include integrated tools like Google Docs or Microsoft SharePoint Workspace.  *A data-driven DSS (or data-oriented DSS) emphasizes access to and manipulation of a time series of internal company data and, sometimes, external data. *A document-driven DSS manages, retrieves, and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats. *A knowledge-driven DSS provides specialized problem-solving expertise stored as facts, rules, procedures or in similar structures like interactive decision trees and flowcharts.[2] … Although computerized decision support systems are being used in many areas of medicine and have demonstrated improved patient outcomes, their use in psychiatric illness is limited.  The authors designed and developed a computerized decision support system for the treatment of major depressive disorder by using evidence-based guidelines, transferring the knowledge gained from the Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP).  This computerized decision support system (CompTMAP) provides support in diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and preventive care and can be incorporated into the clinical setting.",,,,,,,,
