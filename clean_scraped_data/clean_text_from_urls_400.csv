what is the money supply of the us,"As of April 2013, the monetary base was $3 trillion and M2, the broadest measure of money supply, was $10.5 trillion.","Parents probably dream of sending their kid to the University of Chicago.   Next to the Ivy League or Stanford, the Chicago school is near the top of the   heap. Only 27 percent of applicants are admitted. To be among the roughly 15,000   means prestige and an education to build a lifetime on. The cost for tuition and   fees: $39,381. Room and board is another $12,000 or so. Add books and other   stuff, and the total Chicago-school experience costs $54,290 a year. Students learn from the likes of University of Chicago economics professor   Casey B. Mulligan, who believes what the economy needs right now is a little   inflation in all the right places to make things better. Professor Mulligan writes for the ""Economix"" section of the New York Times, which goes   about the task of ""Explaining the Science of Everyday Life."" Mulligan writes that normally inflation is harmful, but ""these days inflation   may do less harm than good."" He points out that the prices of most goods march   upward over time and that this ""general increase in consumer prices is called   inflation."" Of course that's not true. The increase in prices is the   result of inflation, which is the increasing of the supply of money: thus   the term ""inflating"" the money supply. The Chicago economist then writes that the Federal Reserve is charged with   limiting inflation, ""which it can do over the long run by limiting the supply of   money and similar assets in the hands of the public."" In the long run, the Federal Reserve has decimated a dollar's value down to 2   cents in the just short of a century it has been around. In August of 1971, M2   money supply was $685 billion, in March 2011, M2 was $8.9 trillion. Mulligan writes that people complain about rising prices, but forget that   their wages are going up at the same time, so consumer purchasing power is   unharmed. Inflation-adjusted wages have been flat to negative. It has taken two   incomes to pay for a household for decades now. Perhaps Mulligan should get out   more. Seniors should quit bitching, according to Mulligan because, ""Social Security   benefits automatically increase with wages in the economy, and thereby   automatically increase with inflation in the long run."" However, according to Social   Security Online, ""Under existing law, there can be no COLA   [cost-of-living adjustment] in 2011."" Why? As determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is no increase in the   CPI-W [Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers] from   the third quarter of 2008, the last year a COLA was determined, to the third   quarter of 2010. So the government says there is no price inflation and so no COLA for you,   retirees. Retirees know better and so does John Williams at Shadowstats,   who says prices are increasing at a 10 percent rate. Government spending leads to government borrowing, which leads to inflation   when central banks create money out of nowhere to fund that debt. However, the   Chicago economist claims his work shows that inflation is not associated with   increased government spending. Rightly, Mulligan points out that taxes crimp saving and investment. But for   his big finish, Mulligan claims that since so many people are underwater on   their mortgages and because this is hampering economic growth, ""an inflation   that harmed banks and helped homeowners might be an overall improvement."" One gets the impression that in Mulligan's ivory-tower world, Ben Bernanke   creates money like Picasso painted a picture. After careful contemplation,   staring at the canvass (economy), Ben dabs his brush into his palette, and then,   calmly and carefully, applies the proper color and amount of paint (money), a   gentle stroke, in just the right spot. F.A. Hayek, who joined the Committee on Social Thought at the University of   Chicago in 1950, believed that money printing could not be used to assure total   employment or to pump up the prices of desired assets whether they be houses or   something else. It was impossible for central bankers to know where the money   would go or what the exact effects would be. In the study of such complex phenomena as the market, which depend on the   actions of many individuals, all the circumstances which will determine the   outcome of a process … will hardly ever be fully known or   measurable. So while Mulligan sees Bernanke with a fine-tipped artist's brush, the Fed is   actually using a spray gun with an unknowable fan size. The money goes some   places and not others. There are bubbles in art prices, while tract-home prices sink. Catfish prices   are jumping, but television   prices are sinking. Peter Klein wrote that while at   Chicago Hayek found himself among a dazzling group, with an economics department   led by Frank Knight, Milton Friedman, and later George Stigler. Back in 1950, having Hayek and Knight teach your kid economics would have   been worth the price. But $50,000 for Professor Mulligan's theories?

the effect of more relative humidity on human health is,"Humans are sensitive to high humidity because the human body uses evaporative cooling, enabled by perspiration, as the primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Perspiration evaporates from the skin more slowly under humid conditions than under arid. Because humans perceive a low rate of heat transfer from the body to be equivalent to a higher air temperature, the body experiences greater distress of waste heat burden at high humidity than at lower humidity, given equal temperatures.","Humidity  is the amount of water vapor in the air. Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible.[1] Humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog.  Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin.  This effect is calculated in a heat index table or humidex. The amount of water vapor that is needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large, for example; A parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 30 °C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 8 °C There are three main measurements of humidity: absolute, relative and specific. Absolute humidity is the water content of air at a given temperature expressed in gram per cubic meter.[2] Relative humidity, expressed as a percent, measures the current absolute humidity relative to the maximum (highest point) for that temperature. Specific humidity is a ratio of the water vapor content of the mixture to the total air content on a mass basis. Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor present in a given volume of air. It does not take temperature into consideration. Absolute humidity in the atmosphere ranges from near zero to roughly 30 grams per cubic meter when the air is saturated at 30 °C.[4] The absolute humidity changes as air temperature or pressure changes.  This makes it unsuitable for chemical engineering calculations, e.g. for clothes dryers, where temperature can vary considerably.  As a result, absolute humidity in chemical engineering may refer to mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the mass mixing ratio (see ""specific humidity"" below), which is better suited for heat and mass balance calculations.  Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above is also defined as volumetric humidity.  Because of the potential confusion, British Standard BS 1339 (revised 2002) suggests avoiding the term ""absolute humidity"".  Units should always be carefully checked.  Many humidity charts are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used. The field concerned with the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas–vapor mixtures is named psychrometrics. Relative humidity is normally expressed as a percentage; a higher percentage means that the air-water mixture is more humid. Relative humidity is an important metric used in weather forecasts and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog.  In hot summer weather, a rise in relative humidity increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin. For example, according to the Heat Index, a relative humidity of 75% at air temperature of 80.0 °F (26.7 °C) would feel like 83.6 °F ±1.3 °F (28.7 °C ±0.7 °C). [8][9] Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of water vapor mass () to the air parcel's total (i.e., including dry) mass () and is sometimes referred to as the humidity ratio.[10]  Specific humidity is approximately equal to the ""mixing ratio"", which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel.[10] As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large, for example; A parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at −1 °C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at −12 °C. However, specific humidity is also defined as the ratio of water vapor to the total mass of the system (dry air plus water vapor).[11] For example, the ASHRAE 2009 Handbook, Ch1,1.2, (9a) defines specific humidity as ""the ratio of the mass of water vapor to total mass of the moist air sample"". There are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity. A device used to measure humidity is called a psychrometer or hygrometer. A humidistat is a humidity-triggered switch, often used to control a dehumidifier. Humidity is also measured on a global scale using remotely placed satellites. These satellites are able to detect the concentration of water in the troposphere at altitudes between 4 and 12 kilometers. Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to infrared radiation. Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band. Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions (like the formation of thunderstorms) and in the development of weather forecasts. While humidity itself is a climate variable, it also interacts strongly with other climate variables. The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall. At the same time, humidity affects the energy budget and thereby influences temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor in the atmosphere contains ""latent"" energy. During transpiration or evaporation, this latent heat is removed from surface liquid, cooling the earth's surface. This is the biggest non-radiative cooling effect at the surface. It compensates for roughly 70% of the average net radiative warming at the surface. Second, water vapor is the most abundant of all greenhouse gases. Water vapor, like a green lens that allows green light to pass through it but absorbs red light, is a ""selective absorber"". Along with other greenhouse gases, water vapor is transparent to most solar energy, as you can literally see. But it absorbs the infrared energy emitted (radiated) upward by the earth's surface, which is the reason that humid areas experience very little nocturnal cooling but dry desert regions cool considerably at night. This selective absorption causes the greenhouse effect. It raises the surface temperature substantially above its theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature with the sun, and water vapor is the cause of more of this warming than any other greenhouse gas. Unlike most other greenhouse gases, however, water is not merely below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but below its freezing point at many altitudes.  As a condensible greenhouse gas, it precipitates, with a much lower scale height and shorter atmospheric lifetime- weeks instead of decades.  Without other greenhouse gases, Earth's blackbody temperature, below the freezing point of water, would cause water vapor to be removed from the atmosphere.[12][13][14]  Water vapor is thus a ""slave"" to the non-condensible greenhouse gases.[15][16][17] The most humid cities on earth are generally located closer to the equator, near coastal regions. Cities in South and Southeast Asia are among the most humid. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Singapore have very high humidity all year round because of their proximity to water bodies and the equator and often overcast weather. Some places experience extreme humidity during their rainy seasons combined with warmth giving the feel of a lukewarm sauna, such as Kolkata, Chennai and Cochin in India, and Lahore in Pakistan. Sukkur city located on the Indus River in Pakistan has some of the highest and most uncomfortable dew point in the country frequently exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) in the Monsoon season.[18] High temperatures couple up with bizarre dew point to create heat index in excess of 65 °C (149 °F). Darwin, Australia experiences an extremely humid wet season from December to April. Shanghai and Hong Kong in China also have an extreme humid period in their summer months. During the South-west and North-east Monsoon seasons (respectively, late May to September and November to March), expect heavy rains and a relatively high humidity post-rainfall. Outside the monsoon seasons, humidity is high (in comparison to countries North of the Equator), but completely sunny days abound. In cooler places such as Northern Tasmania, Australia, high humidity is experienced all year due to the ocean between mainland Australia and Tasmania. In the summer the hot dry air is absorbed by this ocean and the temperature rarely climbs above 35 °C (95 °F). In the United States the most humid cities, strictly in terms of relative humidity, are Forks and Olympia, Washington.[19] This fact may come as a surprise to many, as the climate in this region rarely exhibits the discomfort usually associated with high humidity. This is because high dew points play a more significant role than relative humidity in discomfort, and so the air in these western cities usually does not feel ""humid"" as a result. In general, dew points are much lower in the Western U.S. than those in the Eastern U.S. The highest dew points in the US are found in coastal Florida and Texas. When comparing Key West and Houston, two of the most humid cities from those states, coastal Florida seems to have the higher dew points on average. However, Houston lacks the coastal breeze present in Key West, and, as a much larger city, it suffers from the urban heat island effect.[20]  A dew point of 88 °F (31 °C) was recorded in Moorhead Minnesota on July 19, 2011, with a heat index of 133.5, although dew points over 80 °F (27 °C) are rare there.[21] The US city with the lowest annual humidity is Las Vegas, Nevada, averaging 39% for a high and 21% as a low.[22]  Appleton, Wisconsin registered a dew point of 90 degrees F on 13 July 1995 with an air temperature of 104 degrees resulting in a heat index of 149 degrees; this record has apparently held and in fact the highest dew point measured in the country bounced amongst or was tied by locations in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa during the preceding 70 years or more with locations in northern Illinois also coming close.  Dew points of 95 degrees are found on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at certain times. Humidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the ideal gas law. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the humidity content. This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity). Humid air is less dense than dry air because a molecule of water (M ≈ 18 u) is less massive than either a molecule of nitrogen (M ≈ 28) or a molecule of oxygen (M ≈ 32). About 78% of  the molecules in dry air are nitrogen (N2). Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen (O2). The final 1% of dry air is a mixture of other gases. For any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present in a particular volume is constant – see ideal gas law. So when water molecules (vapor) are introduced into that volume of dry air, the number of air molecules in the volume must decrease by the same number, if the temperature and pressure remain constant.  (The addition of water molecules, or any other molecules, to a gas, without removal of an equal number of other molecules, will necessarily require a change in temperature, pressure, or total volume; that is, a change in at least one of these three parameters.  If temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume increases, and the dry air molecules that were displaced will initially move out into the additional volume, after which the mixture will eventually become uniform through diffusion.)  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas—its density—decreases. Isaac Newton discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book Opticks.[23] Humidity is one of the fundamental abiotic factors that defines any habitat, and is a determinant of which animals and plants can thrive in a given environment.[24] The human body dissipates heat through perspiration and its evaporation. Heat convection, to the surrounding air, and thermal radiation are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, blood brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air, and a condition called hyperthermia results. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, less goes to the active muscles, the brain, and other internal organs. Physical strength declines, and fatigue occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in heat stroke or hyperthermia. Humans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions, the rate at which perspiration evaporates on the skin is lower than it would be under arid conditions. Because humans perceive the rate of heat transfer from the body rather than temperature itself, we feel warmer when the relative humidity is high than when it is low. Some people experience difficulty breathing in humid environments. Some cases may possibly be related to respiratory conditions such as asthma, while others may be the product of anxiety. Sufferers will often hyperventilate in response, causing sensations of numbness, faintness, and loss of concentration, among others. Air conditioning reduces discomfort in the summer not only by reducing temperature, but also by reducing humidity. In winter, heating cold outdoor air can decrease relative humidity levels indoor to below 30%, leading to discomfort such as dry skin, cracked lips and excessive thirst. Many electronic devices have humidity specifications, for example, 5% to 45%.  At the top end of the range, moisture may increase the conductivity of permeable insulators leading to malfunction. Too low humidity may make materials brittle. A particular danger to electronic items, regardless of the stated operating humidity range, is condensation. When an electronic item is moved from a cold place (e.g. garage, car, shed, an air conditioned space in the tropics) to a warm humid place (house, outside tropics), condensation may coat circuit boards and other insulators, leading to short circuit inside the equipment. Such short circuits may cause substantial permanent damage if the equipment is powered on before the condensation has evaporated. A similar condensation effect can often be observed when a person wearing glasses comes in from the cold (i.e. the glasses become foggy).[25] It is advisable to allow electronic equipment to acclimatise for several hours, after being brought in from the cold, before powering on. Some electronic devices can detect such a change and indicate, when plugged in and usually with a small droplet symbol, that they cannot be used until the risk from condensation has passed. In situations where time is critical, increasing air flow through the device's internals, such as removing the side panel from a PC case and directing a fan to blow into the case, will reduce significantly the time needed to acclimatise to the new environment. In contrast, a very low humidity level favors the build-up of static electricity, which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, electrostatic discharges can cause dielectric breakdown in solid state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. Data centers often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons. Common construction methods often produce building enclosures with a poor thermal boundary, requiring an insulation and air barrier system designed to retain indoor environmental conditions while resisting external environmental conditions.[26]  The energy-efficient, heavily-sealed architecture introduced in the 20th century also sealed off the movement of moisture, and this has resulted in a secondary problem of condensation forming in and around walls, which encourages the development of mold and mildew. Additionally, buildings with foundations not properly sealed will allow water to flow through the walls due to capillary action of pores found in masonry products. Solutions for energy-efficient buildings that avoid condensation are a current topic of architecture. High humidity can often have a negative effect on the capacity of chemical plants and refineries that use furnaces as part of the process (e.g. steam reforming, wet sulfuric acid process).  The humidity will reduce the oxygen concentration, and the flue gas fans have to pull more air through the system to get the same firing rate (dry air is 20.9% oxygen, at 100% relative humidity the air is 20.4% oxygen).[27]","Sorry, it seems you were trying to access a page that doesn't exist. Please check the spelling of the URL you were trying to access and try again.","If you already know the meaning of ‘relative humidity’* you won’t need to refer to the paragraphs at the end of this post, either way I don’t think you will really need it, but it’s there just in case. All I know for certain is, everything is relative. My four days and five nights in Darwin were, relatively miserable, temperature-wise and humidity-wise–but otherwise, it was a good break, if by ‘good break’ you mean makes you really appreciate being home again. I decided some weeks ago to accompany my mostly sensible husband to Darwin while he participated in the NT Golf Open. I think he would agree with me in saying he didn’t actually compete, because competing would be another relative thing, as compared to endure, I suppose. Let’s just say he was not in the hunt for top honours. He did finish in front of  a handful of players out of the 200+ field so I suppose that is something. And more’s the pity, he did not even enjoy it. But I’m sure the next time he considers going to Darwin to play golf, the experience will immediately bring him to his senses. If not, he will have me to remind him, for which I’m sure he will be, not so much grateful as, annoyed. My plan was to catch up with friends. That was all. We usually stay in the city (small though it is) of Darwin, but this trip we decided to try a ‘boutique motel’ and hire a car. It was small, very small, but perfectly formed, save the very hard mattress; but good air conditioning and that was most important. Wipe that romantic notion about ceiling fans and mosquito nets being adequate in the tropics from your mind’s eye. That is just wrong. The suburb of Parap offers several cafés, restaurants, a gourmet food shop, a couple of gift shops and a gallery and a couple of other options, and a Saturday morning market that has always been a favourite, going way back to our days of living in Darwin. We saw the very first few stalls begin to trade about 30 years ago and it has steadily grown into a Darwin institution. Sadly, there is little food from the market I am able to eat these days, but wandering through at 7.30am, humidity at 93% and temperature at 26C (79F) was still worth it to grab a few photos. It was great to catch up with old friends and compare war stories. None of us escapes the ‘stuff’. Just as none of us will get out of this alive. We swap wisdom and compare treatments, catch up on our children and travels and before you know it the afternoon has slipped away. And at the end of the visit we always agree, we are relatively good. Lots of people we know are worse. Perhaps we are a tiny bit delusional too. We managed to take in a wonderful exhibition by paper artist, Winsome Jobling; and also to fit in a walk along the East Point foreshore, looking back at the city through Poinciana trees that have yet to gain their leaves and flowers because they have yet to get the dry season weather needed for that. It was hard work for me in the morning humidity. Later in the day I was ‘at one’ with that aforementioned hard mattress in the air conditioned motel room. To complain about the weather does nothing to improve it, but it was good to know it wasn’t only this desert dweller that was feeling the distress of extreme humidity where dry breezes should have been flowing. The locals were even feeling it. I gave up drinking hot coffee in preference to iced coffees, had two showers a day and had to hand wash undies and clothes because I forgot the ‘sweat factor’ of the top end when packing for a time when the dry season is not yet in full swing. We often remark that travel makes us appreciate home more, and this trip was especially true in that respect. But I wasn’t expecting what happened at the end. I arrived home and stepped off the plane onto the tarmac (there are no air bridges at Alice Springs airport) into a morning, post rain showers, where the humidity was exactly 93%, as it had been most of the mornings in Darwin, except that the temperature was 16C (60F), ten degrees below the Darwin temps in the early mornings. It felt glorious! And that, my friends, is the perfect illustration of relative humidity. As if blazoned on a neon sign atop the airport terminal it dawned on me, yet again, the wisdom of those three words ‘everything is relative’. (*Here is what Uncle Wikipedia says about relative humidity...“Humans are sensitive to humidity because the human body uses evaporative cooling, enabled by perspiration, as the primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Perspiration evaporates from the skin more slowly under humid conditions than under arid conditions. Because humans perceive a low rate of heat transfer from the body to be equivalent to a higher air temperature,[3] the body experiences greater distress of waste heat burden at high humidity than at lower humidity, given equal temperatures. For example, if the air temperature is 24 °C (75 °F) and the relative humidity is zero percent, then the air temperature feels like 21 °C (69 °F).[4] If the relative humidity is 100 percent at the same air temperature, then it feels like 27 °C (80 °F).[4] In other words, if the air is 24 °C (75 °F) and contains saturated water vapor, then the human body cools itself at the same rate as it would if it were 27 °C (80 °F) and dry.[4] The heat index and the humidex are indices that reflect the combined effect of temperature and humidity on the cooling effect of the atmosphere on the human body.”) When do you visit Vietnam? My husband (who has never been there) keeps telling me it can be comfortable, depending on what time of year you go, but I am not convinced. I can’t help it, I feel very uncomfortable with much humidity in temps above about 22C. Yes, the tropical fruit in the Top End is amazing. My personal favourite, now that I can no longer eat Mango, is the red papaya, with a generous squeeze of lime juice over it. Delicious. I really hope the Dry Season is well entrenched when you visit. It makes all the difference. Good friends that we’ve had for a long time are so special. Don has just come in from golf this afternoon and stated “I’m glad to report I can still play golf, I wasn’t sure after last weekend.” Yes, ‘a good idea at the time’. Thanks Dale. Clearly, I can’t do the heat and humidity thing any longer either, Roger! Actually I was never very good with it but in my younger years I could tolerate it better. Yes, good idea to read blogs before traveling to places. If you get on to a good one it is very revealing. Thanks for reading. Heavens above Ardys, had no idea you had resided in Australia for all those years – somehow thought Alice Springs was your first ‘stop’ 🙂 !  Thank you for those fabulous photos of Darwin: a place the QANTAS planes used to touch down a long, long time ago in the early morning hours with the airport bars still full of drunken locals !!  Have not been past that myself, but have travelled to most of the Pacific Islands and been to Singapore more times than I can count . . . sure one does need heaps of spare clothes for changing, but the humidity never fazed me . . . I ‘blossom’ around 30-35 C tho’ don’t much care past the 40 mark!! My good friend loves the warmth but not the extreme humidity. She also blossoms in higher temps than myself. I lived in Darwin after we were married for 8.5 years and really enjoyed it all except the humidity. I’m sure in those days the temps up there were a couple of degrees cooler too, though still not cool exactly. My husband was there from 1973 until we came to Alice in 1992. He remembers it when it was wild and wooly! Thanks for reading Eha. Great post!  After living in Houston, Texas, I try not to complain about humidity here in Oklahoma.  But sometimes I just have to!! Gee, Texas is getting hammered with ‘moisture’ at the moment, too! Yes, I try not to complain too much about the weather as it does nothing to improve it and makes everyone around you miserable listening to you, but sometimes it just has to be said! Thank you for reading Mimi. I grew up in a very dry climate, so when I moved to Oklahoma in the southern US, I loved the humidity for my skin and hair. I have never lived in extreme humidity so I cannot say how I would handle that. But it is a wonderful thing to experience and observe all things and draw something positive from it. That is what I can count on from you, Ardys. You see things in a beautiful perspective, and your photography especially, showcases that! 🙂 My philosophy is to find the positive in things. It may not change the outcome, but it makes the journey so much nicer! Southern Ohio had its share of humidity but the Tropics is a different level again. I will return to Darwin to visit my friends but I will try and remember to take twice the number of cool clothes and undies next time!!! Thanks Lori, you’re a gem.xx So nice to hear from you again. Am about to settle down after a busy morning and read your much anticipated latest post. It’s pretty rare that my suffering doesn’t yield some good lesson or decent photo!

An auto loan is a form of financing that allows an individual to purchase a car. The loan may be secured or unsecured, with unsecured loans usually offered by dealerships or banks. Oklahoma auto loans typically require the borrower to make monthly payments over a predetermined period to repay the loan amount. When applying for automotive loans, a person must provide personal and financial information such as proof of income, employment history, and credit score. This information will assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan and determine the loan's interest rate and other terms. Some lenders also offer special programs to help those with bad credit obtain loans. The loan amount will depend on the car's value and the borrower's creditworthiness. Generally, lenders require some collateral from borrowers, such as the title to the motor vehicle or money down, to secure the loan. Interest rates on auto loans vary depending on the length of repayment and the borrower's credit rating. Before signing for an auto loan, it's important to read all documents thoroughly and understand the terms and conditions. Knowing one's credit score, budgeting for potential increases in monthly payments, and understanding if an extended warranty is included in the loan are all important steps to take.

Get started now and take advantage of our flexible terms, competitive rates, and more! A: Online loans have several advantages over traditional lending options like banks and credit unions. Convenience, speed, accessibility, competitive rates, and transparency are among the benefits. In addition, online loans can be applied for from the comfort of your home, and loan decisions are frequently made quickly through automated systems. Online lenders may be more willing to work with borrowers with bad credit or who live in areas where traditional lenders do not have a physical presence. Due to lower overhead costs, online lenders may also offer lower interest rates and fees. In addition, they typically provide transparency in the lending process by providing upfront information on loan terms and fees. A: Yes, you can obtain a car loan even if you are currently unemployed. Some auto lenders will approve your loan without requiring you to have a job right now if you meet all of their other requirements. In addition to your employment history, lenders usually consider the following additional factors: If you don’t have evidence of employment-based income, you’ll most likely need to have excellent credit and make a substantial down payment. Depending on your credit score and job history, you may also need a co-signer for the loan. A: Comparing a network of lenders is beneficial for auto financing. It gives you access to multiple lenders, increases chances of approval, helps you find better interest rates and terms, saves time, and gives you the freedom to shop around without obligation. In addition, by comparing multiple lenders, you can quickly compare interest rates, loan terms, and fees to find the best deal for your specific financial situation and choose the best financing option for you. A: The monthly payments, interest rates, depreciation, and plans are some elements that affect a vehicle loan’s credit term. For example, long-term savings are typically realized with shorter loan terms due to reduced interest rates and quicker repayment. On the other hand, a longer loan period may make a more expensive vehicle more affordable and result in lower monthly payments. Finally, your unique financial circumstances and loan objectives will decide which loan term is best for you. A: Your ability to obtain auto financing relies on several variables, including your credit score, income, and the lender’s requirements. You might be qualified for financing a new or used car from a dealership or private seller if you have a good credit score and a reliable income. You might need to look into financing options with higher interest rates or work with a lender specializing in bad credit car loans if you have a low credit score or a limited income. It’s crucial to be aware that lenders might have limitations on the kind of car you can finance, depending on factors like the age, mileage, or state of the car. For instance, some lenders will only fund vehicles under 10 years old with less than 100,000 miles on them. To ensure you qualify for the kind of car you’re interested in buying, it’s always a good idea to study lenders and their requirements before applying for financing. A: A debt with simple interest has daily interest calculations. As you reduce the principal amount, the daily interest rate will drop. To calculate the daily interest charge, divide the interest rate percentage by 100. Then, subtract that amount from the total number of days in a year (365 or 366 for a leap year). This will determine your daily interest rate. A: Your credit history may reflect a late payment if your payment is 30 days or more past due. The effect of a late payment on your credit score depends on many variables, including the number of days past due, how recently you’ve been late, and how frequently you’ve been late. To remain informed of your situation, evaluate your credit report frequently. To obtain a free copy of your credit report, visit annualcreditreport.com or the national consumer reporting agencies Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, and Innovis. A: When looking for auto financing in Oklahoma, it's important to consider the interest rates, loan terms, and down payment requirements of each lender. You should also consider any additional fees associated with the loan, such as origination or prepayment penalties. A: It may be more difficult to get financing for a car with a bad engine, as lenders generally prefer to finance vehicles in good condition. However, some lenders may still offer to finance junk cars or vehicles that need significant repairs. A: To get a quote for auto financing in Oklahoma, you can typically fill out an online application with a lender or visit a dealership to speak with a finance representative. You'll need to provide information about your income, credit score, and the type of car you're interested in purchasing. A: When applying for auto financing in Oklahoma, you should consider your budget, credit score, and the type of vehicle you want to purchase. You should also research different lenders' requirements to find the best option. A: The time it takes to see results from your auto financing application in Oklahoma can vary depending on the lender and your circumstances.

who plays queen lannister in game of thrones,"Headey is best known for portraying Cersei Lannister in HBO's hit fantasy series Game of Thrones since 2011, a performance that has earned her four Emmy award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (2014 -- 16, 2018) and a Golden Globe Awards nomination for Best Supporting Actress -- Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2016. In 2017, Headey became one of the highest paid actors on television and could earn up to £ 2 million per episode of Game of Thrones (based on shared percentages of syndication payments). She also played the title character Sarah Connor on Fox's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and the villainous drug lord Madeline ""Ma-Ma"" Madrigal in Dredd.",Gary@BookCelebrities.com,"Game of Thrones divides its cast-members into a three-tiered system, with the members of tier one receiving the highest salaries. The numbers are a little more hazy on the rest of the cast. The second rung on the ladder, which includes such actors as Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), among others, are said to have received large raises in recent negotiations as well. While previous estimates put at least the younger members of this group in the $55,000 per episode range ($550,000 per season), we wouldn’t be shocked to learn if they’ve all been bumped up to six figures an episode given the show’s mammoth popularity. Above: Beautiful Game Of Thrones British Actress Sophie Turner Modeling For The Cover Of The Edit (Net-A-Porter Magazine) Modeling As One Of The Highest Paid Actresses In The World. Game of Thrones biggest stars – see on this page – are rumoured to be paid $300,000 an episode (or $2.1 million per season) after negotiating new contracts for a seventh season. They united to negotiate a $1 million an episode deal (about $7 million for the season) for the 10th and final season. The contracts do not guarantee that the characters of the actors will stay alive in the series. As expected, Tier A, aka the highest-paid level, includes the show’s lead actors, including Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister). Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (aka Jaime Lannister) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) are also included in this tier. Though the exact number of their renegotiated salary was not revealed at the time, Deadline reported that all of the Tier A actors are currently paid close to $300,000 an episode. For Dinklage and Headey, who were making $160,000 per episode in Season 4, the pay bump marked a nearly 100% raise. Since there are ten episodes per a season, the actors in this tier (at least those who weren’t temporarily killed off) will end each season having made a cool $3,000,000. Again, these deals were struck ahead of Season 5. Update 6/22/16: After the show earned high ratings and critical acclaim in its recent seasons, the Game of Thrones stars are again asking for a significant pay bumps. According to Deadline, the above mentioned Tier A actors will now all be paid north of $500,000 an episode for Season 7, which has been officially picked up, and Season 8, which is widely expected. While the pay raise helps secure the key cast for the series’ final run, it reportedly doesn’t guarantee that all five characters will survive til the show’s last episodes. Meanwhile, speculation is that both Season 7 and Season 8 will be shorter than previous seasons, possibly seven episodes for the former and six episodes for the latter. Per THR, the lower-salaried “B” tier includes co-stars Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and several others who remain unnamed. Of the names including in this tier, Williams is probably the most surprising, as her character Arya is a fan favorite and widely considered a staple of the show. However, some reports suggest that her younger age could have been a factor in knocking her down to the second tier. Though their salaries were not revealed at the time, THR reports that all of Tier B also scored raises in the 2014 negotiations (albeit smaller ones than those in Tier A). In return, these actors also extended their contracts through Season 7. What about the rest of the cast not included in Tier or Tier B? Per THR, there is reportedly also a third tier of regular actors who received much smaller pay increases during negotiations. Mother of dollars: Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys Targaryen, is in the top tier. No wonder he repays his debts: The show’s lead actors, such as Peter Dinklage, now earn roughly $US300,000 per episode. The stars of the Emmy-winning drama are in line to receive hefty salary raises for the likely eighth and potentially final season of the fantasy drama based on the books by George R.R. Martin, sources confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. Due to score sizable pay bumps are leads Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister). They’ll each earn upward of $500,000 per episode of season seven, which has already been announced, and in the likely eighth season (which is all but a formality). The raises for season seven come as part of an option HBO had with the cast as part of their last deal, signed in October 2014, that saw the five stars each become among the highest-paid actors on cable TV. The premium cable network had the option on season seven, and that has now been exercised and packaged with season eight. While the five stars are locked in, it does not guarantee that their characters will survive through what is expected to be the end of the series. HBO declined comment on the salary bumps. Season eight has not yet been announced but is wildly expected as the drama, from showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss is, in their words, “approaching the finish line.” The duo told THR ahead of the current sixth season — which wraps Sunday — that they are “writing the final act” and are “looking at somewhere between 70 and 75 hours before the credits roll for the last time.” Also unclear are just how many episodes seasons seven and eight will consist of. When season six wraps this weekend, Thrones will have aired 60 episodes, meaning the remaining two seasons could be short-orders to match the 75 hours producers have envisioned. The contracts of the remaining stars, including Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and others, has not yet been completed. Their last deal, in October 2014, also saw them net hefty raises with an option for season seven. Game of Thrones ranks as HBO’s most-watched series ever and is the premium outlet’s longest-running show currently on the air. But not in the way book readers were hoping, unfortunately. The season six finale borrows its title from the sixth novel in George R.R. Martin’s series — a book that remains unpublished. As such, Thrones veered away from the books during season six, and in many cases even revealed plot points ahead of Martin’s pace. (Here’s looking at you, Hodor.) The words “Winds of Winter” carry significant weight for fans of both Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire, serving as both a powerful sign of things to come, and a painful reminder of the book’s continued delay. The wait between seasons can be brutal. Though it seems a faraway memory now, Jon Snow’s death in the season five finale slammed into fans like a ton of ice bricks dropping from the top of the Wall. Will season six end on a similarly painful and even maddening cliffhanger? That’s unknown for now. What is known, however, is the fact that Thrones is closer than ever to its conclusion. Showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss have expressed their intent to end the series soon, with some debate about the exact amount of episodes remaining. “In the beginning, we hoped that if the show worked, we’d get seven seasons to tell the tale. Seven kingdoms, seven gods, seven books — seven felt like a lucky number,” Benioff and Weiss told THR ahead of season six. “The actual messiness of storytelling might not be quite that numerologically elegant, but we’re looking at somewhere between 70 and 75 hours before the credits roll for the last time.” Emilia Isabelle Euphemia Rose Clarke[1][2] (born 23 October 1986[3]) is an English actress. She is best known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in the HBO series Game of Thrones, for which she received two Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013 and 2015. Clarke made her Broadway debut in a production of Breakfast at Tiffany’s as Holly Golightly in March 2013. In 2015, she starred as Sarah Connor in the film Terminator Genisys. She was named Esquire’s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015. Sophie Turner (born 21 February 1996) is an English actress. Turner made her professional acting debut as Sansa Stark on the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones (2011-present), which brought her international recognition and critical praise. For her performance, she has received four nominations for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, as well as a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Supporting Young Actress in a TV Series. Turner has also starred in the television film The Thirteenth Tale (2013) and she made her feature film debut in Another Me (2013). She has also starred in the action comedy Barely Lethal (2015) and played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). Season six of Game of Thrones might be over, but you can relive the early glory of the Starks and the North with this very excellent audition tape of Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams trying out for the roles of Sansa and Arya Stark, respectively, nearly six years ago. The video clip splices two different audition clips of the actresses from 2010, where each reads opposite parts from the same scene (presumably with a line reader for the video); however, with the editing, it appears that the two girls are speaking to one another, despite the fact that the footage was taken separately. Lena Headey (born 3 October 1973) is a British actress. After being scouted at age 17, Headey worked steadily as an actress in small and supporting roles in films throughout the 1990s, before finding fame for her lead performances in big-budget films such as the fantasy film The Brothers Grimm (2005), the action film 300 (2007), portraying Gorgo, Queen of Sparta, and the adventure and biographical film The Red Baron (2008). Headey is best known for portraying Queen Cersei Lannister in HBO’s hit fantasy series Game of Thrones since 2011, a performance that has earned her two consecutive Emmy award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. She is also known for playing the titular character Sarah Connor on Fox’s Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and the villainous drug lord Madeline “Ma-Ma” Madrigal in Dredd. Margaret Constance “Maisie” Williams[1] (born 15 April 1997) is an English actress. She made her professional acting debut as Arya Stark in the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones, for which she won the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama, the Portal Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television and Best Young Actor, and the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. Williams has also had a recurring role in Doctor Who as Ashildr in 2015. In addition to television, she made her feature film debut in the mystery The Falling, for which she won the London Film Critics’ Circle Award for Young Performer of the Year. Natalie Dormer (born 11 February 1982) is an English actress. She became known for her roles as Anne Boleyn on the Showtime series The Tudors (2007–10), as Margaery Tyrell on the HBO series Game of Thrones (2012–16), Irene Adler on the CBS series Elementary (2013–15), and as Cressida in the science-fiction adventure films The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015). She has been nominated for Best Performance at the Gemini Awards for her work in The Tudors. She has also been nominated for a Screen Actor’s Guild Award for her performance in Game of Thrones. “From the moment she came in, she was on it: She was professional, and she was just brilliant,” actor Liam Cunningham says of the Lady of Bear Island. Jon Snow’s mother isn’t the only important Lyanna in the North, and not even the only important Lyanna of “The Winds of Winter,” the final installment of Game of Thrones’ eventful sixth season. Near the end of the episode, Lord Snow attempts to solidify the North behind his cause against the White Walkers, but his pleas fall on deaf ears. The tide only turns after a rousing speech from Lyanna Mormont, the Lady of Bear Island, no more than 10 years old and in command of no more than 62 soldiers — at least that’s the number she gives Jon back in “The Broken Man,” but no telling how the figure has adjusted in the wake of “Battle of the Bastards.” “Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly, but you refused the call,” she says, the ice-cold toughness of a world-weary warrior in her young voice. “You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refused the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day.” From there, it’s a short leap before all those in attendance lift their arms in favor of Jon Snow, King in the North, the White Wolf of Winterfell — and on the other side of the television, more than a few million viewers were pumping their own fists in support of Lady Mormont, rallying an entire region of Westeros more effectively than Jon Snow himself. Indeed, while she’s not serving Frey pies, Lady Mormont delivers the show’s version of one of George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire books’ most iconic lines: “The North remembers.” Lord Manderly owns this line in the source material; on the show, not only do those words belong to Lady Mormont, she pairs them with an epic tongue-lashing toward Manderly and his fellow Northerners. It’s not just the character on Game of Thrones and fans at home who were impressed with the ruler of Bear Islands, either. The cast and crew on hand for actress Bella Ramsey’s scenes were similarly impressed by the young star’s work. “From the moment she came in, she was on it: She was professional, and she was just brilliant,” Liam Cunningham, who plays Davos Seaworth, told THR about working with Ramsey during the season. “There’s an old adage about how actors should never work with children or animals, but that’s B.S. When kids are as good as this young lady is, it’s a joy to play opposite. She was absolutely amazing. When somebody comes in and is that good, it makes your job that much easier.” Mark Mylod, who directed Ramsey’s Game of Thrones debut in “The Broken Man,” remembers shooting the character’s first scene and immediately recognizing her instant hit status. “She walked in for the casting reading, and we were knocked completely sideways. It was one of those moments where you go, ‘Oh my God, what a star.’ You could not wish to meet a more delightful young lady. It was a four-and-a-half-page scene where we first meet that character, with Jon, Sansa and Davos all meeting her on Bear Island. We had a rehearsal day, and I think we were shooting midweek. The cast agreed to come in on their day off to work with this young actor, Bella. She’s so young that she still works on child hours, so we had a limited amount of time with her. We knew we had to work fast, and she had so much dialogue, as you may remember from the scene. We all came in on a Saturday morning to the set, and everyone was having a jolly day, thinking we would be coaxing this shy young child through the scene. We all had kid gloves on for the day. “After the first rehearsal, I remember thinking, ‘OK, this is going to be a very short rehearsal. She’s note perfect.’ The accent was awesome, her inflection and her professionalism. … We ended up rehearsing for only a half hour because she was so on it,” Mylod continued. “And of course, the rest of us felt deeply ashamed, because she knew every single word and every single inflection. We all went home feeling a bit deflated. (Laughs.) But also excited! Because the level of talent there is so ridiculous. She’s someone we’re going to look back on in 20 years, and she’s going to be ruling Hollywood. She’s just amazing.” Game of Thrones season six has been nothing short of exciting and revolutionary for the hit HBO fantasy series. But as it draws to a close this weekend (26 June), we’ll find ourselves a little lost on Sunday nights and finally forced to tackle the ironing pile. The newest season of GoT could not possibly top the last, but this one has gone and done just that. We’ve witnessed Sansa Stark’s escape – threatening her husband Ramsay Bolton’s status as heir to the North – before she lets him be devoured by his own dogs at the sensational Battle of the Bastards. Prior to that, Melisandre successfully resurrected Jon Snow after performing a bizarre ritual on him, and Daenerys Targaryen is brought to Vaes Dothrak to live out her days with the Dosh Khaleen having been captured by the khalasar. Jaime Lannister returned to King’s Landing with Myrcella Baratheon’s corpse and Bran Stark made good use out of his time travelling skills, amongst many other highlights throughout the season. But what about the numbers from season six? Take a look at the interesting figures behind the globally successful franchise. $10m: Was the cost of each episode of GoT – mounting to $100m for the season as a whole. 3: Was the amount of episodes it took for Jon Snow to be resurrected; he gasped his first breath at the end of episode three after being killed by several men of the Night’s Watch in the season five finale. 85,000: is the approximate number of people that have rated episode nine – the Battle of the Bastards – as the highest-rated TV episode of all time on IMDb. $500,000: Is the estimated amount of money that several main characters in GoT will now receive per episode for season 7.

Born in Acton, London, Harington studied acting at drama school, while starring in the National Theatre's adaptation of War Horse. His film debut was in Silent Hill: Revelation (2012). He has since appeared in films such as the romantic historical film Pompeii (2014), the computer-animated fantasy film How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) and the British drama film Testament of Youth (2014). Since 2011, Harington rose to prominence playing the role of Jon Snow in the HBO television series Game of Thrones, which garnered him a nomination for the 2016 Primetime Emmy Award. In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned £2 million per episode of Game of Thrones. Harington was born on 26 December 1986 in Acton, London, to Deborah Jane (Catesby), a former playwright, and Sir David Richard Harington, 15th Baronet, a businessman. His full birth name is Christopher Catesby Harington. His mother named him after Christopher Marlowe, whose first name was shortened to Kit, a name Harington prefers. Harington's uncle was Sir Nicholas John Harington, 14th Baronet, and his patrilineal great-grandfather was Sir Richard Harington, 12th Baronet. Through his paternal grandmother, Lavender Cecilia Denny, Harington's eighth-great-grandfather was Charles II of England. Also, through his father, Harington descends from Scottish politician Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville. Harington was a pupil at the Southfield Primary School from 1992 to 1998. When he was 11, his family moved to Worcestershire and he studied at the Chantry High School in Martley until 2003. He became interested in acting after watching a production of Waiting for Godot when he was 14, and he performed in several school productions. He attended Worcester Sixth Form College, where he studied Drama and Theatre (2003–05). When he was 17, he was inspired to attend a drama school after seeing a performance by Ben Whishaw as Hamlet in 2004. Harington moved back to London when he was eighteen and, a year later, attended the Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating in 2008. Before acting, Harington originally wanted to become a journalist. While still at drama school, he landed the role of Albert in the National Theatre's adaptation of War Horse. The play won two Olivier Awards and gained Harington a great deal of recognition. He was later cast in his second play Posh, a dark ensemble comedy about upper-class men attending Oxford University. After War Horse, Harington auditioned for and landed his first television role as Jon Snow in the television series Game of Thrones. The show debuted in 2011 to great critical acclaim and was quickly picked up by the network for a second season. Harington's role is largely filmed in Iceland and Northern Ireland. The series was renewed for a seventh season, which premiered on 16 July 2017, and will conclude with its eighth season in 2018/19.  Game of Thrones takes place on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and chronicles the power struggles among noble families as they fight for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Jon Snow is introduced as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, the honorable lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Harington has received praise for his performance. In 2012, Harington was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for the role. In 2016, Harington was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He said, ""It is a serious understatement to say that I am somewhat stunned ... For my work on Game of Thrones to be recognized in this way is an emotional moment for me. I could not be more humbled."" In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned £2 million per episode of Game of Thrones (based on shared percentages of syndication payments). Harington made his cinematic debut in 2012 as Vincent in Silent Hill: Revelation 3D. The horror film was based on the survival horror video game Silent Hill 3, and was a sequel to the film Silent Hill. He was honoured with Actor of the Year at the Young Hollywood Awards 2013, which celebrates the best emerging young talent in film, music and television. Harington's first major lead role in a feature film occurred when he played Milo in the Pompeii. Production for the film commenced in 2013 and took place in and around Toronto. Some scenes were also shot in the actual city of Pompeii itself. The film was a modest box office success and received mixed reviews from critics. That year, Harington also voiced Eret in How to Train Your Dragon 2, which was a critically acclaimed, box-office success, won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and received an Academy Award nomination. In 2014, Harington also appeared alongside Jeff Bridges in the film Seventh Son, a poorly received fantasy–adventure film. Harington played Roland Leighton, the main character's love interest, in Testament of Youth alongside Alicia Vikander and Emily Watson. The film was released in wide distribution in the UK on 16 January 2015. Its world premiere was in The Centrepiece Gala, supported by the Mayor of London, at the British Film Institute London Film Festival in October 2014. In December 2014, it was announced that he would feature in Xavier Dolan's upcoming movie The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, with Jessica Chastain, Kathy Bates, Thandie Newton and Susan Sarandon. Filming began in July 2016 in Montreal, Quebec and will run through to Spring 2017. He starred in the 2015 HBO comedy 7 Days in Hell, a short film about a 7-day tennis match. In June 2015, it was confirmed that Harington would star in Martin Koolhoven's upcoming western thriller film Brimstone, replacing Robert Pattinson. In 2016, Harington starred as the main villain in the first-person shooter video game Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. He is the driver in the current 2016 commercial for the Infiniti Q60 sport coupe car. It is his latest role for product commercials. On 19 February 2017, it was reported that he would star and executive produce a three-part historical drama for BBC based on the real story of the Gunpowder Plot. Harington will play the role of his ancestor Robert Catesby alongside with actors Mark Gatiss, Liv Tyler and Peter Mullan. Harington started dating Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie in 2012. They confirmed their relationship in 2016 and moved in together in 2017. © 2023 Surf Shop, Inc.",We can't find the page you're looking for.,,,,,

what's the difference between a safety valve and relief valve,"A relief valve or pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the ""path of least resistance"" as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid -- gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve's reseating pressure, the valve will close. The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats. The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns.","Quality products and efficient organisation, combined with a competitive price and a first class relationship with major international manufacturers, help us to satisfy the most demanding requirements of the valve market. A valve is a device that regulates the flow of fluids (either gases, fluidised solids, slurries or liquids) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. A ball valve (like the butterfly valve, one of a family of valves called quarter turn valves) is a valve that opens by turning a handle attached to a ball inside the valve. The ball has a hole, or port, through the middle so that when the port is in line with both ends of the valve, flow will occur. When the valve is closed, the hole is perpendicular to the ends of the valve, and flow is blocked. The handle position lets you ""see"" the valve's position. There are three general types of ball valves: full port, standard port, and reduced port. A gate valve is a valve that opens by lifting a round or rectangular gate out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar. The gate faces can form a wedge shape or they can be parallel. All gate valves have a rising or a nonrising stem. Rising stems provide a visual indication of valve position. Nonrising stems are used where vertical space is limited or underground. Bonnets provide leakproof closure for the valve body. Gate valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection and cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. Bolted bonnet is used for larger valves and higher pressure applications. Globe valves are named for their spherical body shape. The two halves of the valve body are separated by a baffle with a disc in the center. Globe valves operate by screw action of the handwheel. A bonnet provides leakproof closure for the valve body. Globe valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest bonnet, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. Bolted bonnet is used for larger or higher pressure applications. A Butterfly valve is a type of flow control device, used to make a fluid start or stop flowing through a section of pipe. The valve is similar in operation to a ball valve. A flat circular plate is positioned in the center of the pipe. The plate has a rod through it connected to a handle on the outside of the valve. Rotating the handle turns the plate either parallel or perpendicular to the flow of water, shutting off the flow. Check valveA check valve is a mechanical device, a valve, that normally allows fluid or gas to flow through it in only one direction. An important concept in check valves is the cracking pressure which is the minimum upstream pressure at which the valve will operate. Typically the check valve is designed for and can therefore be specified for a specific cracking pressure. Solenoid ValveA solenoid valve is an electromechanical valve (for use with liquid or gas) controlled by running (or stopping) an electrical current through a solenoid, (which is a coil of wire) thus changing the state of the valve. Solenoid valves may have two or more ports: in the case of a two-port valve the flow is switched on or off; in the case of a three-port valve, the outflow is switched between the two outlet ports.Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold. A spring may be used to hold the valve opened or closed while the valve is not activated. Relief ValveThe relief valve is a type of valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system by allowing the pressure source fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage, away from the main flow path. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the pressure setting is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the ""path of least resistance"" as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. In the petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing and power generation industries, the term relief valve is synonymous with the terms pressure relief valve (PRV), pressure safety valve (PSV) and safety valve. In most countries, such industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the ASME, API and other organizations must be complied with and those codes include design standards for relief valves.

Box 1236Russellville, AL 35653","A pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system.

When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the “path of least resistance” as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid or gas is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted process media is usually routed through a piping system or vented to the atmosphere. Most relief valves used in industrial applications base their relieving capacity on a percentage of overpressure beyond that of the cracking pressure. As seen in our Circle Seal 5100 series flow charts, the relieving capabilities are shown at 10%, 25% and 50% over the valves cracking pressure. These percentages allow the engineer to understand the flow characteristics of the valve at these common intervals. Most applications are designed to have the relief valve relieve overpressure at 10% of the valves cracking pressure, while other applications can allow up to 50% of overpressure to accumulate before it meets the required flow to relieve overpressure. As pressure increases so does the relieving capacity which can either be gradual or instant depending on the seal and set pressure. An example is our Circle Seal 500 series relief valves. When set to a lower cracking pressure such as 25 psi with soft seals, such as Buna N and Viton, they tend to gradually relieve the overpressure in a system. However, our Hoke R6000 series relief valve, which can be set to higher pressures, tend to quickly “pop off” and relieve excess pressure instantly. Standard noncoded relief valves serve their purpose for most of the applications out there. When the application involves boilers or pressure vessels, the most important single safety device is the pressure relief valve (PRV). The pressure relief valve is all that stands between overpressure conditions and catastrophic explosions. In most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also, in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) published section VIII Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code establishes safety regulations for boilers and pressure vessels. The VIII section gives detailed requirements for the design, fabrication, testing, and certification for both fired and unfired pressure vessels. It specifically refers to those pressure vessels that operate at pressures, either internal or external, that exceed 15 psig. Valves marked with the ASME stamp MUST achieve a large constant flow rate at no more than 10% overpressure to be ASME rated which ensures the protection of the pressure vessel and downstream equipment. Safety is the number one priority! There is no substitute for an ASME coded valve in an ASME application. Though many of these valves look like their non-coded counterparts, inspectors can easily spot a non-coded valve and can immediately shut down the system until the correct valve is installed. Circle Valve Technologies offers three series of safety relief valves that meet this ASME code, the M5100 series ASME, D500 Series ASME and the Rockwood Swendeman relief valve. These valves are unique, in that they must meet a specific flow requirement at a specific set pressure. Each valve is not only stamped with the ASME logo for visual inspection but also indicate their SCFM flow rate. Commonly found on Industrial and Cryogenic pressure vessels, the Rockwood Swendeman ASME RXSO series relieves quickly all while protecting the pressure vessel and downstream equipment. These are offered in bronze body material as found in the RXSO 710 series or stainless found in the RXSO-S 760 series and can be set from 15 psig to 400 psig. Our Circle Seal line also offers ASME rated valves in the M5100 ASME series and D500 ASME series with an adjustable range of 50-1200 psig for the M5100 series and 15-150 psig for the D500 series. Both series are available in your choice of naval brass or 316 stainless steel body materials and a manual override.

what is the definition of the name josephine,"Josephine is a female given name. It is the English version of the French name Joséphine. This is the feminine form of the name Joseph, which is taken from the Hebrew name Yosef, meaning ""Jehovah increases"".","Josephine is a female given name. It is the English version of the French name Joséphine. This is the feminine form of the name Joseph, which is taken from the Hebrew name Yosef, meaning Jehovah increases. It was originally a diminutive form of the French name Joséphe, and eventually became the standard form in the 19th century, replacing Joséphe, which eventually became a very rare name. Josephine is now the 260th most popular name in the USA. Diminutive forms of this name include Fifi, Jo, Josie, Joetta and Jojo, an Irish version ""Seosaimhín"", the Spanish version ""Josefina"" or Josephina and the Greek version Iosiphina (Greek: Ιωσηφίνα). Also spelled Yosefina and Gosefine. The Swedish version is Josefine. ""Josephine"" was a 1951 song with music by Wayne King and Burke Bivens and lyrics by Gus Kahn. Josephine is a 2001 English-language Croatian film directed by Rajko Grlić. It was shown at several international film festivals in 2001, but was never released to theatres as the production company filed for bankruptcy during the film's post-production. The domain name ""name"" is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. It is intended for use by individuals for representation of their personal name, nicknames, screen names, pseudonyms, or other types of identification labels. The top-level domain was founded by Hakon Haugnes and Geir Rasmussen and initially delegated to Global Name Registry in 2001, and become fully operational in January 2002. Verisign was the outsourced operator for .name since the .name launch in 2002 and acquired Global Name Registry in 2008. On the .name TLD, domains may be registered on the second level (john.name) and the third level (john.doe.name). It is also possible to register an e-mail address of the form john@doe.name. Such an e-mail address may have to be a forwarding account and require another e-mail address as the recipient address, or may be treated as a conventional email address (such as john@doe.com), depending on the registrar. When a domain is registered on the third level (john.doe.name), the second level (doe.name in this case) is shared, and may not be registered by any individual.  Other second level domains like johndoe.name remain unaffected. A name is a term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called ""common names"" or (obsolete) ""general names"". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or scientist can give an element a name. Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another. A feudal naming habit is used sometimes in other languages: the French sometimes refer to Aristotle as ""le Stagirite"" from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to Shakespeare as ""The Bard"", recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language. Also, claims to preference or authority can be refuted:  the British did not refer to Louis-Napoleon as Napoleon III during his rule. An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the ""object"" or class may be an idea, physical [countable] object (or class thereof), or physical [noncountable] substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those. The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an encoding system (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols stand for (represent) ideas or longer names) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a code or ID code. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be arbitrary IDs; they are arbitrarily assigned and have no greater meaning. (Sometimes identifiers are called ""codes"" even when they are actually arbitrary, whether because the speaker believes that they have deeper meaning or simply because he is speaking casually and imprecisely.)",,,,,,,,,

On December 7, 1787, it became the first of the 13 original states that ratified the US Constitution. Dover is Delaware’s capital city. Wilmington is the largest city and metro-urban area. English is not the official language in this state, yet most people speak English. Delaware has a growing Spanish-speaking population. In the US, Delaware is the 45th state by population rank. “Liberty and Independence” is the state motto of Delaware.  Check Key Facts of Delaware to learn more about this US state. The union adopted the Delaware flag on July 24, 1913. The flag’s background color is colonial blue. It encircles a buff-colored diamond, which has a coat of arms on it. Beneath the diamond is written “December 7, 1787”. This is the day on which Delaware became the first state to ratify the country’s constitution. The Delaware state seal, adopted on January 17, 1777, has the coat of arms. Around it, the words “Great Seal of the State of Delaware” is written. The dates 1793, 1847, and 1907 are also mentioned. In the middle of the coat of arms is a horizontal orange shield with blue and white stripes. The stripes symbolize a sheaf of wheat and corn cob. On the white stripe stands an ox. On top of the shield is a sailing ship. To the left of the shield is a farmer and to the right is a rifleman. Below the shield is the state motto. The ear of corn symbolizes the agricultural foundation of the state’s economy. The blue stripe on top of the ox stands for the Delaware River, the backbone of the state’s commerce. The Delaware location map shows the exact location of the US state of Delaware on the United States map. This map shows the US state’s boundaries, neighboring countries, and oceans. The State of Delaware is a tiny Mid-Atlantic US State. It rests on a peninsula and has beaches full of dunes. The beaches are on the borders of the Atlantic Ocean. Delaware’s coordinates are 38° 27′ N to 39° 50′ N Latitude and 75° 3′ W to 75° 47′ W Longitude. Check the Delaware Longitude and Latitude Map to learn more about the location. The time zone in Delaware is UTC−05:00 (EST). Its summer (DST) is UTC−04:00 (EDT). Delaware is spread across a total area of 1,980 sq mi (5,130 sq km). It is the second smallest state in the United States in terms of area. Delaware is majorly an unelevated, horizontal coastal plain with prosperous soil. The Delmarva Peninsula has overlapping regions with Maryland and Virginia. The state’s northernmost region is a section of the Piedmont Plateau. Delaware has two major land sectors: Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Piedmont is an area of smooth, undulating hills in the state’s northwest corner. It is 10 miles wide at its broadest point. The highest point in Delaware is found in Piedmont. It is only 450 feet above sea level. Check this Delaware Topographic Map to learn more. Learn about the location of mountain peaks, rivers, lakes, the state capital, state boundary, ocean, and neighboring states from this Physical Map of Delaware. Delaware’s climate is continental. The conventional four seasons make their presence felt one after the other. Summers are hot and humid, mainly inland in the Brandywine Valley and other rural regions. Before European colonists came to Delaware, Eastern Algonquian tribes or the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, occupied this land. They lived mainly along the coast and the Nanticoke, who controlled a large part of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. The Dutch were the first to settle in modern Delaware among the Europeans. They soon set up a trading post at Zwaanendael. However, in less than a year, all of the first settlers were killed by Native American tribes. In 1638, New Sweden was established as a trading post in Fort Christina, now known as Wilmington. Peter Minuit, a Swede who headed a group of Swedes, Dutch, and Finns, was instrumental in setting up this post. In 1664, Sir Robert Carr, an Englishman, led a fleet of ships and won over the Dutch. He was working under the instructions of the Duke of York. When the Duke handed over ownership to William Penn in 1682, he wanted access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province. Later, he leased the “Lower Counties” on the Delaware River from Duke. William Penn soon formed a representative government and brought together his two properties under one General Assembly in 1682. But, by 1704, the Province of Pennsylvania had become so big that its representatives wanted to make independent decisions. Eventually, the two groups began meeting separately at Philadelphia and New Castle. Penn and his descendants were proprietors of both. They appointed the same person as Governor for Pennsylvania and Lower Counties. The Lower Counties had no intention to break with Britain initially. Their relationships with the government were good, so they had more independence than the other colonies. The Wilmington merchants had trading links with the British. After the American Revolution, Delaware’s statesmen were one of the leading proponents of a strong central United States. They wanted equal representation for each state. Delaware has only three counties, the fewest among any US state. Sussex County is the largest county, having a total area of 1196.9 sq mi (3,100 sq km).

what's the population of the phoenix metropolitan area,"The Phoenix Metropolitan Area -- often referred to as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley or Metro Phoenix -- is a metropolitan area, centered on the city of Phoenix, that includes much of the central part of the U.S. State of Arizona. The United States Office of Management and Budget designates the area as the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), defining it as Maricopa and Pinal counties. As of the Census Bureau's 2015 population estimates, Metro Phoenix had 4,574,351 residents, making it the 12th largest Metropolitan Area in the nation by population. The gross domestic product of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was $215 billion in 2014, 15th largest amongst metro areas in the United States.","As of 2020, the Phoenix Metropolitan area consists of Maricopa and Pinal counties, comprising a total area of about 14,600 square miles. Because of the size of counties in Arizona, even though Maricopa and Pinal counties together contain nearly 4.9 million people, most of the area is uninhabited, which gives the MSA an extremely low density compared to other major MSAs in the nation. The average elevation in the city itself is about 1,100 feet (340 m), with the highest point being in South Mountain Park Preserve 2,704 feet (824 m).The highest point in the two county area is 7,657 feet (2,334 m) in the Four Peaks mountain range. Another quirk of a grid system based upon the Public Land Survey System is due to the occasional corrections in the grid caused by the curvature of the earth. This results in arterial roadways deviating slightly from a straight line, as can be seen in many locations where roads abruptly curve either just north or just south of Baseline Road to follow a new section line. This has been a source of confusion for a few newcomers, who might end up, for example, at 91st Avenue and Thunderbird Road, when in fact they intended to go to 91st Street and Thunderbird Road, between 30 minutes and an hour away from one another depending on traffic. Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport began commercial passenger flights in 2004. The airport provides service to over 40 destinations.",,,,,,,,,

where did the phrase man's best friend come from,"Previous to the 19th century, breeds of dogs (other than lap dogs) were largely functional. They served for activities such as hunting, watching, and guarding, language describing the dog often reflected these positions within society. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""In the oldest proverbs and phrases dogs are rarely depicted as faithful or as man's best friend, but as vicious, ravening, or watchful."" Beginning in the 18th century, multiplying in the 19th and flourishing in the 20th century, language and attitudes towards dogs began to shift. Possibly, this societal shift can be attributed to discovery of the rabies vaccine in 1869.",,,,,,,,,,

how old was lebron james when he started playing in the nba,"James was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance. At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game. He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and just the third player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.

The individual players of a winning team are presented with a ring, as a sign of honour for leading the team to its victory. Sometimes, these players are also presented other commemorative items such as a wrist watch, in place of the ring. But the greatest honour these players receive is the love and respect from the people around the world. The National Basketball Association, or NBA as we normally know it, it is one of the most viewed sport leagues in the world and the main event of professional basketball worldwide. The NBA seasons spans from October to June, in the meantime, 30 teams play each other to be crowned as the Champions. Competitive teams are made through drafts and trades. A good trade can become the key of a champion team or a dynasty. Here it is our list of the 10 greatest trades in NBA history. Arguably the best foreign player in NBA history, German power forward Nowitzki has played his entire 17-season career with the Dallas Mavericks. As a member of the Mavs, he has played 13 All Star Games; he won the MVP award in 2007 and the NBA Finals MVP award in 2011. To this point, he has scored 28,119 points with 3,282 assists and 10,051 rebounds and he is undoubtedly the franchise player of his team. That is why we rank him 10th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History. Nowitzki was selected by the Bucks in the 1998 NBA Draft (9th pick overall). The Mavericks acquired Nowitzki and Pat Garrity (19th pick) in exchange for Robert Taylor (6th pick), and later traded Garrity to the Suns for Steve Nash. In the meantime, Taylor’s NBA career lasted only 6 years. We know the rest. After 12 years of being the face of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Garnett was sent to the Boston Celtics on July 31, 2007 in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Theo Ratliff, cash and two draft picks. The deal constitutes the largest number of players traded for a single player in the NBA history. He made the 9th spot in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History for what it achieved later with one of the league’s most iconic franchises. Gernett played with Boston from 2007 to 2013. With them, he played 5 All Star Games, he won the 2008 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he scored 6,233 points with 1,078 assists and 3,301 rebounds and most importantly, he was a main piece in the team that won the NBA pennant in 2008, alongside Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, the “Big Three”. After a brief stint with New Jersey, since this season he’s back in Minnesota. Shaq is undoubtedly, one of the best centers in basketball history. After being part of the dynasty of Lakers in the early 2000’s, he was traded to the Miami Heat on July 14, 2004 in exchange for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant and one draft pick. At his arrive at Miami, Shaq promised he would bring a championship to the team. His promise came true in 2006 when the Miami Heat won their first championship trophy, although Shaq was not the best player (Dwyane Wade was). O’Neil played with Miami until 2008 and he scored 4,010 points with 437 assists and 1,856 rebounds and played three All Star Games. At the moment of his trade to Miami, he had won three NBA Finals MVP awards in a row and was the main piece of the Lakers that dominated the league in the previous years, and later he won one more championship with his new team, ranking 8th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history. He’s back to Cleveland, so we think the city has forgiven him since the decision. What most people think (or think to remember) is that James arrived to Miami as a free agency sign but it was actually a sign-and-trade deal between the Cavs and the Heat in exchange for future picks. After failing to win a Championship with the Cavaliers, James helped the Heat to win two NBA Championship as part of one the greatest trios in NBA history, composed of James, Chris Bosch and Dwayne Wade and that is why we picked it as 7th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history.  With Miami, James won also two NBA Finals MVP awards, played in three All Star Games and led the league in field goals with 758 in 2010-2011 and 765 in 2012-13 season, in two-pointers with 567 in 2011-12 and 662 in 2012-13. In four years with Miami he scored 7919 points with 1,980 assists and 2,225 rebounds. Kobe Bryant is probably the best player of his generation; he is undoubtedly one of the most popular and admired players of recent years and a winner: 5 NBA Championships. He has played 19 seasons in NBA, all of them with Los Angeles Lakers. In that span he has played 17 All Star Games, one MVP award, two NBA Finals MVP awards, led the league in games played three times, in field goals three times, in two-pointers three times, two times in free throws and four times in points. He has scored 32,482 points (3rd all-time), 8,146 free throws (3rd all time) and 11,321 field goals (7th all-time). An icon of the sport. What most people do not know is that Kobe arrived to Los Angeles through a trade. He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets in the 1996 draft as a 13th overall pick and later was traded to the Lakers, as agreed before the draft took place. Los Angeles didn’t tell the Hornets whom to select until 5 minutes before the draft. For what it represented later for the Lakers, he ranks 6th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history. The Bulls of the 90’s is, without any doubt, the most remembered team in the NBA history for their success, and much of this is due to Michael Jordan, but he did not win those Championships alone, he had a team and that team began with Scottie Pippen. In the 1987 NBA Draft, Pippen was selected by the Seattle Supersonics as the 5th overall pick and was sent later to the Bulls for Olden Polynice. Pippen later became one of the best defensive players of the league (8 times in a row selected for the NBA Defensive Team and the 1995 led in steals) and also a versatile scorer. He won six NBA Championships with the Bulls and played in 7 All Star Games. He ranks 5th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history since he seemed to be the missing piece in a Championships winner machine led by Michael Jordan. In twelve seasons with the Bulls he scored 15,123 points with 4,494 assists, 1,792 steals and 2,401 turnovers. If statistics were the only indicator to choose the basketball best player of all-time, Chamberlain would probably win that recognition. Holder of numerous records and achievements, Chamberlain is an iconic figure in NBA history. It was not different back at the end of the 67-68 season when he won his fourth MVP award with the Philadelphia 76ers and he was traded to los Angeles Lakers in exchange of Darral Imhoff, Jerry Chambers and Archie Clark, marking the first time a MVP winner would be traded the following season. The trade remains as one of the most lopsided in the history of the league and ranks 4th in our list of the 10 greatest trades in NBA History. With the Lakers, he won the 1972 Championship, the NBA Finals MVP award that year and played four All Star Games, two times selected for the NBA Defensive Team and led the league in rebounds three times. He scored 5,985 points during his tenure with Los Angeles plus 1,461 assists and 6,524 rebounds. In 1980 the Golden State Warriors made a deal with the Boston Celtics: they sent Robert Parish (their 1st round pick in the 1976 draft) and their 3rd pick of the 1980 NBA draft in exchange for Boston’s 1st and 13th picks of the same draft. With their 1st pick, Golden State took Joe Barry Carroll and Rickey Brown with their 13th, meanwhile Boston took Kevin McHale as the 3rd overall selection. The trade ended up forming one of the NBA greatest dynasties as Parish and McHale, alongside Larry Bird, led the Celtics to three championships: 1981, 1984 and 1986. Parish played 14 seasons with Boston with whom he earned stardom, became one of the greatest centers of all time and played 9 All Star Games. During his tenure at Boston, he accumulated 18,245 points with 1,679 assists and 11,051 rebounds. Kevin McHale, for the other hand, came out of the bench at the beginning of his career, winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award twice; McHale played thirteen seasons in his career –all with Boston- and totalized 17,335 points, 1,670 assists and 7,122 rebounds. The trade that formed the NBA Greatest frontline in history ranks third in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history. Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr., better known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, is one of the greatest NBA players of all time. He’s the all-time top scorer in the league with 38,387 points; his 17,440 rebounds rank third as well as his 3,189 blocks. He was Michael Jordan before Michael Jordan came to scene as he won 6 NBA Championships and the same number of MVP awards. Due to the historical impact of his, the trade that sent him to the Lakers from the Bucks in 1975 ranks second in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History. Jabbar arrived to the Lakers with Walt Wesley in exchange of Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman. In his first year with the Lakers he set the all-time record for most defensive rebounds with 1,111 and he became the last player to have 4,000 PRA (Points + Rebounds + Assists) in a year and won his 4th MVP award. Overall with the Lakers he won 5 NBA Championships, 3 MVP Awards, played 13 All Star Games, led the league in blocks two times, one time in rebounds and his uniform number 33 was retired. With the Lakers he scored 24,176 points (63% out of his total), 3,652 assists (64%), 10,279 rebounds (59%) and 2,694 blocks (84%). Bill Russell is an icon in basketball and one of the earliest. He made himself a legend with the Boston Celtics, a team with whom he played his entire 13 season career, winning 11 NBA Championships, 5 MVP Awards and 12 selections for the All Star Game. He was the first player to average more than 20 rebounds per game, he feat he accomplished 10 times. He’s second all-time in rebounds with 21,620 and led that department four times. He was definitely a better defensive player than offensive, as in his career he averaged only 15.1 points per game, had a .440 career field goal percentage and a 3.3 free throws per game and a success rate of .561, but he averaged 22.5 rebounds per game (second behind Chamberlain). The Boston Celtics acquired Russell through a trade and for his historical significance and sporting impact; it ranks first in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History. Russell was originally picked up by the Saint Louis Hawks in the 1956 NBA Draft, but they could not afford his contract and traded him to Boston (that were already interested in Russell) in exchange for Ed Macauley, Boston’s star at the time and who was willing to be sent to Saint Louis. Boston also sent Cliff Hagan and everybody happy. There are more trades that could have made the cut, we did not go for the most lopsided or shocking but for those that had the greater impact in the history of basketball best league in the world. The world of entertainment is that of glitz and glamour. It offers lucrative career options for all those who are talented and manage to establish themselves.

what was the sugar act and what did it do,"The Sugar Act, also known as the American Revenue Act or the American Duties Act, was a revenue-raising act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain on 5 April 1764. The preamble to the act stated: ""it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this Kingdom ... and ... it is just and necessary that a revenue should be raised ... for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same."" The earlier Molasses Act 1733, which had imposed a tax of six pence per gallon of molasses, had never been effectively collected due to colonial evasion. By reducing the rate by half and increasing measures to enforce the tax, the British hoped that the tax would actually be collected. These incidents increased the colonists' concerns about the intent of the British Parliament and helped the growing movement that became the American Revolution.",,,,,,,,,,
where did the name london broil come from,"London broil is a beef dish made by broiling marinated beef, then cutting it across the grain into thin strips. Despite its name, the dish and the terminology are North American, not British.","When it’s holiday time, a lot happens and the smell of meat hitting our nostrils cannot be ignored. Also, words start getting thrown from here to there, people trying to get their share of the much-needed commodity. In the rush, you won’t fail to hear the commonly used words like London broil and Flank steak. These are excellent choices of meat for at-home Philly cheesesteak, bibimbap, stir-fries, and other favorite beef meals. Some buyers and butchers will call flank steak London boil while others will refer to flank steak as London broil. It’s a big confusion yes, especially for anyone who does not have an idea of the various meat categorizations. In light of that, this post seeks to bring out the differences between the Flank steak and London Broil. As it is always with these posts, it does not intend to give an opinion on what meat is better than the other. Also, it does not seek to weigh the options for you as the buyer. The flank steak is a beef steak that is usually cut from the lower chest or abdominal muscles of a cow. Commonly, the cut is associated with Colombia and is usually referred to as sobrebarriga which literary means “over the belly”. In South America, a thin flank steak is referred to as a matambre in Spanish. It is also known as a fraldinha in Brazil, literally meaning “little diaper”. This is because of its position that is near the cow’s groin as well as its shape that resembles a cloth diaper. The flank steak is relatively a long and flat cut and is used in a variety of dishes. The dishes include the London broil and can also be used as a substitute for the traditional skirt steak in fajitas. The flank steak can be pan-fried, grilled, braised for increased tenderness, or broiled. The London broil is a beef dish usually made by boiling marinated beef and then cutting it across the grain in thin strips. Regardless of the name London broil, the dish, as well as the terminology, are North American and not British. The traditionally used cut meat for the London broil is the flank steak. However, some people will use the blade roast, top rounds, or the sirloin tip roasts in this dish. Many butchers will label such cuts as top round steak and roast as London broil even though the term does not refer to any specific cut of meat. It only refers to the method of preparation and cookery. Preparing the London broil usually involves the margination of the meat for several hours. The margination is then followed by high heat searing in an outdoor grill or oven broiler. Then, it is served in thin slices that are cut across the grain. If it is cut and used for sandwiches, it is usually rarer than any traditional roast beef. Even though the two have several differences, they also have some similarities. The main ones are that the two are characterized by thin slices and have plenty of pink meat. The flank steak is cut from the lower section of the cow or the abdominal muscles. The area is usually the succulent loin, but it’s before the muscular sinews of the round. The London broil, on the other hand, is a beef dish that is made from boiling marinated beef. The flank steak is a meat cut that is mostly used in the style of preparation while London broil refers to a method of cooking the flank steak. Even though some butchers and even cooks often use the terms London broil and flank steak interchangeably to describe the same cuts, these two are not at all synonymous. To the identity-conscious culinary pedants, the two can never be used in place of each other. As the name suggests, the flank steak is a meat cut sourced from a specific area of a cow, while the London broil is usually a method of cooking the various lean cuts similar to and including the flank steak. Simply, it can be concluded that the London broil is a method of cooking while the flank steak is a cut of meat mostly used in the style of preparation. I think there are some serious spell check problems here.  The word  “margination” means the act of forming a margin, I think you meant marinate the act of soaking something in a marinade.  Additionally you seem to use boil and broil interchangeably.  To boil meat after you have marinaded it would be almost criminal.  I guess the MFA program at Amherst didn’t care about spelling. “The flank steak is a beef steak that is usually cut from the lower chest or abdominal muscles of a cow. Commonly, the cut is associated with Colombia and is usually referred to as sobrebarriga which literary means “over the belly”. The local supermarkets sell a cut of beef as London broil before it is cooked. I doubt if they are referring to a method of cooking.

what is the chemical composition of citric acid,"Citric acid is a weak organic acid that has the chemical formula C O. It occurs naturally in citrus fruits. In biochemistry, it is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.","2918.14.00 C6H8O7.H2O C6H8O7.H2O Citric acid is a weak organic acid with formula C6H8O7, which occurs naturally in citrus fruits. It is part of the citric acid cycle which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms. Globally, more than a million tons of citric acid are produced annually, and more than 70% of the total production is used in the food and beverage industry as an acidifier or antioxidant to preserve or enhance the flavors and aromas of fruit juice, ice cream, and marmalades. Citric acid exists in the form of anhydrous, which is crystallized in hot water, or monohydrate, which is crystallized in cold water. The anhydrous form of citric acid can be produced by heating citric acid monohydrate. Citric acid is produced by submerged fermentation using fungus from different sources of carbohydrates, such as molasses and starch-based media. As precipitation, calcium oxide is added to form the slightly soluble tri-calcium citrate tetrahydrate. The precipitate is removed by filtration and washed to remove impurities. It is treated with sulphuric acid to form calcium sulfate and filtered off. The citric acid liquid is then treated with active carbon and passed through a cation and anion exchanger. Finally, the liquid is concentrated in vacuum crystallizers at 20 - 25℃, forming citric acid monohydrate. Citric acid is widely used in the food and beverage industry for different purposes. Some food that contains citric acid includes jellies, jams, candies, dairy product, frozen fruit, oils, and animal feed. Beverages such as wine, ciders, soft drinks, and syrups also contain citric acid. Citric acid can be used for pH adjustment and preservation and can be used as an antioxidant agent, sequestering agent, acidulate, and flavor enhancer. Citric acid is also used in pharmaceuticals. It is combined with bicarbonates to use as an effervescent and anticoagulant. It is also used to adjust pH and as an antioxidant agent. Citric acid is used to increase the solubility of brown heroin. It is also used as feed in the production of antiviral tissues. Citric acid is used as an agricultural repellent against frogs, especially in Hawaiian plants. As a corrosive and acidic compound, the amount of citric acid for plants must be specified. Adding too much citric acid can cause acidic soil, which can burn the plant root and cause the plant’s death. Citric acid is used to remove metal oxides for the operational cleaning of iron and copper oxides. In industrial applications, citric acid is used as a buffering and neutralizing agent. It is also used in non-corrosive, non-toxic, and biodegradable processes and safety standards. Other uses include ceramic manufacture, ion complexion, leather tanning, copper plating, floor cement, adhesive, waste treatment, electroplating, textile, bottle washing compound, etc. © 2023 Tradeasia Internasional Inc.

which was a factor that led to bacon's rebellion,"Bacon's Rebellion was an armed rebellion in 1676 by Virginia settlers led by Nathaniel Bacon against the rule of Governor William Berkeley. The colony's dismissive policy as it related to the political challenges of its western frontier, along with other challenges including leaving Bacon out of his inner circle, refusing to allow Bacon to be a part of his fur trade with the Indians, and Doeg American Indian attacks, helped to motivate a popular uprising against Berkeley, who had failed to address the demands of the colonists regarding their safety.","In 1607, members of a joint venture called the Virginia Company founded Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America on the banks of the James River. Famine, disease and conflict with local Native American tribes (the Powhatan Tribe) in the first two years brought Jamestown to the brink of failure before the arrival of a new group of settlers and supplies in 1610. Named for Queen Elizabeth I of England (known as the Virgin Queen). Bacon's Rebellion- Bacon's Rebellion was an armed rebellion in 1676 by Virginia settlers led by Nathaniel Bacon against the rule of Governor William Berkeley. The colony's disorganized frontier political structure, combined with accumulating grievances (including leaving Bacon out of his inner circle, refusing to allow Bacon to be a part of his fur trade with the Native Americans, Indian attacks), helped to motivate a popular uprising against Berkeley, who had failed to address the demands of the colonists regarding their safety. About a thousand Virginians of all classes rose up in arms against Berkeley, attacking Native Americans, chasing Berkeley from Jamestown, Virginia, and ultimately torching the capital. The rebellion was first suppressed by a few armed merchant ships from London whose captains sided with Berkeley and the loyalists. Government forces from England arrived soon after and spent several years defeating pockets of resistance and reforming the colonial government to one more directly under royal control. The trade that pertains to Virginia is Tobacco and Glass Artifacts. After receiving Tobacco seeds from Europe, Virginians began to export Tobacco to everyone. The Glass Artifacts were traded among themselves. Religion and politics are intimately linked in Colonial Virginia. The Church of England practiced a form of Protestant Christianity that in some ways resembled Catholicism. Virginia is a Royal Colony that was started by the Virginia Colony in hopes of discovering gold.

what are two towers in lord of the rings,"The meaning of the title itself,' The Two Towers', was changed. While Tolkien considered several possible sets of towers he eventually created a final cover illustration and wrote a note included at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring which identified them as Minas Morgul and Orthanc. Jackson's film names them as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, symbolic of an evil alliance out to destroy Men that forms the film's plot point. The film depicted Saruman openly presenting himself outright as Sauron's servant, whereas this association was not explicitly stated in the novel (and indeed analysis by Gandalf and Aragorn in the chapter ""The White Rider"" stated that there was a rivalry instead, as Saruman was afraid of the prospect of being at war with Sauron, if Rohan and Gondor fell).","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a film which was directed by Peter Jackson, with a theatrical runtime of 179 minutes (2 hours, 59 minutes). It is the second part in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. It's screenplay is written by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It is an adaptation of the book The Two Towers, the second part of the three-volume novel The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, although some of the later events are held over to the later third movie, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.The film premiered at Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, on Thursday, 5 December, 2002. It was very well received critically and was an enormous box-office success, making over $900 million worldwide (making it the fourth most successful film of all time at that point in time). The surviving members of the Fellowship of the Ring have split into three groups. Frodo and Sam face many perils on their continuing quest to save Middle-earth by destroying the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs and must convince the Ents to join the battle against evil. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter a mysteriously transformed Gandalf and battle Saruman's army at Helm's Deep. * denotes a scene only available in the Extended Edition cut of the film. ** denotes a scene which includes extended content only available in the Extended Edition cut of the film. Jackson's The Two Towers differs from Tolkien's in several important ways. Arwen does not appear in the second book at all. Interviews with Jackson and the other writers on the extended DVD version of the movie make it clear that they are fully aware of the implications of these changes in terms of the original story, and have chosen to make them not out of ignorance but in order to make the story work better in terms of motion picture storytelling. Notably the meaning of the title itself, 'The Two Towers', has been changed. Tolkien considered many possible combinations, but eventually settled on Orthanc and Minas Morgul being the 'two towers'. However, in Jackson's movie Saruman instead names them as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, which is also reflected in the movie poster. Tolkien divided The Two Towers into two distinct parts. The first told the stories of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and Gandalf. The second concerned Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Jackson chose to intercut between the two to present the events in chronological order. Jackson's structure changes the tale from a pure quest to a war story. Each of the film's three main threads make the point that the war has started and that our heroes are in the thick of it. Théoden's attitude towards the coming conflict is also presented differently in Jackson's film: In the novel, Théoden chooses to ride to war, and only goes to Helm's Deep in order to assist Erkenbrand's forces, which had been dealt a defeat by Saruman's armies. In the film, he opts to avoid open confrontation, and treats Helm's Deep as a shelter for the civilian population of Rohan. Only the ensuing orc siege forces him into battle. The theatrical edition of the movie was released on VHS and DVD on Tuesday, August 26, 2003. The DVD was a 2-disc set with extras on the second disc. This was intended to be a simultaneous worldwide release, but some British stores began selling the videos on Friday 22 because it was a Bank Holiday weekend, much to the ire of the film's UK distributor, which has threatened to withhold advance supplies of subsequent video releases. An extended version of the movie including 44 minutes of additional material was released on video on Tuesday, November 18, 2003, with a total of 223 minutes (3 hours, 43 minutes). One of the additional scenes features Sean Bean and John Noble, who do not appear in the theatrical version, in a flashback in which brothers Boromir and Faramir are seen together with their father Denethor. This is available on VHS and on a 4-disc DVD set, with the movie on discs 1 and 2 including four audio commentaries by the crew and actors, and extensive bonus material on discs 3 and 4. There is also a ""Special Edition"" DVD package containing the 4-disc set, a sculpture of Gollum, a booklet about the process of designing Gollum for the movie and a short DVD documentary on the process of designing collectible sculptures based on the movies' characters and artefacts. In December, 2003 there were also limited back-to-back theatrical releases of the extended versions of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers followed by premieres of The Return of the King, in all nine hours and seventeen minutes long. In the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends episode ""Duchess of Wails"", the end of the episode is a homage to the attack on Helm's Deep from the movie. Certain lines are used in the scene's dialogue as well as memorable visual moments, like the initial volley of arrows (tomatoes in the episode) are also used.","Real money casinos are incredibly popular in the UK, and for good reason.

Real money gambling sites are transparent in how they make money, and provide players with the chance to potentially win real money. Social gambling games, however, employ more deceptive tactics that can be detrimental to players. These can include sharing your data and showing numerous ads, as well as charging microtransactions for extra features.

Playing at a UK Gambling Commission-licensed online casino is the only way to ensure your safety and security when playing real money casino games. All UKGC-licensed sites must meet strict standards of safety and security, giving you peace of mind that your personal information and money are protected. Playing online slots or other casino games through social media platforms such as Facebook cannot guarantee the same level of protection, so it is always best to stick with licensed and regulated sites for your online gaming needs. There are both arguments for and against participating in real money casino games. Let's review the points we have discussed now. One of the key benefits of playing demo or free-play versions of online casino games is the ability to try out different features first-hand without risking any money. This allows you to get familiar with the game mechanics in your own time and make sure that you understand exactly how everything works before gambling with real money. Demo version games let you “try before you buy” so that you can be confident when playing for real money. Unfortunately, this option is not available at real money casinos, as you cannot practice games without investing your own cash. Demo play can be a great way to familiarize yourself with online casino games that require strategy or knowledge of the rules. For instance, playing free versions of poker online before you start playing for real money can help you learn the game and improve your skills. With real money casinos, there is usually no option to practice first and you have to dive right in. For those who would like to enjoy the excitement of casino games without putting their hard earned money at risk, there are a number of no-deposit online casinos that offer real money gaming with no risk. At these casinos, players can play their favorite games and even win prizes without having to put any money on the line. This is a great way to experience the thrill and excitement of casino gambling without worrying about potentially losing your own funds. When playing casino games for real money at an online casino, you can be sure that the games are fair and not rigged. This is because most sites use Random Number Generators (RNG) which are regularly tested by eCogra to ensure that they are producing random and unbiased outcomes. Live Casino games have additionally been subject to rigorous standards and safeguards in order to ensure fairness, as they are video streamed from live casinos or audio-video studios, making it impossible to influence the game's outcomes. As a result, you can play your favorite online casino games with confidence knowing that the results will be truly random. When researching different casino games, you will come across the RTP (or return to player) percentage. This is an important factor for many players as it gives you a sense of how often you are likely to win back over time. For example, if you play an online slot with an RTP of 95%, you can expect to receive £95 for every £100 bet on average. Most online slots have an RTP between 95-97%, but some games go even higher. It's important to remember that gambling is reliant on luck and therefore the RTP is not a guaranteed return - one player could play £100 and not win anything, while another hits a jackpot on their first spin. Online slots have higher RTPs than land-based casinos because the overhead costs associated with running a slot site are lower than those in real-life venues (e.g. staff, rent, utilities). Additionally, volatility should also be taken into consideration along with the RTP as it relates to the size of individual winnings; low volatility slots will pay out more often but with similar amounts per win, while higher volatility slots may have larger prize pots but they don't occur as frequently. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) is a government body established to regulate gambling activities in the United Kingdom as part of the Gambling Act 2005. It works alongside local licensing authorities to oversee the online gambling market. If you are unsure if an online casino or betting site is legitimate, you can check for a UKGC licence number on the website's footer or homepage. You can then verify that the license is valid by checking it against the Gambling Commission’s online register. This will ensure that the site is operating within legal and ethical guidelines. In order to qualify for a remote gambling licence, online casinos must prove to the UKGC that they have satisfactory monetary policies and safety protocols in place. All approved UK online casinos religiously follow rigorous laws with the goal of shielding players from harm and theft.

where did the saying pig in a poke come from,"The idioms pig in a poke and sell a pup (or buy a pup) refer to a confidence trick originating in the Late Middle Ages, when meat was scarce, but cats and dogs were not. The scheme entailed the sale of a suckling pig in a poke. The bag, sold unopened, would actually contain a cat or dog, which was substantially less valuable as a source of meat. The French idiom acheter (un) chat en poche (to buy a cat in a bag) refers to an actual sale of this nature, as do many European equivalents, while the English expression refers to the appearance of the trick.","OKAY … there are three questions I’m wondering about, when it comes to British Columbians deciding on IF we change how we currently vote. And … if we do, what that new system will be. Why are we not getting an explanation of who will decide on the proportional representative going to legislature.  As it stand now, they won’t be voter elected but potentially, at least, party hacks. Right now many / most of us complain that our elected representatives DO NOT in fact represent us; instead represent the party they belong to.  Basically they do as they are told.  On the other hand, maybe they will be voter elected, perhaps by using the votes each has received, and picking the one(s) who received the most. Here’s another good one, I believe.  Question #2 Hmmmmmmmm … no answer for that either. I know, we’re supposed to trust them.  Here’s the thing though, I’m not will to make the buy, without knowing what I’m actually buying.  Really, do you go out and purchase an unknown bag of goods, when you go to the store, and then wait until you get home to see what they’ve given you? Now here’s what someone said about riding boundaries; “It is not the job of the government to change riding boundaries. The law requires an independent boundaries commission. And that process can take up to 18 months.” And they are right, of course.  It is not the government that decides this … it is, or will be, an independent commission. HERE’S THE THING THOUGH.  Any time we have had changes to riding boundaries (and they were generally jerry rigged), it was done prior to an election.  In this case, our GreeNDP government is wanting us to change how we vote, PRIOR to knowing what the boundaries will be. I’m not really very comfortable with that.  And, what’s the rush?  We’ve been voting the way we have for decades and decades; what’s one more election? There’s still too many questions, and I for one am willing to wait to have a referendum, until we have all of the answers first — or at least answers to the majority of the questions I have first. IF we all have an understanding that there WILL be a FAIR referendum on how British Columbians vote (on the future make-up of the B.C. Legislative Assembly), then we can go into the next election knowing NO party will attempt to subvert that will. The NDP … The Green Party … the BC Conservative Party … the Liberal Party.  ALL should be required to make that commitment. So, at the moment, I can safely say that I am not really warmed up to changing our First Past The Post option of voting.  That said, I am open to finding out more about the options that will be presented to us this Fall in the referendum.  That’s why I will be attending the Fair Vote Kamloops presentation with Dr. Dennis Pilon of York University, July 4 at 7 p.m., at the Clocktower Theatre at TRU.  His topic will be, “Changing B.C.’s Voting System, Arguments and Facts.” Meantime, find out everything you can, on the options available to us, and don’t be swayed, either way, by a chorus of clanging gongs.  Here’s just a few websites that will get you started: How We Vote: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018AG0041-001071 Fair Ways BC Could Vote:  https://fairvotingbc.com/join-the-campaign-for-fair-voting/fair-ways-bc-could-vote/ Vote No To PR: https://www.nobcprorep.ca/ Elections BC — 2018 Referendum: https://elections.bc.ca/referenda/ In Kamloops, I’m Alan Forseth … and I look forward to seeing your thoughts below in the Comment Section. Alan Forseth is a Kamloops resident and former member of the Reform Party of Canada and the B.C. Reform Party, and a past and current member of the BC Conservative Party. His blog is My Thoughts on Politics and More. Some form of proportional representation is used in around 94 countries in the world, including, Ireland, which has had PR since 1922!  Other countries are Norway, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium,New Zealand, Denmark. Former pm of New Zealand, Helen Clark who recently spoke in Vancouver (see her talk on youTube, said she was wary at first, but found the government got a lot done with more cooperation between the parties.  We don’t have to reinvent the wheel here in BC, and frankly, I am tired of our elected “dictatorships”. Provincially and federally. Valid questions, but not deal breakers. All the options presented guarantee local representation, exclusion of “fringe” groups, and, most importantly, inclusion of virtually every voter’s vote.  Hopefully the benefits of Proportional Representation, and the fact that we will vote on whether to keep it after we have tried it, will give you the courage to vote Yes. Thank you for a thoughtful commentary.  A few things for your consideration. The bag of goods isn’t completely unknown.  You know, for example, that it contains milk and chicken breasts, as it always does.  As always, you don’t know how MUCH milk and how MANY chicken breasts, nor do you know with any certainty that the milk doesn’t turn out to be soured, or the chicken breasts rancid.  With this new bag of goods, you can be fairly confident it will also contain bananas and potatoes, and maybe even a dessert!  Still, you won’t know the bananas aren’t blackened, the potatoes haven’t sprouted, or the dessert turned out to be ice cream that melted all over everything.  This is where you still need to hold the packer of each item to account.  Over time, the packers may come to realize it is not okay, or cost effective, to spend the next four years providing an inferior quality of goods, even with the most room in the bag. You don’t want to do this in a rush.  That is good, since this country has been talking about electoral reform and proportional representation since at least 1921.  We’ve had around 13 or 14 commissions, committee studies, citizen studies, etc. during that time, and they have ALL concluded that proportional representation is the way to go.  I’d hate to see your definition of taking it slow. But mostly, I’m surprised at the faith you have in the political party back rooms.  In spite of knowing that, today, party hacks are put into ridings where the wishes of the citizens of that riding are completely subsumed by the wishes of the party back room.  Having 100% unfettered power is difficult to voluntarily give up.  It is human nature, or at least political human nature.  But, some can look long-term and realize that 100% power today isn’t worth zero power tomorrow, even the possibility of no party status as happened recently in Ontario.  As we heard from Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, her party was against ProRep when it first came in.  But after experiencing it for 21 years, she is now a strong proponent.  Perhaps, as we learn from Samara’s exit interviews, it is because our politicians are demoralized by the realization they have been nothing more than friendly, well-intentioned puppets on a string.  I expect they’d be happier if they could have had the pride of a shopping bag better filled. Nothing has convinced me that proportional representation will be better than first past the post,  I also have a real issue with the “for” sides stance that those of us against it are ignorant, uninformed, etc etc. 2. If an MLA dies or resigns during their term in office what is the matter with a by-election held under PR rules? Isn’t it more likely that the person then elected would, through PR’s collaborative nature, represent a broader group of voters willing to contribute to consensus? 3. Isn’t the purpose of a referendum on electoral reform to decide, particularly, the answer to the referendum’s first question – ie  Do we want to stay with FPTP or switch to some form of Proportional Representation? Once decided isn’t it a reasonable assumption that all parties – NDP – – – Green – – – Conservative – – – Liberal – would commit themselves to producing the best legislation possible for the voting public, not just for their party? So, at the moment, I can safely say that I have had to live with the undemocratic nature of FPTP my entire life, have usually been unrepresented both federally and provincially, am convinced that any form of PR is far superior in representing the increasing diversity of opinion than does our present system, and realize that any new system will have to resolve some of the nitty-gritty details over the two term testing period recommended.  That’s why I will be attending the Fair Vote Kamloops presentation with Dr. Dennis Pilon of York University, July 4 at 7 p.m., at the Clocktower Theatre at TRU.  His topic will be, “Changing B.C.’s Voting System, Arguments and Facts.” Much like Mr. Forseth I seriously recommend you make this part of your research into this important issue. Certainly my foremost objection to voting for change is the naming of party hacks from a list known only to the party. Never will I ever sit still for that. All this talk of party hacks makes me think that voters don’t realize that our current system gives us closed party lists that are exactly one name long — take it or leave it. At worst, this would stay the same under PR — the names would be on the ballot and have been decided by the party. At best (and this is the most likely option, IMHO, since no one is advocating closed party lists) we would have competition among candidates from the same party. Doesn’t that sound like a breath of fresh air? Can someone explain to me how this whole “party hack” thing could possibly get worse under PR? Sorry, but your column is just more useless blather from someone that is scared of change. Grouchy is an apt name it seems.  I have indicated I am MORE THAN willing to consider change — I’m simply not willing to “buy a pig in a poke**”.  I have indicated this so far that I am indeed planing on attending the Fair Vote Kamloops presentation taking place July 4th.  The questions I have posed, and those of others, deserve to have answers.  IF we are going to change how we DEMOCRATICALLY elect our representative, it is only fair we know fully what that entails.  I think my example of buying a pig in a poke could potentially (at least) be apt given the information which is still missing. ** The idioms pig in a poke and sell a pup refer to a confidence trick originating in the Late Middle Ages, when meat was scarce, but cats and dogs were not. The scheme entailed the sale of a suckling pig in a poke. The bag, sold unopened, would actually contain a cat or dog, which was substantially less valuable as a source of meat.

what is so special about the pulmonary arteries and veins,"The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The largest pulmonary veins are the four main pulmonary veins, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary circulation.","The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart – it is a main function of the veins. The biggest pulmonary veins are the 4 primary pulmonary veins, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary blood circulation. The most essential function of the pulmonary veins is to bring oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, which is then pumped outward to the rest of the body. After the blood is reached other parts of the body through arteries, it loses oxygen and develops into deoxygenated blood. The body can not live and grow without oxygen; hence the pulmonary veins are of terrific significance in this field. They hold the secret to appropriate functioning of the circulatory and cardiovascular system. As part of the pulmonary blood circulation they carry oxygenated blood back to the heart, rather than the veins of the systemic blood circulation which bring deoxygenated blood. An uncommon genetic defect of the pulmonary veins can cause them to drain into the pulmonary blood circulation in entire or in part, this is referred to as a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, or partial anomalous pulmonary connection, respectively. Two primary pulmonary veins emerge from each lung hilum, getting blood from three or four bronchial veins each and draining into the left atrium. An inferior and superior mother lode drains each lung, so there are four mother lodes in total. At the root of the lung, the right remarkable pulmonary vein depends on front of and a little below the pulmonary artery; the inferior is positioned at the lowest part of the lung hilum. Behind the pulmonary artery is the bronchus. The right main pulmonary veins (includes oxygenated blood) pass behind the right atrium and superior vena cava; the left in front of the coming down thoracic aorta. Sometimes the 3 lobar veins on the right side remain separate, and not rarely the two left lobar veins end by a typical opening into the left atrium. Therefore, the variety of pulmonary veins opening into the left atrium can differ between 3 and five in the healthy population. The two left lobar veins might be unified as a single pulmonary vein in about 25% of people; the two right veins may be united in about 3%.

The term ""vein"" has diverse meanings in other contexts. In botany, vein refers to the vascular tissue of leaves, located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll, that forms a branching framework of supporting and connecting tissue. The pattern of the veins is called venation. In zoology, veins are a supporting structure in an insect wing. In geology, a vein is a finite volume within a rock, having a distinct shape, filled with crystals of one or more minerals. This article will be limited to the use of the term with reference to the circulatory system. The venal system is the lower-pressure—and normally lower oxygen-carrying—portion of the circulatory system. In the post-fetal human body, with the exception of the pulmonary vein, low oxygen blood moves from the capillaries of the arterial system to small, threadlike veins known as venules, which drain blood directly from the capillary beds, and from these the blood moves to larger and larger veins until back to the heart. The arteries are perceived as carrying oxygenated blood to the tissues, while veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This is true of the systemic circulation, by far the larger of the two circuits of blood in the body, which transports oxygen from the heart to the tissues of the body. In pulmonary circulation, however, the arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The difference between veins and arteries is their direction of flow (out of the heart by arteries, returning to the heart for veins), not their oxygen content. In addition, deoxygenated blood that is carried from the tissues back to the heart for reoxygenation in systemic circulation still carries some oxygen, though it is considerably less than that carried by the systemic arteries or pulmonary veins. Like the arteries, the veins are defined by their three-layer walls, but the vein walls are less muscular and thinner than the artery walls. Skeletal muscle contractions help move the blood through the veins. The interiors of the larger veins are occupied by periodically occurring one-way flaps called venous valves, which prevent blood from flowing backward and from pooling in the lower extremities due to the effects of gravity. In humans, valves are absent in the smallest veins and most numerous in the extremities. Excepting the pulmonary vein, veins function to return deoxygenated blood to the heart and are essentially tubes that collapse when their lumens are not filled with blood. The thick, outer-most layer of a vein is made of collagen, wrapped in bands of smooth muscle while the interior is lined with endothelial cells called intima. The precise location of veins is much more variable from person to person than that of arteries. The total capacity of the veins in humans is more than sufficient to hold the entire blood volume of the body. This capacity is reduced through the venous tone of the smooth muscles, minimizing the cross-sectional area (and hence volume) of the individual veins and therefore total venous system. The helical bands of smooth muscles that wrap around veins help maintain blood flow to the right atrium. In cases of vasovagal syncope, the most common type of fainting, the smooth muscles relax and the veins of the extremities below the heart fill up with blood, failing to return sufficient volume to maintain cardiac output and blood flow to the brain. Veins return blood from organs to the heart. In systemic circulation in human beings, oxygenated blood is pumped by the left ventricle through the arteries to the muscles and organs of the body, where nutrients and oxygen in the blood are exchanged at capillaries for cellular wastes carbon dioxide. The deoxygenated and waste-laden blood flows through the veins to the right atrium of the heart, which transfers the blood to the right ventricle, from where it is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. In pulmonary circulation the pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium, which empties into the left ventricle, completing the cycle of blood circulation. (The cellular wastes are removed primarily by the kidneys.) The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the skeletal-muscle pump, which helps maintain the extremely low blood pressure of the venous system. Fainting can be caused by failure of the skeletal-muscular pump. Long periods of standing can result in blood pooling in the legs, with blood pressure too low to return blood to the heart. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. In a functional analogy, the term ""venous"" in economics refers to recycling industries, in contrast to ""arterial"" or production industries. Veins are used medically as points of access to the blood stream, permitting the withdrawal of blood specimens (venipuncture) for testing purposes, and intravenous delivery of fluid, electrolytes, nutrition, and medications through injection with a syringe, or by inserting a catheter. In contrast to arterial blood, which is uniform throughout the body, the blood removed from veins for testing can vary in its contents depending on the part of the body the vein drains; blood drained from a working muscle will contain significantly less oxygen and glucose than blood drained from the liver. However, the more blood from different veins mixes as it returns to the heart, the more homogeneous it becomes. If an intravenous catheter has to be inserted, for most purposes this is done into a peripheral vein near the surface of the skin in the hand or arm, or less desirably, the leg. Some highly concentrated fluids or irritating medications must flow into the large central veins, which are sometimes used when peripheral access cannot be obtained. Catheters can be threaded into the superior vena cava for these uses: if long term use is thought to be needed, a more permanent access point can be inserted surgically. The most common vein disorder is venous insufficiency, usually manifested by spider veins or varicose veins. A variety of treatments are used depending on the patient's particular type and pattern of veins and on the physician's preferences. Treatment can include radio-frequency ablation, vein stripping, ambulatory phlebectomy, foam sclerotherapy, lasers, or compression. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency. Phlebology is the medical discipline that involves the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of venous origin. Diagnostic techniques used include the history and physical examination, venous imaging techniques, and laboratory evaluation related to venous thromboembolism. The American Medical Association has added phlebology to its list of Self-Designated Practice Specialties. The American College of Phlebology is a professional organization of physicians and health care professionals from a variety of backgrounds. Annual meetings are conducted to facilitate learning and sharing of knowledge regarding venous disease. The equivalent body for countries in the Pacific is the Australasian College of Phlebology, active in Australia and New Zealand. The Great Saphenous vein (GSV) is the most important superficial vein of the lower limb of humans. First described by the Persian physician Avicenna, Saphenous derives its name from Safina, meaning hidden. This vein is ""hidden"" in its own fascial compartment in the thigh and only exits the fascia near the knee. Incompetence of this vein is an important cause of varicose veins of lower limbs. The pulmonary veins carry relatively oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The superior and inferior venae cavae carry relatively deoxygenated blood from the upper and lower systemic circulations, respectively. A portal venous system is a series of veins or venules that directly connect two capillary beds. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal vein and hypophyseal portal system.

who were the parties to the atlantic charter in 1941 what were their eight common principles,"The Atlantic Charter was a pivotal policy statement issued during World War II on 14 August 1941, which defined the Allied goals for the postwar world. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted the work and all the Allies of World War II later confirmed it. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war -- no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, self-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, which became the basis for the modern United Nations.","War leads to the erosion of liberty for the benefit of the military-industrial complex.  World War II set in motion the destruction of privacy and the formation of an Orwellian Police State controlled by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of America.  Under the guise of cooperation and mutual respect, countries signed secret agreements with the NSA to share signals intelligence (SIGINT) which in layman’s terms means your phone calls, instant messages, and more.  [1] Shortly after World War II, the United States and its allies built the ECHELON system to spy on land and satellite-based communications worldwide. [2] Their closest allies, dubbed The Five Eyes (FVEY), received privileged treatment from the NSA community wherein these five countries share resources on a grand scale. [3] The Five Eyes are also know as AUSCANNZUKUS, short for AUStralia, CANada, New Zealand, UK, and US.   As time progressed the Five Eyes added two more tiers to their club: the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes.  The Fourteen Eyes are officially known as SIGINT Seniors Europe, or “SSEUR” but I think we can unofficially call them: The New World Order. This Anglosphere-based NWO group is now hell-bent on a United Nations based one-world government, with a single digital currency worldwide, and a completely disarmed populace. [4] The recent Snowden-disclosures should be enough to wake the people, however informal gas station polls show that Average Joe has no clue. Each member of The Fourteen Eyes of the New World Order is subservient to the Five Eyes, and all other nations are enemies of the one-world government.  To see this any other way is to have eyes and yet be blind. The Fourteen Eyes use their combined technocratic might to infiltrate, subjugate, and excommunicate all who oppose their political or financial agendas.  The Five Eyes use their illuminated status to enslave the Nine side-kicks, as was the case during the Wikileaks disclosure of the US. government pushing Monsanto GMO corn into Paris, a Nine Eyes member.  The US. State department also used their NSA and 14 Eyes to spy on anti-GMO activists in Paris, and “calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits.” Occupy Wall Street suffered a similar fate. [5]  Through a combined lame-stream propaganda campaign and targeted domestic spying by the Department of Homeland Security, the will of the people was mocked, shunned, and silenced.  The Fourteen Eyes form a freedom-slaying Voltron that is worse than Orwell’s nightmares and what Willis was talkin’ about. The Fourteen Eyes feed a brain in Nevada at the Utah Data Center.  The NSA uses this massive database to silence activists, silence Congressmen, and even silence Generals. Still the question remains, who controls the NSA? How can any progress toward less government, less war, free energy, more freedom, and common abundance ever occur when globalist ideologies and Big Brother are hell-bent on destroying our borders, taking our guns, and ensuring nothing you do can stop our progress towards a one-world government.  The Fourteen Eyes will have their New World Order so don’t protest, buy the GMO corn, and go shopping, stay scared! Britain’s GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That’s how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles. The documents show that, in this situation, the services did what is not only obvious, but also anchored in German law: They exchanged information. And they worked together extensively. That applies to the British and the Americans, but also to the BND, which assists the NSA in its Internet surveillance. [53] According to previously unpublished material from a bail hearing, Delisle walked into the embassy wearing a red ball cap and civilian clothes. He flashed his Canadian military identification and asked to meet with someone from GRU, the Russian military intelligence. Delisle was posted to the security unit HMCS Trinity, an intelligence facility at the naval dockyard in Halifax. It tracks vessels entering and exiting Canadian waters via satellites, drones and underwater devices. While there he worked on a system called the Stone Ghost, said CBC reporter Rob Gordon. “It’s a computer system that links the five eyes. The five eyes are the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. All their information is shared on the Stone Ghost computer. “He would go to work every time with a thumb drive and download reams of information, which he would then send to the Russians on a monthly basis. This went on for years and years and years.” He was paid between $2,800 and $3,000 a month for the information. In 2009, when Delisle wanted to stop dealing with the Russians, they sent him a picture of his daughter walking to school in Halifax. [6][7] The National Security Agency routinely shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about US citizens, a top-secret document [8] provided to the Guardian by whistle-blower Edward Snowden reveals. Details of the intelligence-sharing agreement are laid out in a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart that shows the US government handed over intercepted communications likely to contain phone calls and emails of American citizens. The agreement places no legally binding limits on the use of the data by the Israelis. [9] Some foreign (and domestic —Ed.) observers regard any U.S. surveillance efforts with suspicion, fearing that intelligence products will be used against their national interests, the privacy rights of their citizens, or to advance the interests of U.S. firms in competition for international business. This view is held even though it is well-known that many countries have long undertaken similar efforts. Nonetheless, some argue that electronic surveillance, except in a narrow, court-approved, law enforcement context, should not be undertaken by democratic governments. [2] HBGary Federal, a US defense department cyber security firm, was hacked (allegedly by a 16 year old girl) and its emails were uploaded to torrents and websites. In those emails, the public learned that prominent law firms hired Berico Technologies, Palantir Technologies, and HBGary to create fake Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts to post online as if they were real people and influence your opinion. [10][11][12][13] One person can run more than 50 different accounts, all with complete “online” life histories to add authenticity. Their purpose? Discredit all associated with Wikileaks through coercion and convince the public that Wikileaks, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Assange are terrorists. The U.S. government uses StoneGhost, the United States SIGINT System (USSS), [14] and Fourteen Eyes mass surveillance to attack, harass, and intimidate citizens on behalf of U.S. based corporate interests. Moratoriums on Monsanto’s famous “MON 810” genetically modified (GMO) corn are being passed all across Europe due to people’s belief that these products are unsafe. Instead of respecting the people’s will, our state department considers making a “target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU” to help out their struggling buddies at Monsanto. 4. (C) France’s new “High Authority” on agricultural biotech is designed to roll back established science-based decision making. The recently formed authority is divided into two colleges, a scientific college and a second group including civil society and social scientists to assess the “common interest” of France. The authority’s first task is to review MON 810. In the meantime, however, the draft biotech law submitted to the National Assembly and the Senate for urgent consideration, could make any biotech planting impossible in practical terms. The law would make farmers and seed companies legally liable for pollen drift and sets the stage for inordinately large cropping distances. The publication of a registry identifying cultivation of GMOs at the parcel level may be the most significant measure given the propensity for activists to destroy GMO crops in the field. 5. (C) Both the GOF and the Commission have suggested that their respective actions should not alarm us since they are only cultivation rather than import bans. We see the cultivation ban as a first step, at least by anti-GMO advocates, who will move next to ban or further restrict imports. (The environment minister’s top aide told us that people have a right not to buy meat raised on biotech feed, even though she acknowledged there was no possible scientific basis for a feed based distinction.) Further, we should not be prepared to cede on cultivation because of our considerable planting seed business in Europe and because farmers, once they have had experience with biotech, become its staunchest supporters. 6. Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits. The list should be measured rather than vicious and must be sustainable over the long term, since we should not expect an early victory. [15] Let it be known: if you are an anti-GMO activist living in the United States of America or abroad, the full might of the Fourteen Eyes, the NSA, and the StoneGhost surveillance machine will bear down on you in defense of Monsanto.  How many more companies are on the “cool kids” list? “The common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality.”  Former CFR board member Walter Lippman, Public Opinion(1922) “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” “… once having joined the One-World Federated Government, no nation could secede or revolt … because with the Atom Bomb in its possession the Federal Government [of the World] would blow that nation off the face of the earth.” ” We must haul down the American flag … haul it down, stamp on it, spit on it. “ This organization was founded in Asheville, North Carolina as the result of a merger of five existing world government groups: American United for World Government; World Federalists, U.S.A.; Student Federalists; Georgia World Citizens Committee; and the Massachusetts Committee for World Federation. The United World Federalists is a non-partisan, non-profit organization with members in forty-eight states. It has 350 chapters in thirty-nine states and one chapter in Hawaii. State branches exist in twenty-seven states. The primary purpose of the organization is: Membership is open to any American except persons Communist or Fascist oriented. “We shall have world government whether or not you like it – by conquest or consent.” “Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.” TLB recommends at visit to ClimateViewer News for more pertinent information.

World War II was a total war; homeland production became even more invaluable to both the Allied and Axis powers. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree. All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences good and bad on the home front during World War I. Their success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. Among morale-boosting activities that also benefited combat efforts, the home front engaged in a variety of scrap drives for materials crucial to the war effort such as metal, rubber, and rags. The major powers devoted 50–61 percent of their total GDP to munitions production. The Allies produced about three times as much in munitions as the Axis powers. Source: Goldsmith data in Harrison (1988) p. 172 The Allies called themselves the ""United Nations"" (even before that organization formed in 1945), and pledged their support to the Atlantic Charter of 1941. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; free access to raw materials; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as the disarmament of aggressor nations. The sudden German invasion of neutral Belgium in May 1940 led in a matter of 18 days to the collapse of the Belgian army; King Leopold obtained an armistice that involved direct German military administration. The King refused the demand of the government that he flee with them to Britain; he remained as a puppet ruler under German control. The Belgian bureaucracy remained in place and generally cooperated with the German rulers. Two pro-German movements, the Flemish National Union comprising Flemish (Dutch-speaking ) separatists and the Walloon (French-speaking ) Rexists led by Léon Degrelle (1906–94)  supported the invaders and encouraged their young men to volunteer for the German army.[1] Small but active resistance movements, largely Communist, provided intelligence to the Allies. During the Holocaust in Belgium, the Nazis hunted down the 70,000 Jews living in Belgium, most of them refugees, and killed 29,000 of them.[2] The Germans expected to exploit Belgium's industrial resources to support their war machine. Their policies created severe shortages for the Belgian people, but shipped out far less than Germany had expected. They set up the ""Armaments Inspection Board"" in 1940 to relay munitions orders to factories; the Board came under the control of the German Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer in 1943, and had offices in industrial areas that were supposed to facilitate orders for materiél, and supervise production. However, factory production fell sharply after 1942. Although collaboration with the Nazis, especially among the Flemish, was evident in 1940, it soon faded in importance. Labor strikes and systematic sabotage slowed production, as did the emigration of workers to rural areas, Allied bombing, food shortages, and worker resentment to forced labor.[3] The Allies retook all of Belgium in September 1944 as the Germans retreated. They reappeared briefly during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, but were finally expelled in January 1945. The London‐based government‐in‐exile returned, but had to confront the resistance movements that demanded radical political change.[4] China suffered the second highest number of casualties of the entire war. Civilians in the occupied territories had to endure many large-scale massacres, including that in Nanking. In a few areas, Japanese forces also unleashed newly developed biological weapons on Chinese civilians leading to an estimated 200,000 dead.[5] Tens of thousands died when Nationalist troops broke the levees of the Yangtze to stop the Japanese advance after the loss of the Chinese capital, Nanjing. Millions more Chinese died because of famine during the war. Japan captured major coastal cities like Shanghai early in the war; cutting the rest of China off from its chief sources of finance and industry. Millions of Chinese moved to remote regions to avoid invasion. Cities like Kunming ballooned with new arrivals. Entire factories and universities were often taken along so the society could still function. Japan replied with hundreds of air raids on the new capital of Chongqing. Although China received much aid from the United States, China did not have sufficient infrastructure to properly arm or even feed its military forces, let alone its civilians. China was divided into three zones, with the Nationalists in the southwest and the Communists led by Mao Zedong (Mao) in control of much of the northwest. Coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese and civilians were treated harshly; young men were drafted into a puppet Chinese army. After the stunningly quick victory in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war and part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country.[6] The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them in prisoner of war camps inside Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. The Vichy French government, cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.[7][8] The two million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families.[9] Meanwhile, the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles.[10] After the war, France gave women the vote and additional legal and political rights, although nothing on the scale of the enfranchisement that followed World War I. Women suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods and the absence of the men in POW camps.[11] The rationing system was stringent and badly mismanaged, leading to pronounced malnourishment, black markets and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about 20% of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people.[12] French farm production fell by half because of the lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so, the Germans seized half the meat and 20% of the produce.[13] Supply problems quickly affected French stores, which lacked most items. The government responded by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting young people in urban areas. At shops, the queues lengthened. Some people—including German soldiers who could take advantage of arbitrary exchange rates that favored Germany—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without coupons at very high prices. Farmers diverted meat to the black market, which meant that there was much less for the open market. Counterfeit food coupons were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. Vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition were prevalent.[14] Advice about eating a healthier diet and home growing produce was distributed. Slogans like 'Digging for Victory' and 'Make Do and Mend' appeared on national posters and became a part of the war effort. The city environment made these efforts nearly negligible.[15] In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted survival. The official ration provided starvation-level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day (5400 kJ), supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.[16] The Dutch famine of 1944, known as the Hongerwinter (""Hunger winter"") was a man-made famine imposed by Germany in the occupied western provinces during the winter of 1944–1945. A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm areas. A total of 4.5 million people were affected, of whom 18,000 died, despite an elaborate system of emergency soup kitchens.[17] The Nazi Hunger Plan was to kill the Jews of Poland quickly, and slowly to force the Poles to leave by threat of starvation, so that they could be replaced by German settlers. The Nazis coerced Poles to work in Germany by providing favorable food rations for families who had members working in the Reich. The ethnic German population in Poland (Volksdeutsche) were given good rations and were allowed to shop for food in special stores. The German occupiers created a draconian system of food controls, including severe penalties for the omnipresent black market. There was a sharp increase in mortality due to the general malnutrition, and a decline in birth rates.[18][19][20][21] By mid 1941, the German minority in Poland received 2,613 calories (11,000 kJ) per day, while Poles received 699 and Jews in the ghetto 184.[22] The Jewish ration fulfilled just 7.5% of their daily needs; Polish rations only 26%. Only the ration allocated to Germans provided the full required calorie intake.[23] Additionally the Generalplan Ost of the Nazis, which envisioned the elimination of the Slavic population in the occupied territories and artificial famines-as proposed in the Hunger Plan, were to be used. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, conquering it in three weeks, as the Soviets invaded the eastern areas. During the German occupation, there were two distinct civilian uprisings in Warsaw, one in 1943, the other in 1944. The first took place in an entity, less than two square miles (5 km2) in area, which the Germans had carved out of the city and called Ghetto Warschau. The Germans built high walls around the ghetto, and crowded 550,000 Polish Jews into it, many from the Polish provinces. At first, people were allowed to enter and leave the ghetto, but soon its border became an ""iron curtain"". Unless on official business, Jews could not leave, and non-Jews, including Germans, could not enter. Entry points were guarded by German soldiers. Because of extreme conditions and hunger, mortality in the ghetto was high. In 1942, the Germans moved 400,000 ghetto residents to Treblinka where they were gassed on arrival. By April 19, 1943, when the Ghetto Uprising commenced, the population of the ghetto had dwindled to 60,000 individuals. In the following three weeks, virtually all died as the Germans fought and systematically destroyed the buildings in the ghetto.[25] The uprising by Poles began on August 1, 1944, when the Polish underground, the ""Home Army"", aware that the Soviet Army had reached the eastern bank of the Vistula, sought to liberate Warsaw much as the French resistance had liberated Paris a few weeks earlier. Joseph Stalin had his own group of Communist leaders for the new Poland and did not want the Home Army or its leaders (based in London) to control Warsaw. So he halted the Soviet offensive and gave the Germans free rein to suppress it. During the ensuing 63 days, 250,000 Poles of the Home Army surrendered to the Germans. After the Germans forced all the surviving population to leave the city, Hitler ordered that any buildings left standing be dynamited – 98 percent of the buildings in Warsaw were destroyed.[26] During the invasion of the Soviet Union in the early months of the war, rapid German advances almost captured the cities of Moscow and Leningrad. The bulk of Soviet industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain crops left standing in the fields  This caused hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1,523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Ural, and Siberia.[27] In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labor. The whole of the Soviet Union become dedicated to the war effort. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food.[28] Conditions were nevertheless severe. World War II was especially devastating to citizens of the USSR because it was fought on Soviet territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over a million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and old people. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Off-ration food was often so expensive that it could not add substantially to a citizen's food supply unless they were especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with any local resources they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold their surplus food at a high price; a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.[29] Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied to protect their Motherland against the evils of the German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of a Communist Party propaganda campaign to mobilize religious people. Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war, and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honors and money benefits if they had several children—mothers could earn around 1,300 rubles for having their fourth child and up to 5,000 rubles for their tenth.[30] The city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during World War II. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege, which lasted from September 1941 until January 1944. Many people lost weight, and grew weaker and more vulnerable to disease. If malnutrition persisted for long enough, its effects were irreversible. People's feelings of loyalty disappeared if they got hungry enough; they would steal from their closest family members in order to survive.[31] Only some of the citizens of Leningrad survived. Only 400,000 were evacuated before the siege began; this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. Subsequently, more managed to escape; especially when the nearby Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or ""road of life""—to safety.[32] Those in influential political or social positions used their connections to other elites to leave Leningrad both before and after the siege began. Some factory owners even looted state funds to secure transport out of the city during the first summer of the war.[33] The most risky means of escape, however, was to defect to the enemy and hope to avoid governmental punishment. Most survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck: for instance by securing factory employment, because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the requirements for survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers received larger rations than other civilians, and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced vital goods. Factories also served as mutual support centers, and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horsemeat in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.[34] Survival opportunities open to the wider Soviet community included barter and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with civilians who had extra warm clothes to exchange. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens could keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.[35] Many of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime to support themselves. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards; this could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes such as murder and cannibalism also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.[36] In the United States, farming and other production was increased. For example, citizens were encouraged to plant ""victory gardens"", personal farms that children sometimes worked on.[37] Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the ""home"" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the ""home front""; meanwhile the public sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of military action.[38] The Philippines was an American possession on the way to independence (scheduled in 1946) and controlled its own internal affairs. The Japanese invaded and quickly conquered the islands in early 1942. The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the Philippine Executive Commission. They initially organized a Council of State, through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic headed by President José P. Laurel proved to be ineffective and unpopular as Japan maintained very tight controls.[39] Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war. They formed an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon.[40] The Americans invaded in 1944–45; the battle for Manila was contested street by street with large numbers of civilians killed. As in most occupied countries, crime, looting, corruption, and black markets were endemic.[41] With a view of building up the economic base of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they try to grow cotton in on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flock to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs. The Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, derris for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and abaca (hemp) for rope. The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program was a failure that gave very little help to Japanese industry, and diverted resources needed for food production.[42] As Karnow reports, Filipinos ""rapidly learned as well that 'co-prosperity' meant servitude to Japan's economic requirements."" [43] Living conditions were bad throughout the Philippines during the war. Transportation between the islands was difficult because of lack of fuel. Food was in very short supply, with sporadic famines and epidemic diseases[44][45] The Japanese tried to remove all Western and American cultural influences. They met fierce resistance when they tried to undermine the Catholic Church by arresting 500 Christian missionaries. The Filipinos came to feel morally superior to the brutal Japanese and rejected their advances.[46] Newspapers and the media were tightly censored. The Japanese tried to reshape schools and impose the Japanese language. They formed neighborhood associations to inform on the opposition.[47] Britain's total mobilization during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a ""people's war"" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.[48][49] Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.[50] Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.[51] The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control.[52] In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals, and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasized, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labor force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.[53] Parents had much less time to supervise their children, and there were fears of juvenile delinquency, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all young people over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organizations available to them.[54] In mid-1940, the RAF (Royal Air Force) was called on to fight the Battle of Britain but it had suffered serious losses. It lost 458 aircraft—more than current production—in France and was hard pressed. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They were: Wellingtons, Whitley Vs, Blenheims, Hurricanes and Spitfires. These aircraft received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labor was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.[55] Starting in 1941, the US provided munitions through Lend lease that totaled $15.5 billion[56] Food, clothing, petrol, leather and other items were rationed. However, items such as sweets and fruits were not rationed, as they would spoil. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew ""victory gardens"", and small home vegetable gardens. Many things were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for nitroglycerin production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally-sourced unrationed products than people in cities, and were more able to grow their own. The rationing system, which had been originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government's imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal ""national loaf"". Surveys of public opinion showed that most Britons were pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.[58] From very early in the war, it was thought that the major industrial cities of Britain, especially London, would come under Luftwaffe air attack; this did happen with The Blitz. Some children were sent to Canada, the USA and Australia and millions of children and some mothers were evacuated from London and other major cities to safer parts of the country when the war began, under government plans for the evacuation of civilians, but they often filtered back. When the Blitz bombing began on September 6, 1940, they evacuated again. The discovery of the poor health and hygiene of evacuees was a shock to many Britons, and helped prepare the way for the Beveridge Report. Children were evacuated if their parents agreed; but in some cases they had no choice. The children were only allowed to take a few things with them, including a gas mask, books, money, clothes, ration book and some small toys.[59][60] Belfast in Northern Ireland was a representative British city that has been well studied by historians.[61][62] It was a key industrial city producing ships, tanks, aircraft, engineering works, arms, uniforms, parachutes and a host of other industrial goods. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.[63] As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city for example. The Northern Ireland government under Richard Dawson Bates (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was too distant. When Germany conquered France in spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After seeing the Blitz in London in the autumn of 1940, the government began the construction of air raid shelters. The Luftwaffe in early 1941, flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Especially hard hit were the working class areas in the north and east of the city where over a thousand were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city afraid of future attacks. The bombing revealed the terrible slum conditions. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. Apart from the numbers of dead, the Belfast blitz saw half of the city's houses destroyed. Approximately twenty million pounds worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticized heavily for its lack of preparation. The criticism forced the resignation of Northern Ireland's Prime Minister J. M. Andrews. The bombing raids continued until the invasion of Russia in the summer of 1941. The American army arrived in 1942–44, setting up bases around Northern Ireland, and spending freely. An Emergency Hospital Service was established at the beginning of the war, in the expectation that it would be required to deal with large numbers of casualties. A common theme called for an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices [64] The goal was operationalized in a famous report by William Beveridge  It recommended that the various income maintenance services that a grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.[65] The themes of equality and sacrifice were dominant during the war, and in the memory of the war. Harris points out that the war was seen at the time and by a generation of writers as a period of outstanding national unity and social solidarity. There was little antiwar sentiment during or after the war. Furthermore, Britain turned more toward the collective welfare state during the war, expanding it in the late 1940s and reaching a broad consensus supporting it across party lines. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, historians were exploring the subtle elements of continuing diversity and conflict in  society during the war period.[66] For example, at first historians emphasized that strikes became illegal in July 1940, and no trade union called one during the war. Later historians pointed to the many localized unofficial strikes, especially in coal mining, shipbuilding, the metal trades, and engineering, with as many as 3.7 million man days lost in 1944.[67] The BBC collected 47,000 wartime recollections and 15,000 images in 2003-6 and put them online.[68] The CD audiobook Home Front 1939–45 also contains a selection of period interviews and actuality recordings.[69] Canada joined the war effort on September 10, 1939; the government deliberately waited after Britain's decision to go to war, partly to demonstrate its independence from Britain and partly to give the country extra time to import arms from the United States as a non-belligerent.[70] War production was ramped up quickly, and was centrally managed through the Department of Munitions and Supply. Unemployment faded away. Canada became one of the largest trainers of pilots for the Allies through the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Many Canadian men joined the war effort, so with them overseas and industries pushing to increase production, women took up positions to aid in the war effort. The hiring of men in many positions in civilian employment was effectively banned later in the war through measures taken under the National Resources Mobilization Act.. Shipyards and repair facilities expanded dramatically as over a thousand warships and cargo vessels were built, along with thousands of auxiliary craft, small boats and others.[71] Canada expanded food production, but shipped so much to Britain that food rationing had to be imposed. In 1942 it shipped to Britain 25 per cent of total meat production (including 75% of the bacon), 65% of the cheese and 13% of the eggs.[72] Since 20% of Canada's population were not of British or French origin, their status was of special concern. The main goal was to integrate the marginalized European ethnicities—as opposed to the First World War policy of internment camps for Ukrainians and Germans. In the case of Germany, Italy and especially Japan, the government watched the ethnics closely for signs of loyalty to their homelands. The fears proved groundless.[73] In February 1942 21,000 Japanese Canadians were rounded up and sent to internment camps that closely resembled similar camps in the US because the two governments had agreed in 1941 to coordinate their evacuation policies.[74] Most had lived in British Columbia, but in 1945 they were released from detention and allowed to move anywhere in Canada except British Columbia, or they could go to Japan. Most went to the Toronto area.[75][76] Canadian women responded to urgent appeals to make-do, recycle and salvage in order to come up with needed supplies. They saved fats and grease; gathered recycled goods, handed out information on the best methods to use that one may get the most out of recycled goods and organized many other events to decrease the amount of waste. Volunteer organizations led by women also prepared packages for the military overseas or for prisoners of war in Axis countries. With World War II came the dire need for employees in the workplace, without women to step-in, the economy would have collapsed. By autumn 1944 the number of women working full-time in Canada's paid labor force was twice what it had been in 1939, and that figure of between 1,000,000 and 1,200,000 did not include part-time workers or women working on farms.""[77] Women had to take on this intensive labor and while they did this they still had to find time to make jam, clothes and other such acts of volunteering to aid the men overseas. The government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Australian and American armed forces. There were a few Japanese attacks, most notably on Darwin in February 1942, along with the widespread fear in 1942, that Australia would be invaded. Australia entered the war in 1939 and sent its forces to fight the Germans in the Middle East (where they were successful) and Singapore (where they were captured by the Japanese in 1942). By 1943, 37% of the Australian GDP was directed at the war effort. Total war expenditure came to £2,949 million between 1939 and 1945.[78] The Curtin Labor Government took over in October 1941, and energized the war effort, with rationing of scarce fuel, clothing and some food. When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the danger was at hand, and all women and children were evacuated from Darwin and northern Australia. The Commonwealth Government took control of all income taxation in 1942, which gave it extensive new powers and greatly reduced the states' financial autonomy.[79] Manufacturing grew rapidly, with the assembly of high performance guns and aircraft a specialty. The number of women working in factories rose from 171,000 to 286,000.[80] The arrival of tens of thousands of Americans was greeted with relief, as they could protect Australia where Britain could not. The US sent in $1.1 billion in Lend Lease, and Australia returned about the same total in services, food, rents and supplies to the Americans.[81] New Zealand, with a population of 1.7 million, including 99,000 Maori, was highly mobilized during the war. The Labour party was in power and promoted unionization and the welfare state. The armed forces peaked at 157,000 in September 1942; 135,000 served abroad, and 10,100 died. Agriculture expanded, sending record supplies of meat, butter and wool to Britain. When American forces arrived, they were fed as well. The nation spent £574 million on the wear, of which 43% came from taxes, 41% from loans and  16% from American Lend Lease. It was an era of prosperity as the national income soared from £158 million in 1937 to £292 million in 1944. Rationing and price controls kept inflation to only 14% during 1939–45.[82][83] Montgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women, especially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional female jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and reversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and many women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change in gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since the 1920s.[84][85] During World War II, India was a colony of Britain known as British Raj. Britain declared war on behalf of India without consulting with Indian leaders.[86] This resulted in resignation of Congress Ministries.[87] The British recruited some 2.5 million Indian volunteers, who played major roles as soldiers in the Middle East, North Africa, and Burma in the British Indian Army. India became the main base for British operations against Japan, and for American efforts to support China. In Bengal, with an elected Muslim local government under British supervision, the cutoff of rice imports from Burma led to severe food shortages, made worse by maladministration. Prices soared and millions starved because they could not buy food. In the Bengal famine of 1943, three million people died.[88] A small anti-British force of about 40,000 men (and a few women) formed in Southeast Asia, the Indian National Army (INA) under Subhas Chandra Bose. It was under Japanese army control and performed poorly in combat. Its members were captured Indian soldiers from British Indian Army who gained release from extreme conditions in POW camps by joining the Japanese-sponsored INA. It participated in Battle Of Kohima and Battle of Imphal. In postwar Indian politics, some Indians called them heroes. The Congress Party in 1942 demanded immediate independence, which Britain rejected. Congress then demanded the British immediately ""Quit India"" in August 1942, but the Raj responded by immediately jailing tens of thousands of national, state and regional leaders; knocking Congress out of the war. Meanwhile, the Muslim League supported the war effort and gained prestige and membership, as well as British support for its demands for a separate Muslim state (which became Pakistan in 1947). Hong Kong was a British colony captured by Japan on December 25, 1941, after 18 days of fierce fighting. The conquest was swift, but was followed by days of large-scale looting; over ten thousand Chinese women were raped or gang-raped by the Japanese soldiers.[89] The population halved, from 1.6 million in 1941 to 750,000 at war's end because of fleeing refugees; they returned in 1945.[90] The Japanese imprisoned the ruling British colonial elite and sought to win over the local merchant gentry by appointments to advisory councils and neighborhood watch groups. The policy worked well for Japan and produced extensive collaboration from both the elite and the middle class, with far less terror than in other Chinese cities. Hong Kong was transformed into a Japanese colony, with Japanese businesses replacing the British. However, the Japanese Empire had severe logistical difficulties and by 1943 the food supply for Hong Kong was problematic. The overlords became more brutal and corrupt, and the Chinese gentry became disenchanted. With the surrender of Japan the transition back to British rule was smooth, for on the mainland the Nationalist and Communists forces were preparing for a civil war and ignored Hong Kong. In the long run the occupation strengthened the pre-war social and economic order among the Chinese business community by eliminating some conflicts of interests and reducing the prestige and power of the British.[91] Germany had not fully mobilized in 1939, nor even in 1941. Not until 1943, under Albert Speer (the minister of armaments in the Reich), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production. Instead of using all available Germans, it brought in millions of foreign workers from conquered countries, treating them badly (and getting low productivity in return).[92] Germany's economy was simply too small for a longer all-out war. Hitler's strategy was to change this by a series of surprise blitzkriegs. This failed with defeats in Russia in 1941 and 1942, and against the economic power of the allies.[93] Instead of expanding the economies of the occupied nations, the Nazis seized the portable machinery and rail cars, requisitioned most of their industrial output, took large quantities of food (15% of French output), and forced the victims to pay for their military occupation.[94] The Nazis forced 15 million people to work in Germany (including POWs); many died from bad living conditions, mistreatment, malnutrition, and executions. At its peak, forced laborers comprised 20% of the German work force and were a vital part of the German economic exploitation of the conquered territories. They were especially concentrated in munitions and agriculture.[95] For example, 1.5 million French soldiers were kept in POW camps in Germany as hostages and forced workers and, in 1943, 600,000 French civilians were forced to move to Germany to work in war plants.[96] Although Germany had about double the population of Britain (80 million versus 40 million), it had to use far more labor to provide food and energy. Britain imported food and employed only a million people (5% of the labour force) on farms, while Germany used 11 million (27%). For Germany to build its twelve synthetic oil plants with a capacity of 3.3 million tons a year required 2.4 million tons of structural steel and 7.5 million man-days of labor. (Britain imported all its oil from Iraq, Persia and North America). To overcome this problem, Germany employed millions of forced laborers and POWs; by 1944, they had brought in more than five million civilian workers and nearly two million prisoners of war—a total of 7.13 million foreign workers. Rationing in Germany was introduced in 1939 immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities. Hitler was at first convinced that it would affect public support for the war if a strict rationing program was introduced. The Nazi popularity was in fact partially due to the fact that Germany under the Nazis was relatively prosperous, and Hitler did not want to lose popularity or faith. Hitler felt that food and other shortages had been a major factor in destroying civilian morale during World War I which led to defeatism and surrender. Despite the rationing, civilians had sufficient amounts of food and clothing; witness Howard K. Smith later wrote that ""[f]or a people engaged in a life-and-death war ... the German people for two years of war ate amazingly well."" The meat ration, for example, was 500g per week per person. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, however, this changed to 400g per week, then fell further. Estimating that the meat ration had dropped by up to 80% in five months of fighting in Russia, and citing many other changes in living conditions that suddenly occurred, Smith wrote that by the time he left Germany in late 1941, ""for the first time ... the German people are undernourished"".[97] The system gave extra rations for men involved in heavy industry, and extremely low starvation rations for Jews and Poles in the areas occupied by Germany, but not to the Poles inside Germany many of whom had been brought in to perform heavy labor in German war industries. The amounts available under rationing were sufficient to live from, but clearly did not permit luxuries. Whipped cream became unknown from 1939 until 1948, as well as chocolates, cakes with rich crèmes etc. Meat could not be eaten every day. Other items were not rationed, but simply became unavailable as they had to be imported from overseas: coffee in particular, which throughout was replaced by substitutes made from roasted grains. Vegetables and local fruit were not rationed; imported citrus fruits and bananas were unavailable. In more rural areas, farmers continued to bring their products to the markets, as large cities depended on long distance delivery. Many people kept rabbits for their meat when it became scarce in shops, and it was often a child's job to care for them each day. By the spring of 1945, food distribution and the ration system was increasingly in collapse due to insurmountable transportation disruption and the rapid advance of the Allied armies from west and east with consequent loss of food storage facilities. In Berlin, during the beginning of the Battle of Berlin, the authorities announced the allocation of a special supplementary food ration on April 20, 1945. It consisted of a pound of bacon or sausage, half a pound of rice, half a pound of peas or pulses, a pound of sugar, four ounces of coffee substitute, one ounce of real coffee, and a tin of vegetables or fruit. Additionally, the authorities announced that standard food ration allocations for the next fortnight could be claimed in advance.[99] The extra allocation of rations were dubbed by Berliners Himmelfahrtsrationen, Ascension-day rations, ""Because with these rations we shall now ascend to heaven""[100] Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown nurses, and absorbed one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killing of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.[101] Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male doctors and medics. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.[102] The conquest of Germany in 1945 freed 11 million foreigners, called ""displaced persons"" (DPs)- chiefly forced laborers and POWs. In addition to the POWs, the Germans seized 2.8 million Soviet workers to labor in factories in Germany. Returning them home was a high priority for the Allies. However, in the case of Russians and Ukrainians returning often meant suspicion or prison or even death. The UNRRA, Red Cross and military operations provided food, clothing, shelter and assistance in returning home. In all, 5.2 million were repatriated to the Soviet Union, 1.6 million to Poland, 1.5 million to France, and 900,000 to Italy, along with 300,000 to 400,000 each to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Belgium.[103] In 1944–45, over 2.5 million ethnic Germans fled from Eastern Europe in family groups, desperately hoping to reach Germany before being overtaken by the Russians.[104][105] Half a million died in the process, the survivors were herded into refugee camps in East and West Germany for years. Meanwhile, Moscow encouraged its troops to regard German women as targets for revenge. Russian Marshal Georgi Zhukov called on his troops to, ""Remember our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our wives and children tortured to death by Germans....We shall exact a brutal revenge for everything."" Upwards of two million women inside Germany were raped in 1945 in a tidal wave of looting, burning and vengeance.[106] The Japanese home front was elaborately organized, block by block, with full-scale food rationing and many controls over labor. The government used propaganda heavily and planned in minute detail regarding the mobilization of manpower, identification of critical choke points, food supplies, logistics, air raid shelters, and the evacuation of children and civilians from targeted cities. Food supplies were very tight before the heavy bombing began in fall 1944, then grew to a crisis. There was only a small increase of 1.4 million women entering the labor force between 1940 and 1944. The minister of welfare announced, ""In order to secure its labor force, the enemy is drafting women, but in Japan, out of consideration for the family system, we will not draft them.""[107] The weaknesses in the maximum utilization of womanpower was indicated by the presence of 600,000 domestic servants in wealthy families in 1944. The government wanted to raise the birthrate, even with 8.2 million men in the armed forces, of whom three million were killed. Government incentives helped to raise the marriage rate, but the number of births held steady at about 2.2 million per year, with a 10% decline in 1944–45, and another 15% decline in 1945–46. Strict rationing of milk led to smaller babies. There was little or no long-term impact on the overall demographic profile of Japan.[108] The government began making evacuation plans in late 1943, and started removing entire schools from industrial cities to the countryside, where they were safe from bombing and had better access to food supplies. In all 1.3 million children were moved—with their teachers but not their parents.[109] When the American bombing began in earnest in late 1944, 10 million people fled the cities to the safety of the countryside, including two-thirds of the residents of the largest cities and 87% of the children. Left behind were the munitions workers and government officials. By April 1945, 87% of the younger children had been moved to the countryside. Agricultural production in the home islands  held up well during the war until the bombing started. It fell from an index of 110 in 1942 to 84 in 1944 and only 65 in 1945. Worse, imports dried up.[112] The Japanese food rationing system was effective throughout the war, and there were no serious incidences of malnutrition. A government survey in Tokyo showed that in 1944 families depended on the black market for 9% of their rice, 38% of their fish, and 69% of their vegetables.[113] The Japanese domestic food supply depended, however, on imports, which were largely cut off by the American submarine and bombing campaigns. Likewise there was little deep sea fishing, so that the fish ration by 1941 was mostly squid harvested from coastal waters. The result was a growing food shortage, especially in the cities. There was some malnutrition but no reported starvation.[114]  Despite government rationing of food, some families were forced to spend more than their monthly income could offer on black market food purchases. They would rely on savings or exchange food for clothes or other possessions.[115] The American aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities took from 400,000 to 600,000 civilian lives, with 100,000+ in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The Battle of Okinawa resulted in 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths. In addition civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000. The total of Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war and were caused by starvation or severe malnutrition in garrisons cut off from supplies.[117] Health and living conditions worsened after the surrender in September 1945. Most of the housing stock in large cities was destroyed, just as refugees tried to return from the rural areas. Adding to the crisis there was an influx of 3.5 million returning soldiers and 3.1 million Japanese civilians forcibly repatriated from Imperial outposts in Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines; about 400,000 civilians were left behind and not heard of again. Meanwhile, 1.2 million Koreans, POWs and other non-Japanese left Japan. The government implemented pro-natalist policies, which led to an increase in the marriage rate, but birth rates remained steady until they declined by 10% in the stress of the last year of the war, and another 15% during the hardship of the postwar period.[118] The American bombing campaign of all major cities severely impacted the economy, as did the shortages of oil and raw materials that intensified when Japanese merchant shipping was mostly sunk by American submarines. When industrial production was available to the military, for example, 24 percent of Japan's finished steel in 1937 was allocated to the military, compared to 85 percent in 1945.[119] By the end of the war, output percent of the highest capacity was still 100 percent for steel, although only 75 percent for aluminum, 63 percent for machine tools, 42 percent for vacuum tubes, 54 percent cement, 32 percent cotton fabric, and 36 percent for wool.[120] Severe food shortages were common throughout the war zones, especially in Europe where Germany used starvation as a military weapon. Japan did not use it as a deliberate policy, but the breakdown of its transportation and distribution systems led to famine and starvation conditions among its soldiers on many Pacific islands.[121] Bose (1990) studies the three great Asian famines that took place during the war: Bengal in India, Honan in China, and Tonkin in Vietnam. In each famine at least two million people died. They all occurred in densely populated provinces where the subsistence foundations of agriculture was failing under the weight of demographic and market pressures. In each cases famine played a role in undermining the legitimacy of the state and the preexisting social structure.[122] A great deal of housing was destroyed or largely damaged during the war, especially in the Soviet Union,[123] Germany, and Japan. In Japan, about a third of the families were homeless at the end of the war.[124] In Germany, about 25% of the total housing stock was destroyed or heavily damaged; in the main cities the proportion was about 45%.[125] Elsewhere in Europe, 22% of the prewar housing in Poland was totally destroyed; 21% in Greece; 9% in Austria, 8% in the Netherlands; 8% in France, 7% in Britain, 5% Italy and 4% in Hungary.[126]",,,,,,,,

For most Christians, Sunday is observed as a day of worship and rest, holding it as the Lord's Day and the day of Christ's resurrection. Sunday is a day of rest in most Western countries, part of 'the weekend'. In some Muslim countries and Israel, Sunday is the first work day of the week.  According to the Hebrew calendars and traditional Christian calendars, Sunday is the first day of the week, and according to the International Organization for Standardization ISO 8601 Sunday is the seventh and last day of the week. No century in the Gregorian calendar starts on a Sunday, whether its first year is considered to be '00 or '01. The Jewish New Year never falls on a Sunday. (The rules of the Hebrew calendar are designed such that the first day of Rosh Hashanah will never occur on the first, fourth, or sixth day of the Jewish week; i.e., Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday). Sunday, being the day of the Sun, as the name of the first day of the week, is derived from Hellenistic astrology, where the seven planets, known in English as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, each had an hour of the day assigned to them, and the planet which was regent during the first hour of any day of the week gave its name to that day. During the 1st and 2nd century, the week of seven days was introduced into Rome from Egypt, and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day. The third season of Stargate Atlantis, an American-Canadian television series, began airing on July 21, 2006 on the US-American Sci Fi Channel. The third season concluded after 20 episodes on February 5, 2007 on the Canadian The Movie Network. The series was developed by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, who also served as executive producers. Season three regular cast members include Joe Flanigan, Torri Higginson, Jason Momoa, Rachel Luttrell, Paul McGillion, and David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay. Sunday was an Australian current affairs, arts and politics program, broadcast nationally on Sunday mornings on the Nine Network Australia. The program covered a range of topical issues including local and overseas news, politics, and in-depth stories on Australia and the world, plus independent film reviews, independent arts features, and independent music reviews. Its final show was aired on Sunday, 3 August 2008. The announcement of the launch of the private and independent breakfast television and Canberra-produced politics program on 22 October 1981 inspired controversy, as it was then practice to fill the spot with religious programming. The advent and ongoing success of Sunday was a significant milestone in Australian television, as it for the first time offered a credible alternative/rival to the dominant influence of the ABC's flagship current affairs program Four Corners, which had premiered 20 years earlier. Sunday was often referred to as the ""baby"" of network boss Kerry Packer, although rival media outlets have characterised it as ""an expensive indulgence"".",,,,,,,,
how did the american duties act of 1764 (aka the sugar) act differ from the molasses act of 1733,"The Sugar Act, also known as the American Revenue Act or the American Duties Act, was a revenue-raising act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain on April 5, 1764. The preamble to the act stated: ""it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this Kingdom ... and ... it is just and necessary that a revenue should be raised ... for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same."" The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, which had imposed a tax of six pence per gallon of molasses, had never been effectively collected due to colonial evasion. By reducing the rate by half and increasing measures to enforce the tax, the British hoped that the tax would actually be collected. These incidents increased the colonists' concerns about the intent of the British Parliament and helped the growing movement that became the American Revolution.",,,,,,,,,,

Kelly Overton stars as Vanessa Helsing who wakes up to discover the world has been overrun by vampires.  ‘Van Helsing’ is based on the graphic novel series ‘Helsing’ and is not connected to the 2004 Universal action movie starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale.  Jonathan Scarfe, Christopher Heyerdahl, David Cubitt,Vincent Gale, Rukiya Bernard, Trezzo Mahoro, Laura Mennell and Paul Johansson also star.  Neil LaBute created the series and contributes as showrunner and writer. “I couldn’t be happier to learn that Syfy has renewed Van Helsing for a Season 3—it has been a wonderful journey thus far, but we have much more of the ‘Van Helsing’ saga to tell before we’re through.  It’s great to be working with Syfy on this project again, along with Chad and Mike at Nomadic and all the others at Dynamic and Echo Lake as well. The writing team has some amazing adventures planned for our cast and a few new surprises as well—expect blood to be spilled and characters to die screaming while the fate of humanity slips closer and closer to the edge of true chaos and utter darkness.” Universal had plans to reboot their ‘Van Helsing’ as part of their Dark Universe film series, but that appears to have stalled.  So for the time being, Syfy’s series may be the only monster-fighting narrative along these lines. Syfy recently cancelled several of their original shows, including ‘Blood Drive’, ‘Dark Matter’ and ‘Killjoys’, while it just premiered the surreal new series ‘Happy’ and has other ambitious projects in the works including George R.R. Martin’s ‘Nightflyers’, the Superman prequel ‘Krypton’, an update of ‘Tremors’ and an adaptation of the comic book ‘Deadly Class’. Jax's earliest memory is of watching 'Batman,' followed shortly by a memory of playing Batman & Robin with a friend, which entailed running outside in just their underwear and towels as capes.  When adults told them they couldn't run around outside in their underwear, both boys promptly whipped theirs off and ran around in just capes.","The latest issue of Shueisha‘s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine revealed Monday that Kohei Horikoshi’s My Hero Academia manga will receive an anime film that will premiere Summer 2018. The film will feature a brand-new story and will be supervised by the original creator himself. Horikoshi-san will also provide the original character designs. There is an additional comment from Horikoshi-san in the issue that states the movie will show the previously unrevealed past of a certain character. The film will feature the students of Class A. My Hero Academia launched it’s manga series back in July 2014, and instantly became a huge hit. It is currently one of the most popular series’ in Weekly Shonen Jump, and released its 16th standalone volume in November. MHA has inspired two television series, the first of which aired in April 2016. A third season has already been announced and will premiere in Spring 2018.","Update: A third season has been confirmed, and production is set to begin in late March 2018. Series star Will McCormack, who will direct the season premiere, confirmed that it will air exclusively on Netflix (as opposed to Netflix partnering with Showcase in Canada). The first season of the Canadian series, Travelers, aired on Netflix over the holidays in 2016 and provided a welcome sci-fi surprise that was the perfect balm for that time of year: It had a great premise, a likable cast, and compelling storylines that were complex but not complicated. It was escapist, but not dumb. It was binge-watching candy with a great hook — sending the consciences of people in the future into the bodies of people in the present seconds before they died — but it never sacrificed on character to serve the bigger story. Season two returned again over the holidays and provided mostly more of the same, although the second season deepened the mythology and stripped it largely of the case-of-the-week episodes. I found the latter aspect somewhat disappointing, because part of the allure of Travelers is watching people from the future take over the bodies of those in the present and attempt to integrate into their new lives with families they don’t know and jobs with which they are unfamiliar. I mean, the best part of every episode of Quantum Leap was watching Sam Beckett look into a mirror and come to terms with his new identity. Oh boy. But the second season more than made up for that loss by bringing in the always excellent Enrico Colantoni (Veronica Mars), who plays a more convincing than I might have imagined villain by the name of Vincent Ingram. There is no Keith Mars in this character. He is cold and calculating. Ingram is the original Traveler, sent as a test subject to the World Trade Center on 9/11. He was meant to die when the Towers fell, but he couldn’t bring himself to make that sacrifice, so he escaped and used his knowledge of the future to make millions playing the stock market. Advances in technology, however, made it progressively more difficult for him to escape the notice of The Director who could — with a simple phone call — kill Ingram with some supersonic noise that would give him an aneurysm (something both Ingram’s business partner and wife learned when they answered a phone call meant for him). Naturally, Ingram took out his anger on our favorite group of Travelers and ultimately hatched a plan to escape The Director’s detection. Meanwhile, while dealing with the overarching storyline (which also includes a rebellious sect of Travelers called The Faction), each of the major characters continue to confront drama in their own adopted lives. Again, the relationship between Marcy and David proves to be the most compelling — after having her memories erased, will Marcy fall back in love with David? (Yes, of course!) Also, can we just replace Chris Pratt with Patrick Gilmore? No one would know. Carly continues to experience challenges with her abusive husband while trying to maintain custody of their child; Trevor has to deal with the fact that his host body was sexually abused — along with many others — by his football coach; and Grant MacLaren (Erick McCormick) has to endure his wife’s pregnancy and the subsequent devastating loss of the baby. Loner Philip Pearson (Reilly Dolman) remains probably my favorite character — he’s the historian, and after uploading the rewritten future into his brain, he has to sit with the knowledge of what could happen to his friends even as it is happening. It all comes to a head in a B-A-N-A-N-A-S second season finale that sees Ingram kidnap the loved ones of all the Travelers and tell them that the people they love are not who they think they are. The Travelers, likewise, are forced to admit on video the truth to their loved ones — that they inhabited the bodies of their friends and family members. Those videos are released to the media, and by the end of the episode, the secret is out; the world knows the truth; the Travelers’ loved ones hate them; and Victor Ingram has transferred his conscience to his therapist. And then it’s over. O-V-E-R. Like 70 percent of viewers, I double and triple checked to ensure that there wasn’t a secret, hidden 13th episode. There isn’t. Worse still, Travelers has not officially been renewed for a third season. The series could very well end on a massive cliffhanger (and given Eric McCormick’s Will & Grace schedule, I have to imagine that Travelers takes a backseat). A third season has been confirmed, and production is set to begin in late March 2018. Series star Will McCormack, who will direct the season premiere, confirmed that it will air exclusively on Netflix. Showrunner Brad Wright has also suggested that the theme of season three — like the theme in season four of Black Mirror — would be Artificial Intelligence, and that we may see glimpses of the future. Wright has already mapped out next season. “We know where we’re going,” he said. “It’s not a question of, ‘Oh my God, we’ve painted ourselves into a corner, how do we get out of this?’ We know what we’re doing.” Dustin is the founder and co-owner of Pajiba.

The latest Zombie-Thriller series is set to amaze and scare audiences worldwide. As the release isn’t for a couple more months, here’s everything we know on release date, casting, and the status of a second season. Over the past few years, Korean films like Train to Busan and The Wailing have frightened audiences everywhere. Very much like the Japanese film industry, the Korean film industry has done an amazing job with finding a niche in the horror genre. With the massive success of zombie tv series like The Walking Dead and Z Nation, it was only a matter of time before someone else threw their hat into the ring and get a piece of the action. In the medieval Joseon period of Korea, a crown prince is sent on a suicide mission to investigate the origin of a plague ravishing his country. What he finds ultimately threatens the very existence of the Kingdom as an epidemic of Zombies is on the rise. A small list of the cast has been released unfortunately we don’t know all the roles for the actors below. The first season of Kingdom will have 6 episodes full of guts, gore, and zombie greatness. It’s been hard to find many stills of the show due to Netflix keeping Kingdom firmly under wraps. We were able to find some photos as seen below: While Kingdom may take some level of inspiration for the design of the zombies from Train to Busan, the series from what we know has no relation to the film. Just to clarify the story of Kingdom isn’t a prequel to the origin of the zombie virus from Train to Busan. Rampant is also another Joseon period zombie flick. The film is also made by the studio that produced Train to Busan but has no ties to Kingdom. The teaser for Kingdom has been out for a couple of weeks now, we can expect to see a full trailer closer to the release date. It may seem an obvious statement to say that Kingdom needs to be a success for Netflix. It’s not that we don’t think it will garner an audience, on the contrary, we think the show will be wildly successful but some controversy has surrounded the production of the show. At the start of 2018, it had been reported by a Korean news site that a member of staff on the art team for Kingdom had sadly died due to overwork. Obviously, this isn’t the fault of Netflix as this appears to be apart of a massive issue with working hours for broadcasters as a whole. To reiterate this isn’t the fault of Netflix as it is with the production studio but a show with the title of ‘Netflix Original’, if anything controversial happens during production this may reflect poorly on Netflix. Kingdom was originally planned to be a limited series of only 8 episodes with a 4-month production. Whereas now the series is being split into two 6 episode seasons and the production of each episode has cost roughly $1.78 Million. If the size of the audience is large enough then going over budget will be justified. Season one of Kingdom will be premiering worldwide on January 25th, 2019. It’s not very often the second season of a show is commissioned by Netflix before the release of the first but we can confirm that Kingdom will be returning for a second season! Production of season two is scheduled to begin in February 2019.

I will watch, wait & see. I just don’t care about zombies, lucky to see me watch vampires and witches! well maybe I will watch it like you said not before bed time. and a second season you say? really hope this is good then! Kingdom does have an awesome cast. This drama is only available on Netflix. I believe they funded/produced it and it’s not available anywhere else. I’ve seen the trailer and there are some pretty creepy scenes, so be prepared with camomile tea to calm your nerves, ha ha. Let me tell you that some shows on Netflx are so scary and I just can’t watch them. I was never the ‘‘scary type’’  of person.but  I can’t tolerate the zombies movies or dramas. There is one about a girl who turns into a zombie through sx with a guy, and  it has 2 seasons already.  I  tried to watch it but I  got so scared bc it feels so real. Train from Busan I jumped sky high the little pieces of the movie that I  saw, was by skipping the parts I couldn’t handle to watch. today I found one here  the king of blaze  2 parts, seems like, the first part zombies in the act. I have only watched abouit 5 episodes so will wait and see what happens  to the rest. I’m a chicken for scary dramas or movies, but having watched other us zombies series, world war z and train to busan, we found this drama less scary, not scary. [spoiler]- It lacks suspense and thrilling chills, some moments were really long  and sometimes lenghthy, we’re waiting for something to happen, the historical part was king of boring (always the same thing with someone wanting to grab the power, oh surprise it’s this person, like this part was predictable). The bad guy part was kinda boring (I will avenge him…). The queen part was also boring. The characters in the scenario lack depth. The evil intentions… sometimes you feel it not really natural and the same old song. So will watch the s2 for the siege, the zombies resolution, the dvp of crown prince and for the nurse.[/spoiler] I’m watching the KINGDOM drama  right now and all I do is jumping and screaming.",,,
