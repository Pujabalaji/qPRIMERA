where does the secretary bird get its name,"Its common name is popularly thought to derive from the crest of long quill-like feathers, lending the bird the appearance of a secretary with quill pens tucked behind their ear, as was once common practice. A more recent hypothesis is that ""secretary"" is borrowed from a French corruption of the Arabic saqr-et-tair or ""hunter-bird"".","The Secretary Bird or Secretarybird, Sagittarius serpentarius, is an extraordinary large, mostly terrestrial bird of prey. Origin of its name: There are a couple of potential origins of its name. One explanation was that it was named after the crest of long feathers at the back of its head that resemble quill pens that 19th century clerks stuck in their wigs. But recent findings indicate that its name was derived from the Arabic “saqr-et-tair”, meaning hunter-bird, which also translates into French as “secretaire”. Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the sub-Sahara. It is a large bird of prey in the order Falconiformes, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards, vultures, and harriers, but it is so distinctive that it is given its own family, Sagittaridae. The Secretary Bird enjoys a certain fame in Africa, specifically Sudan and South Africa, where it serves as a prominent Emblem on both countries’ Coat of Arms. The Secretary Bird is instantly recognizable as having an eagle-like body on crane-like legs which increases the bird’s height to around 1.3 m (4 ft) tall. This 140 cm (4.5 ft) long bird has an eagle-like head with a hooked bill, but has rounded wings. Body weight averages at about 3.3 kg (7.3 lbs) and the wingspan is over 2 m (6.6 ft). Due to its long legs and long tail, it is both longer and taller than any other diurnal raptor. Indeed, the Secretarybird has the longest legs of any raptor, and it must bend its legs in a crouch to feed or drink .The lower legs of Secretarybirds have heavy scales that may protect them while walking through the brush or when attacking their prey. From a distance or in flight it resembles a crane more than a bird of prey. The tail has two elongated central feathers that extend beyond the feet during flight, as well as long flat plumage creating a posterior crest. Secretary Bird flight feathers and thighs are black, while most of the coverts are grey with some being white. Sexes look similar to one another as the species exhibits very little sexual dimorphism, although the male has longer head plumes and tail feathers. Adults have a featherless red face as opposed to the yellow facial skin of the young. They can run so fast that they are sometimes referred to as “the devil’s horse.” They are excellent flyers, but they have a hard time getting off the ground. They have to make a long run with wings outspread before becoming airborne. That may be the reason why they appear to prefer running to flying. Secretary Birds are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and are non-migratory (although they may follow food sources). Their range is from Senegal to Somalia and south to the Cape of Good Hope. These birds are also found at a variety of elevations, from the coastal plains to the highlands. Secretary Birds prefer open grasslands and savannahs rather than forests and dense shrubbery which may impede their cursorial existence. While the birds roost on the local Acacia trees at night, they spend much of the day on the ground, returning to roosting sites just before dark. The Secretary Bird is largely terrestrial, hunting its prey on foot, and other than the caracara (such as Caracara plancus), is the only bird of prey to do so habitually. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as loose familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides. Prey consists of insects, small mammals, lizards, snakes, young birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in wildfires. Some secretary birds are kept on African farms to keep the snake population in check. Larger herbivores are not hunted, although there are some reports of Secretary Birds killing young gazelles. Young are fed liquefied and regurgitated insects directly by the male or female parent and are eventually weaned to small mammals and reptile fragments regurgitated onto the nest itself. The above foodstuffs are originally stored in the crop of the adults. Secretary Birds have two distinct feeding strategies that are both executed on land. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill, or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Studies of this latter strategy have helped reconstruct the possible feeding mechanisms employed by the dinosaur-like ‘terror birds’ of five million years ago. When Secretary Birds find a snake, they will either kill them with a powerful forward kick or they seize them with their claws and strike them on the back of the neck with the beak. They may use beak, wings and feet to kill a large snake. They use their wings wings as shields to keep from being bitten. Small prey are picked up in the bill and swallowed. The Secretary bird stamps its feet on the ground to flush out prey. In hunting and feeding on small animals and arthropods on the ground and in tall grass or scrub, Secretary Birds occupy an ecological niche similar to that occupied by peafowl in South and Southeast Asia, roadrunners in North and Central America and seriemas in South America. Secretary Birds associate in monogamous pairs. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, much like the way they chase prey. They usually mate on the ground, although some do so in Acacia trees. Nests are built at a height of 5–7 m (15–20 feet) on Acacia trees. Both the male and female visit the nest site for almost half a year before egg laying takes place. The nest is around 2.5 m (eight feet) wide and 30 cm (one foot) deep, and is constructed as a relatively flat basin of sticks and branches, lined with grass. Instead of building a new nest each year, they add a new layer of grass. Secretary birds lay two to three oval, pale-green eggs over the course of two to three days, although the third egg is most often unfertilised. These eggs are incubated primarily by the female for 45 days until they hatch. During this time, she is fed by her mate. The Secretary Birds are facultatively fratricidal. There are conflicting opinions on this phenomenon also called Cainism – “No evidence [exist] of sibling aggression, but youngest in brood of 3 almost always dies of starvation…” Considering that the 2 parents must provide food for 3 chicks at a rate of one feeding per hour after day 17 after incubation, one can understand why the last of the chicks to hatch has the least chance of survival. The downy young can feed autonomously after 40 days, although the parents still feed the young after that time. Both the parents feed the young. At 60 days, the young start to flap their wings, and by day 65-80 are able to fledge. Fledging is accomplished by jumping out of the nest or using a semi-controlled fall via fervent wing flapping to the ground. After this time, the young are quickly taught how to hunt through expeditions with their parents and are considered independent soon after. Young are predated by crows and kites as they are vulnerable in Acacia tree tops. As a population, the Secretary Bird is mainly threatened by loss of habitat and deforestation. In 1968 the species became protected under the Africa Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Nevertheless the species is still widespread across Africa, and has adapted well to arable land where prey animals such as rodents are more common than in traditional habitat. The species is well represented in protected areas as well. Secretary birds are almost completely silent birds, except for a rare croaking sound they utter when displaying. The Secretary Bird has traditionally been admired in Africa for its striking appearance and ability to deal with pests and snakes. As such it has often not been molested, although this is changing as traditional observances have declined. The Secretary Bird is the national emblem of Sudan as well as a prominent feature on the Coat of arms of South Africa. In Sudan, it is featured in the middle white strip of the Presidential Flag; it is the main object on the Presidential Seal, and features heavily in Sudanese military insignia. The Secretary Bird on the Presidential Flag and Seal has its head turned to the right, with its distinctive crest clearly visible and its wings spread out with a white banner between its outstretched wings reading “Victory is Ours”. In South Africa, the Secretary Bird, while not the official bird, is featured as a symbol on the national coat of arms, representing vigilance and military might, as well as the rise and pride of modern South Africa. The Secretary Bird has been a common motif for African countries on postage stamps, over 65 stamps from about 30 countries are known as of date including some from stamp-issuing entities such as Ajman, Manama. the Maldives and the United Nations where the bird does not occur. First described by English illustrator John Frederick Miller in 1779, the Secretary Bird was soon moved to its own genus, Sagittarius, by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinatum Animalium. It was not until 1935 that the species was moved to its own family, distinct from all other birds of prey—a classification confirmed by molecular systematics. Recent cladistic analysis has shown Sagittariidae to be an older branch of the diurnal birds of prey than Accipitridae and Falconidae, but a younger divergence than Cathartidae. Sometimes, the enigmatic bird Eremopezus is classified as an early relative of the secretary bird, though this is quite uncertain as the bird is only known from a few fragmentary body parts such as the legs. Its common name is popularly thought to derive from the crest of long quill-like feathers, lending the bird the appearance of a secretary with quill pens tucked behind his or her ear, as was once common practice. A more recent hypothesis is that “secretary” is borrowed from a French corruption of the Arabic saqr-et-tair or “hunter-bird.” The generic name “Sagittarius” is Latin for “archer,” perhaps likening the Secretary Bird’s “quills” to a quiver of arrows, and the specific epithet “serpentarius” recalls the bird’s skill as a hunter of reptiles.

How can’t I, after being in such an amazing place where nature is at its best? or graciously walking, looking down very serious, apparently worried about something, but in reality he’s just focused on catching his next meal. Known as the African ‘marching eagle’, the secretarybird is such an oddity that is placed in its own family, Sagittariidae, and some even go to the extreme of giving it its own order “Sagittariiformes” (Ferguson-Lees, Raptors of the World), but most classifications put this bird as part of the order Accipitriformes that, of course, makes him a close cousin of the eagles and hawks among other birds of prey. What makes this bird so different is that it is the only African raptor that hunts on foot, pursuing large insects, snakes and small rodents across the African savanna. Secretarybirds are endemic to the Sub-Saharan Africa and although nomadic, following food sources, they are non-migratory. Their range extends from Senegal to Somalia and South to the Cape of Good Hope. A large and distinctive bird of prey, the secretarybird is said to take its unusual name from the strange and distinguishing arrangement of feathers on the back of its neck. This long, raised crest of black, spatula-shaped feathers gives the secretarybird the appearance of an old-fashioned secretary carrying quill-pens tucked behind the ears. A more recent hypothesis to the origin of the name “secretary” is that is borrowed from a French corruption of the Arabic saqr-et-tair or “hunter-bird”. I have to say that the first explanation makes more sense to me since independently of how they hunt; all birds of prey are “hunter birds” after all. Watching the secretarybird hunt is not only fascinating to the ornithologist but it is a delight to any photographer. The trick is, of course, to be able to get a good sharp shot of this animal that hardly ever stops when in search of prey. Food is often discovered by the secretarybirds via stomping on clumps of vegetation flushing out the prey from their hiding places. This very smart bird also waits near fires, eating anything that is trying to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stepping on it until it is stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Africa’s ‘marching eagle’ spends most of the time on the ground, walking steadily with head jerking back and forward, at 100-120 paces per minute, averaging up to 3 km/h (1.8 mi/h), it may travel 20-30 km (12-19 mi) in a day. In general it prefers walking to running, and running to flying, but do not underestimate this bird because the secretarybird can fly very well often soaring like a stork, with neck and legs extended. It even has a spectacular aerial display, especially during mating season. I went to Africa with a bird “wishlist” that included eagles, storks, bustards and hornbills. I had to see hornbills above all, and I certainly wanted to see the famous Kori Bustard, the heaviest flying bird in the world. I had a photographic feast with the Southern Ground Hornbill and although I saw several white-bellied bustards did not see the Kori Bustard but have to say that spending photographic quality time with the secretarybird was one of the highlights and unexpected surprises of my trip to the Masai Mara.

Let’s not also forget its unique wildlife, colorful urban cities, exciting outdoor activities, and stunning rainforests — seriously, I could go on and on about Australia’s beauty! (Wild Kiwi Australia). So if you’re like me who is looking for an unforgettable adventure this year, you should seriously consider putting Australia high up on your list. Wild Kiwi is under ‘Navigate Travel‘ — a reputable tour company that is committed to offering high-quality holidays in places all over the world. This kind of strong dedication has led them to being market leaders in their field for over 10 years now, and this is further evidenced by the number of successful brands that they have. What are the basic inclusions in ALL of these Australia tours? An expert local guide + driver, transportation, accommodation, all breakfasts (sometimes some of the other meals), visits Australia’s best spots, select activities, and a surf camp experience. DISCLAIMER: All prices stated below may change. To be sure, always check Wild Kiwi’s website. Detailed itinerary: See details here.Cost: Starts from $2,299 AUD per person for this 14-day road trip that starts in Sydney and ends in Cairns. This cost already includes the following…Inclusions: Extras: There is a list of optional/additional activities that you can choose from all throughout the itinerary — from jet boating to sky diving or hot air balloon rides. These can cost between $10 to $300 AUD and I recommend setting a budget for these extra activities as they will be your biggest expense while traveling in Australia. Anyhow, regardless of what you’ll do, you’ll have the best time of your life! Starting in either Brisbane or Sydney, this is the perfect week-long road trip tour of Australia’s East Coast. There will certainly be a lot of unforgettable things that you will be doing and below are just some of the itinerary highlights: Detailed itinerary: See details here.Cost: Starts from $1,199 AUD per person for this 6-day road trip that starts from either Brisbane or Sydney. This cost already includes the following…Inclusions: Extras: There is a list of optional/additional activities that you can choose from all throughout the itinerary — from kayaking to sky diving. These can cost between $10 to $260 AUD and I recommend setting a budget for these extra activities as they will be your biggest expense while traveling in Australia. Anyhow, regardless of what you’ll do, you’ll have the best time of your life! IMPORTANT: Much like New Zealand, Australia has VERY strict quarantine laws for animal and vegetable derived products (any food, wooden products, seeds, etc) due to the relatively unspoiled Australian biosphere that they want to maintain. To ensure this is followed, they scan your baggage and even have dogs examine them. If you’re ever in doubt, ask for clarification — otherwise, you will be charged with a hefty fine of around $220 or more. Technically, there is NEVER a bad time to go to Australia; yet of course, weather can vary a lot in some places since this destination is undeniably huge and it will depend on your preference and budget. But as an overview, below are Australia’s seasons: High season usually happens in the winter given that April to September typically have a more pleasant weather — this is also the best time to visit the Grand Barrier Reef and the Red Centre. On the other hand, October to March is the low season since it’s just too hot or too wet. Yet again, costs are lower so some people brave the heat. The way I see it, if you want the middle ground without too much of a crowd and without shelling out too much money, it will be around September and/or October. If I may add a tip, avoid Australia on Boxing Day (December 26 until the end of January) because this is when the Aussies take their summer vacations. My go-to platform for grabbing the best flight deals is Skyscanner since it scans all the possible airlines that fly to and from your destination. I can even set up alerts so that it notifies me when the prices suddenly drop or rise. Most travelers arrive in Sydney, the largest city, at Sydney Airport (SYD) which is located 8km south of the city center. Airport Link offers a fast and convenient way to reach the city and suburbs, with trains running approximately every 10 minutes and at a cost of around $14 AUD. Other options are taxi (about $50AUD), shuttle and bus. As of 2015, Australia has no intention to provide visa-free access for any country, except for some who are given visitor visa exemptions to. You can check this list of countries to see if you need tourist visas to enter Australia or not. For more information, you can visit the Australia embassy that’s near you. Since Wild Kiwi mainly has Brisbane, Cairns and Sydney as starting and end points for their road trip journeys, below are the top accommodations that I recommend. (FYI: It is highly recommended that you take a minimum of 1 pre and post accommodation with your Wild Kiwi road trip journey to allot some time of relaxation before and after your flights.) Australia’s currency is called Australian Dollar (AUD).Rate exchange: USD $1 = AUD $1.40~ = Php 50~ (As of January 2019) To give you an idea, you should expect to travel in Australia with an average daily cost of about AUD $70~ per person on a budget, or at least $190~ if you want to experience more comfort on activities, tours, hotels, and more. (Values below show low budget to medium budget ranges). Australia is one of the safest countries in the world with very low crime rates — however, this is NO excuse to get too complacent. ‘Little crime’ does not mean ‘no crime’, so stay vigilant and be “street smart” by using your common sense at all times. Australia actually has no official languages but English has been the de facto national language with ‘Australian English’ as a major variety. That being said, it would not be a struggle for you to travel throughout the country as long as you can speak English. (The next most common spoken languages are Mandarin, Arabic, cantonese, Vietnamese and Italian). Hey there! I am Aileen Adalid.At 21, I quit my corporate job in the Philippines to pursue my dreams.

November 1963 John Fitzgerald „Jack“ Kennedy , häufig auch bei seinen Initialen JFK genannt, war von 1961 bis 1963 der 35. Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. In seine Amtszeit während der Hochphase des Kalten Krieges fielen historische Ereignisse wie die Invasion in der Schweinebucht, die Kubakrise, der Bau der Berliner Mauer, der Beginn der bemannten Raumfahrt, die Eskalation des Vietnamkriegs sowie die Zeit des zivilen Ungehorsams der afroamerikanischen Bürgerrechtsbewegung.Kennedy war Mitglied der Demokratischen Partei und der erste US-Präsident römisch-katholischer Konfession. Wegen seines jungen Alters und seines Charismas verkörperte er für viele die Hoffnung auf eine Erneuerung der USA. Die Hintergründe seiner Ermordung 1963 sind bis heute in der Öffentlichkeit umstritten. Wikipedia „Wir genießen den Komfort der Meinung ohne das Unbehagen des Gedankens.“ „Ein Leben in Freiheit ist nicht leicht, und die Demokratie ist nicht vollkommen. Aber wir hatten es nie nötig, eine Mauer aufzubauen, um unsere Leute bei uns zu halten und sie daran zu hindern, woanders hinzugehen.“ Rede vor dem Schöneberger Rathaus in Berlin, 26. Juni 1963.

I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist. If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him. 2. There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo Da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth also the age of Shakespeare, and the new frontier for which I campaign in public life, can also be a new frontier for American art. 3. I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit. 4. I look forward to an America which will reward achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business or statecraft. I look forward to an America which will steadily raise the standards of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all of our citizens. And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world not only for its strength but for its civilization as well. 5. This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor. To further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all the processes and fulfillments of art- this is one of the fascinating challenges of these days. 6. The life of the arts, far from being an interruption, a distraction, in the life of a nation, is very close to the center of a nation’s purpose, and is a test of the quality of a nation’s civilization. 7. And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you- ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. 8. All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. Throughout his life, John F. Kennedy had a strong commitment to the arts, believing art to be the highest achievement of the individual and an enduring source of national greatness. During his presidency, he brought the arts to center stage in the nation’s life. He was a driving force in creating a national center for the performing arts. Upon his death, the center he helped build was dedicated as the national presidential memorial, a living tribute to his memory.",,,,,,

More license information","Space environment is a branch of astronautics, aerospace engineering and space physics that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft. A related subject, space weather, deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, ionosphere and geomagnetic field, giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies. Effects on spacecraft can arise from radiation, space debris and meteoroid impact, upper atmospheric drag and spacecraft electrostatic charging. For long-duration missions, the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is also radiation-induced ""single-event effects"" such as single event upset. Crewed missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the International Space Station is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts. During solar energetic events (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in times as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to logic circuits, and even hazards to astronauts. Crewed missions to return to the Moon or to travel to Mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by solar particle events to radiation safety, in addition to the important contribution to doses from the low-level background cosmic rays. In near-Earth orbits, the Earth's geomagnetic field screens spacecraft from a large part of these hazards - a process called geomagnetic shielding. Space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds, causing mechanical or electrical damage.  The average speed of space debris is 10 km/s (22,000 mph; 36,000 km/h) [1]  while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater.  For example, the meteoroids associated with the Perseid meteor shower travel at an average speed of 58 km/s (130,000 mph; 210,000 km/h). [2]   Mechanical damage from debris impacts have been studied through space missions including LDEF, which had over 20,000 documented impacts through its 5.7-year mission. [3]   Electrical anomalies associated with impact events include ESA's Olympus spacecraft, which lost attitude control during the 1993 Perseid meteor shower. [4]   A similar event occurred with the Landsat 5 spacecraft [5]  during the 2009 Perseid meteor shower. [6] Spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot plasma environment around the Earth. The plasma encountered in the region of the geostationary orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic substorms caused by disturbances in the solar wind. ""Hot"" electrons (with energies in the kilo-electron volt range) collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts. As a result, discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies. Solutions devised by scientists and engineers include, but are not limited to, spacecraft shielding, special ""hardening"" of electronic systems, various collision detection systems. Evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment, including radiation belt models, spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentry. The field often overlaps with the disciplines of astrophysics, atmospheric science, space physics, and geophysics, albeit usually with an emphasis on application. The United States government maintains a Space Weather Prediction Center at Boulder, Colorado.  The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  SWPC is one of the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Space weather effects on Earth can include ionospheric storms, temporary decreases in ozone densities, disruption to radio communication, to GPS signals and submarine positioning. Some scientists also theorize links between sunspot activity and ice ages. Space environmentalism is an advocacy that sees space as not devoid of needing regulation and protection, and has gained attention by an increasing number of academics, [7]  such as Moriba Jah. [8] The Leonids are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel–Tuttle, which are also known for their spectacular meteor storms that occur about every 33 years. The Leonids get their name from the location of their radiant in the constellation Leo: the meteors appear to radiate from that point in the sky. Their proper Greek name should be Leontids, but the word was initially constructed as a Greek/Latin hybrid and it has been used since. They peak in the month of November. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV. The composition of the solar wind plasma also includes a mixture of materials found in the solar plasma: trace amounts of heavy ions and atomic nuclei such as C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe. There are also rarer traces of some other nuclei and isotopes such as P, Ti, Cr, 54Fe and 56Fe, and 58Ni, 60Ni, and 62Ni. Superposed with the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude. Its particles can escape the Sun's gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona, which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field. A solar flare is an intense localized eruption of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere. Flares occur in active regions and are often, but not always, accompanied by coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other solar phenomena. The occurrence of solar flares varies with the 11-year solar cycle. A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetosphere. Earth has two such belts, and sometimes others may be temporarily created. The belts are named after James Van Allen, who is credited with their discovery. Earth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 640 to 58,000 km above the surface, in which region radiation levels vary. Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction. A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body in outer space. Space weather is a branch of space physics and aeronomy, or heliophysics, concerned with the time varying conditions within the Solar System, including the solar wind, emphasizing the space surrounding the Earth, including conditions in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. Space weather is distinct from but conceptually related to the terrestrial weather of the atmosphere of Earth. The term space weather was first used in the 1950s and came into common usage in the 1990s. Later, it was generalized to a ""Space Climate"" research discipline which focuses on general behaviors of longer and larger-scale variabilities and effects. A geomagnetic storm, also known as a magnetic storm, is a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids. The Meteor Data Centre lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established. Several organizations point to viewing opportunities on the Internet. NASA maintains a daily map of active meteor showers. A micrometeoroid is a tiny meteoroid: a small particle of rock in space, usually weighing less than a gram. A micrometeorite is such a particle that survives passage through Earth's atmosphere and reaches Earth's surface. An atmosphere is a layer of gas or layers of gases that envelope a planet, and is held in place by the gravity of the planetary body. A planet retains an atmosphere when the gravity is great and the temperature of the atmosphere is low. A stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star, which includes the layers above the opaque photosphere; stars of low temperature might have outer atmospheres containing compound molecules. The Perseids are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Swift–Tuttle. The meteors are called the Perseids because the point from which they appear to hail lies in the constellation Perseus. The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), named the Space Environment Center (SEC) until 2007, is a laboratory and service center of the US National Weather Service (NWS), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), located in Boulder, Colorado. SWPC continually monitors and forecasts Earth's space environment, providing solar-terrestrial information. SWPC is the official source of space weather alerts and warnings for the United States. The interplanetary dust cloud, or zodiacal cloud, consists of cosmic dust that pervades the space between planets within planetary systems, such as the Solar System. This system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature, origin, and relationship to larger bodies. Space physics, also known as solar-terrestrial physics or space-plasma physics, is the study of plasmas as they occur naturally in the Earth's upper atmosphere (aeronomy) and within the Solar System. As such, it encompasses a far-ranging number of topics, such as heliophysics which includes the solar physics of the Sun, the solar wind, planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres, auroras, cosmic rays, and synchrotron radiation. Space physics is a fundamental part of the study of space weather and has important implications in not only to understanding the universe, but also for practical everyday life, including the operations of communications and weather satellites. Health threats from cosmic rays are the dangers posed by cosmic rays to astronauts on interplanetary missions or any missions that venture through the Van-Allen Belts or outside the Earth's magnetosphere. They are one of the greatest barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft, but space radiation health risks also occur for missions in low Earth orbit such as the International Space Station (ISS). Energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging, often described as ""seeing with atoms"", is a technology used to create global images of otherwise invisible phenomena in the magnetospheres of planets and throughout the heliosphere. Sigrid Close is a professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. Her primary research interest is the space environment with particular focus on meteoroids, meteors, and orbital debris, and their interaction with spacecraft and spacecraft operations. In solar physics, a solar particle event (SPE), also known as a solar proton event, prompt proton event, or solar radiation storm, is a solar phenomenon which occurs when particles emitted by the Sun, mostly protons, become accelerated either in the Sun's atmosphere during a solar flare or in interplanetary space by a coronal mass ejection shock. Other nuclei such as helium and HZE ions may also be accelerated during the event. These particles can penetrate the Earth's magnetic field and cause partial ionization of the ionosphere. Energetic protons are a significant radiation hazard to spacecraft and astronauts. ESA Vigil, formerly known as Lagrange, is a planned solar weather mission by the European Space Agency. It envisions two spacecraft to be positioned at Lagrangian points L1 and L5. Gerhard Drolshagen is a German physicist at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, specializing in space environment and near-Earth objects (NEO). He has been a staff member at the European Space Agency (ESA), European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The Netherlands (1987–2016) and is known for his work in space environment, NEO and for the asteroid named after him: the asteroid 332733 Drolshagen.","Many people claim that they have seen meteor shower, so did I. But after my senior sent a youtube video to me and said he had witness this explosion and counted almost 10,000 meteors at that night at Maobitou parking lot. After I opened this video, I was completely astonished and touched by it. That is: “2001 Leonids Meteor Shower”! Enjoy it! News of Leonids from JapanHave you ever seen that before with your own eyes? Can you believe that DID REALLY HAPPEN? Wasn't it a magnificent, fascinating and lovely astronomical phenomenon? I have been to Chung-liao tea garden and waiting for the meteor shower for whole night in 1998. Unfortunately, it really disappointing me because I only saw few bolides fell down from the sky and except that was nothing but people’s flashlights and voices. Few months ago, when I was chatting with my senior, he told me that he have witness the REAL explosion Leonids in 2001 and 1998 was a wrong forecast(it was earlier about 24 hours ). I sank into a deeply melancholy immediately like I missed my most favorite thing. You may think that this is kind of ridiculous but I was really depressed at that time.But there still a good news. This meteor shower’s explosion cycle is about 33 years and the latest explosion was 1998~2002. That means, we also have chance to see the Leonids Meteor Shower like the video above with our eyes in the lifetime!! Isn’t that interesting and worth expecting? =DBrief Introduction of Leonids:The Leonids are a meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel-Tuttle. The Leonids get their name from the location of their radiant in the constellation Leo: the meteors appear to stream from that point in the sky. The meteor shower is visible every year around November 17, plus or minus a week, when the Earth moves through the meteoroid stream of particles left from the passages of the comet. Introduction source and if you want more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids You are really enthusiastic about stars, aren't you? :D I think people who want to watch stars need very GOOD LUCK indeed. Remember last time we went to 旭海? What a pity that we couldn't see stars due to the bad weather. Though I cannot tell stars' names from so many of them, the view is still charming and touching. Hope I can join your star trip in the future. Yeah... it really need some luck to see the starlight!I hope to see you at our next outdoor observation!!!!!! It may be hold about October~ Oh my goodness, the video above are way too disgusting…I mean, who the hell can see so many falling stars at one minute?? Alright, I admit that it’s really a marvelous and fantastic scene. Remember last semester, the time when we stay up to watch the meteor shower (Leonids or…? Cannot remember.)? It was great but surely the stars were not as much as those in the video.   A marvelous meteor shower is no doubt great, but I like the night sky with few stars as well because that makes me admire every single star quietly and cherish them. Ti didn’t see much the last time I went to watch the shower, but I was happy. The few stars made me think of the song… Catch a falling star and put it in a pocket, never let it fade away… Shirley:Ha ha. I think you are quite special that you don't want to see the sky which is full of shining stars... don't you think that it is like the jewelry box?The meteor shower we saw last semester was ""Orionids"", which are caused by the well-known Halley's Comet! I said I DO want to see a real meteor lar!XD If so, that will definaely be a great memery to keep in my whole life. And I believe anyone who had seen such an majestic view would feel much different about the universe and life, too.But the sky with few stars has another beauty. It's not cherished because it's too common! haha sorry for not notice that XDI think that meteor shower is one of the most beautiful astronomical phenomenon in the universe... It will be very wonderful and unforgetable to see once in your lifetime. Just once. My senior told me that after he saw the Leonids, he rode motorcycle back to NSYSU and had a mid-term exam. He think that it was worth doing such crazy behavior no matter he would fell the exam or not. Compare with Leonids, mid-term doesn't matter! I think if I would him, I may do the same thing because it really worth! How do you think?Few stars in the sky... like the ""smile in the night""? It was really awesome and beautiful! But I don't think that we won't cherish stars if there's many. We will be very exciting and more cherish them because we can't see that many in the city!","Well, this is awkward. The site you're looking for is not here.","A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's surface. Intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which may produce greater than 1000 meteors an hour. The Meteor Data Centre lists about 600 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established. Several organizations provide viewing opportunities on the Internet. The Quadrantids (QUA) are a January meteor shower. The zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of this shower can be as high as that of two other reliably rich meteor showers, the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December, yet Quadrantid meteors are not seen as often as meteors in these other two showers, because the peak intensity is exceedingly sharp, sometimes lasting only hours. Additionally, the meteors are quite faint (mean magnitude 3-6 mag). The radiant point of this shower is at the northern edge of the constellation Boötes, not far from the Big Dipper. It lies between the end of the handle of the Big Dipper and the quadrilateral of stars marking the head of the constellation Draco. This meteor shower is best seen in the northern hemisphere, but it can be seen partly to 50 degrees south latitude. The April Lyrids (LYR, IAU shower number 6 ) are a meteor shower lasting from April 14 to April 30th. The radiant of the meteor shower is located in the constellation Lyra, near this constellation's brightest star, Alpha Lyrae (proper name Vega). The source of the meteor shower is particles of dust shed by the long-period Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher. The April Lyrids are the strongest annual shower of meteors from debris of a long-period comet, mainly because as far as other intermediate long-period comets go (200–10,000 years), this one has a relatively short orbital period of about 415 years. The Lyrids have been observed and reported since 687 BC; no other modern shower has been recorded as far back in time. Counts typically range from 5 to 20 meteors per hour, averaging around 10. As a result of light pollution, observers in rural areas will see more than observers in a city. Nights without a moon in the sky will reveal the most meteors. April Lyrid meteors are usually around magnitude +2. However, some meteors can be brighter, known as ""Lyrid fireballs"", cast shadows for a split second and leave behind smokey debris trails that last minutes. The Eta Aquariids are a meteor shower associated with Halley's Comet. Unlike most major annual meteor showers, there is no sharp peak for this shower, but rather a plateau of good rates that last approximately one week centered on May 7. The meteors we currently see as members of the Eta Aquariid shower separated from Halley’s Comet hundreds of years ago. The current orbit of Halley’s Comet does not pass close enough to the Earth to be a source of meteoric activity. Although this shower is not as spectacular as the Leonids, it is not an ordinary event. The Eta Aquariids get their name because their radiant appears to lie in the constellation Aquarius, near one of the constellation's brightest stars, Eta Aquarii. The shower peaks at about a rate of around a meteor per minute, although such rates are rarely seen from northern latitudes due to the low altitude of the radiant. The Eta Aquariids are best viewed in the pre-dawn hours away from the glow of city lights. For northern observers, the radiant of the shower is only above the horizon for the few hours before dawn, and early-rising observers are often rewarded with rates that climb as the radiant rises before sunrise. The shower is best viewed from the equator to 30 degrees south latitude. The Southern Delta Aquariids are a meteor shower visible from mid July to mid August each year. The shower originated from the breakup of what are now the Marsden and Kracht Sungrazing comets. The Delta Aquariids get their name because their radiant appears to lie in the constellation Aquarius, near one of the constellation's brightest stars, Delta Aquarii. The name derives from the Latin possessive form ""Aquarii"". There are two branches of the Delta Aquariid meteor shower, Southern and Northern. The Southern Delta Aquariids are considered a strong shower, with an average meteor observation rate of 15–20 per hour, and a peak zenith hourly rate of 18. The average radiant is at RA=339°, DEC=−17°. The Northern Delta Aquariids are a weaker shower, peaking later in mid August, with an average peak rate of 10 meteors per hour. The meteor shower was discovered by Hungarian astronomer Miklos von Konkoly-Thege in 1871.This shower has infrequent but relatively bright meteors, with some fireballs. Parent body is comet 169P/NEAT. Peter Jenniskens and Jeremie Vaubaillon identified the parent body as asteroid 2002 EX12, which in the return of 2005 was found weakly active near perihelion. This object is now called comet 169P/NEAT. According to Jenniskens and Vaubaillon, the meteor shower was created about 3,500 to 5,000 years ago, when about half of the parent body disintegrated and fell into dust. The dust cloud evolved into Earth's orbit recently, causing a shower with peak rates of 2-5/h, sometimes having outbursts of bright flaring meteors with rates up to 5-9/h. The bulk of the dust will not be in Earth's path until the 24th century. The Alpha Capricornids are expected to become a major annual storm in 2220–2420 A.D., one that will be ""stronger than any current annual shower."" The stream of debris is called the Perseid cloud and stretches along the orbit of the comet Swift–Tuttle. The cloud consists of particles ejected by the comet as it travels on its 133-year orbit. Most of the particles have been part of the cloud for around a thousand years. However, there is also a relatively young filament of dust in the stream that was pulled off the comet in 1865, which can give an early mini-peak the day before the maximum shower. The dimensions of the cloud in the vicinity of the Earth are estimated to be approximately 0.1 astronomical units (AU) across and 0.8 AU along the latter’s orbit, spread out by annual interactions with the Earth’s gravity. Depending on the particular location of the stream. During the peak, the rate of meteors reaches 60 or more per hour. They can be seen all across the sky; however, because of the shower’s radiant in the constellation of Perseus, the Perseids are primarily visible in the Northern Hemisphere. As with many meteor showers the visible rate is greatest in the pre-dawn hours, since more meteoroids are scooped up by the side of the Earth moving forward into the stream, corresponding to local times between midnight and noon, as can be seen in the accompanying diagram. While many meteors arrive between dawn and noon, they are usually not visible due to daylight. Some can also be seen before midnight, often grazing the Earth’s atmosphere to produce long bright trails and sometimes fireballs. Most Perseids burn up in the atmosphere while at heights above 80 kilometres (50 mi). The Taurids are an annual meteor shower, associated with the comet Encke. The Taurids are actually two separate showers, with a Southern and a Northern component. The Southern Taurids originated from Comet Encke, while the Northern Taurids originated from the asteroid 2004 TG10. They are named after their radiant point in the constellation Taurus, where they are seen to come from in the sky. Because of their occurrence in late October and early November, they are also called Halloween fireballs. Encke and the Taurids are believed to be remnants of a much larger comet, which has disintegrated over the past 20,000 to 30,000 years, breaking into several pieces and releasing material by normal cometary activity or perhaps occasionally by close encounters with the tidal force of Earth or other planets (Whipple, 1940; Klačka, 1999). In total, this stream of matter is the largest in the inner solar system. Since the meteor stream is rather spread out in space, Earth takes several weeks to pass through it, causing an extended period of meteor activity, compared with the much smaller periods of activity in other showers. The Taurids are also made up of weightier material, pebbles instead of dust grains. The radiant of the Orionids is located between the constellations Orion and Gemini (in the south-eastern sky before dawn, as viewed from mid-northern latitudes. Universe Today reported that the meteor shower arrived at 140,000 miles (230,000 km) per hour on the morning of the 21 when showing was predicted to be at its height, however compared to previous showers in years past, the trail of 2009 appeared narrower without branching out. Observers observing the small meteor ""Halleyids"" at Alabama's Space Flight Center saw streaks radiating in all directions with the naked eye.

The Taurids are also made up of weightier material, pebbles instead of dust grains. The Leonids are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel –Tuttle. The Leonids get their name from the location of their radiant in the constellation Leo: the meteors appear to radiate from that point in the sky. They peak in the month of November. Earth moves through the meteoroid stream of particles left from the passages of a comet. The stream comprises solid particles, known as meteoroids, ejected by the comet as its frozen gases evaporate under the heat of the Sun when it is close enough – typically closer than Jupiter's orbit. The Leonids are a fast moving stream which encounter the path of Earth and impact at 72 km/s Larger Leonids which are about 10 mm across have a mass of half a gram and are known for generating bright (apparent magnitude −1.5) meteors. An annual Leonid shower may deposit 12 or 13 tons of particles across the entire planet. The meteoroids left by the comet are organized in trails in orbits similar to though different from that of the comet. They are differentially disturbed by the planets, in particular Jupiter and to a lesser extent by radiation pressure from the sun, the Poynting–Robertson effect, and the Yarkovsky effect. These trails of meteoroids cause meteor showers when Earth encounters them. Old trails are spatially not dense and compose the meteor shower with a few meteors per minute. In the case of the Leonids, that tends to peak around November 18, but some are spread through several days on either side and the specific peak changes every year. Conversely, young trails are spatially very dense and the cause of meteor outbursts when the Earth enters one. Meteor storms (large outbursts) exceed 1000 meteors per hour, to be compared to the sporadic background (5 to 8 meteors per hour) and the shower background (several per hour). The Geminids are a meteor shower caused by the object 3200 Phaethon, which is thought to be a Palladian asteroid with a ""rock comet"" orbit. This would make the Geminids, together with the Quadrantids, the only major meteor showers not originating from a comet. The meteors from this shower are slow moving, can be seen in December and usually peak around mid December , with the date of highest intensity being the morning of the peak. The shower is thought to be intensifying every year and recent showers have seen 120–160 meteors per hour under optimal conditions, generally around 02:00 to 03:00 local time. Geminids were first observed in 1862, much more recently than other showers such as the Perseids (36 AD) and Leonids (902 AD). The meteors in this shower appear to come from a radiant in the constellation Gemini (hence the shower's name). However, they can appear almost anywhere in the night sky, and often appear yellowish in hue. Well north of the equator, the radiant rises about sunset, reaching a usable elevation from the local evening hours onwards. In the southern hemisphere, the radiant appears only around local midnight or so. Observers in the northern hemisphere will see higher Geminid rates as the radiant is higher in the sky. The meteors travel at medium speed in relation to other showers, at about 22 miles per second (35 km/s), making them fairly easy to spot. The Geminids are now considered by many to be the most consistent and active annual shower. Geminids disintegrate while at heights above 24 miles (39 km). The Ursids (URS) meteor activity begins annually around December 17 and runs for a week plus, until the 25th or 26th. This meteor shower is named for its radiant point which is located near the star Beta Ursae Minoris in the constellation Ursa Minor. Ursid shower delivers only a modest 10 meteors per hour under even the best conditions, it has the advantage of having a radiant near the bowl of the Little Dipper — so it's in view all night from northern latitudes. Chelyabinsk meteor. The Chelyabinsk meteor was a superbolide caused by an approximately 20-metre near-Earth asteroid that entered Earth's atmosphere over Russia on 15 February 2013 at about 09:20 YEKT (03:20 UTC), with a speed of 19.16 ± 0.15 kilometres per second (60,000–69,000 km/h or 40,000–42,900 mph). It quickly became a brilliant superbolide meteor over the southern Ural region. The light from the meteor was brighter than the Sun, visible up to 100 km (62 mi) away. It was observed over a wide area of the region and in neighboring republics. Some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball. Due to its high velocity and shallow angle of atmospheric entry, the object exploded in an air burst over Chelyabinsk Oblast, at a height of around 29.7 km (18.5 mi; 97,000 ft). The explosion generated a bright flash, producing a hot cloud of dust and gas that penetrated to 26.2 km (16.3 mi), and many surviving small fragmentary meteorites, as well as a large shock wave. The bulk of the object's energy was absorbed by the atmosphere, with a total kinetic energy before atmospheric impact estimated from infrasound and seismic measurements to be equivalent to the blast yield of 400–500 kilotons of TNT (about 1.4–1.8 PJ) range – 26 to 33 times as much energy as that released from the atomic bomb detonated at Hiroshima. The object was undetected before its atmospheric entry, in part because its radiant was close to the Sun. Its explosion created panic among local residents, and about 1,500 people were injured seriously enough to seek medical treatment. All of the injuries were due to indirect effects rather than the meteor itself, mainly from broken glass from windows that were blown in when the shock wave arrived, minutes after the superbolide's flash. Some 7,200 buildings in six cities across the region were damaged by the explosion's shock wave, and authorities scrambled to help repair the structures in sub-freezing temperatures. With an estimated initial mass of about 12,000–13,000 metric tons (13,000–14,000 short tons, heavier than the Eiffel Tower), and measuring about 20 metres in diameter, it is the largest known natural object to have entered Earth's atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, which destroyed a wide, remote, forested, and very sparsely populated area of Siberia. The Chelyabinsk meteor is also the only meteor confirmed to have resulted in a large number of injuries. No deaths were reported. The earlier-predicted and well-publicized close approach of a larger asteroid on the same day, the roughly 30-metre 367943 Duende, occurred about 16 hours later; the very different orbits of the two objects showed they were unrelated to each other. Local residents witnessed extremely bright burning objects in the sky in Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, and Orenburg Oblasts, the Republic of Bashkortostan, and in neighbouring regions in Kazakhstan, when the asteroid entered the Earth's atmosphere over Russia. Amateur videos showed a fireball streaking across the sky and a loud boom several minutes afterwards. Some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball. The event began at 09:20:21 Yekaterinburg time, several minutes after sunrise in Chelyabinsk, and minutes before sunrise in Yekaterinburg. According to eyewitnesses, the bolide appeared brighter than the sun, as was later confirmed by NASA.An image of the object was also taken shortly after it entered the atmosphere by the weather satellite Meteosat 9. Witnesses in Chelyabinsk said that the air of the city smelled like ""gunpowder"", ""sulfur"" and ""burning odors"" starting about 1 hour after the fireball and lasting all day. A meteoroid is a small body moving in the solar system that would become a meteor if it entered the earth's atmosphere. A meteor is a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth's atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light. A meteorite a piece of rock or metal that has fallen to the earth's surface from outer space as a meteor. Over 90 per cent of meteorites are of rock while the remainder consist wholly or partly of iron and nickel. Stony meteorites are meteorites made of rock, but can also contain small amounts of iron. There are two types of stony mete- orites; chondrites and achondrites.Chondrites are the most common type of meteorite. These are meteorites which have not undergone any alteration or changes since they were formed. It is estimated between 36 and 166 meteorites larger than 10 grams fall to Earth per million square kilometres per year. Over the whole surface area of Earth, that translates to 18,000 to 84,000 meteorites bigger than 10 grams per year. To date, there have been nearly 1,100 recovered falls (meteorites seen to fall) and nearly 40,000 finds (found, but not seen to fall). It is estimated that probably 500 meteorites reach the surface of the Earth each year, but less than 10 are recovered. Owning one is the only way to touch the cosmos, and the demand for such an experience is quite high all over the world! Many have called them the “truest form of black gold,” and they often sell for $300.00 per gram or more - meaning a 1 pound meteorite can be worth a million dollars. The oldest impact crater on Earth is also the largest. Vredefort crater in South Africa, also called the Vredefort Dome, was originally 185 miles (300 kilometers) across, scientists estimate. A meteorite or asteroid bigger than South Africa's Table Mountain blasted out the giant crater 2.02 billion years ago Stony-Iron Meteorites. The least abundant of the three main types, the stony-irons, account for less than 2% of all known meteorites. They are comprised of roughly equal amounts of nickel-iron and stone and are divided into two groups: pallasites and mesosiderites. The farmer had discovered a 66-ton iron meteorite - the largest single meteorite ver found and the largest piece of iron ever found near Earth's surface.

when did antarctica's permanent ice cap form,"The icing of Antarctica began in the middle Eocene about 45.5 million years ago and escalated during the Eocene -- Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago. CO levels were then about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of 600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation. The glaciation was favored by an interval when the Earth's orbit favored cool summers but oxygen isotope ratio cycle marker changes were too large to be explained by Antarctic ice-sheet growth alone indicating an ice age of some size. The opening of the Drake Passage may have played a role as well though models of the changes suggest declining CO levels to have been more important.","The Antarctic ice sheet is one of the two polar ice caps of the Earth. It covers about 98% of the Antarctic continent and is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost 14 million square km and contains 26.5 million cubic km of ice. That is, approximately 61 percent of all fresh water on the Earth is held in the Antarctic ice sheet, an amount equivalent to 70 m of water in the world’s oceans. In East Antarctica, the ice sheet rests on a major land mass, but in West Antarctica the bed can extend to more than 2,500 m below sea level. The land in this area would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The icing of Antarctica began with ice-rafting from middle Eocene times about 45.5 million years ago and escalated inland widely during the Eocene – Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago. CO2 levels were then about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of 600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation.

Ice enters the sheet through precipitation as snow. This snow is then compacted to form glacier ice which moves under gravity towards the coast. Most of it is carried to the coast by fast moving ice streams. The ice then passes into the ocean, often forming vast floating ice shelves. These shelves then melt or calve off to give icebergs that eventually melt. If the transfer of the ice from the land to the sea is balanced by snow falling back on the land then there will be no net contribution to global sea levels. A 2002 analysis of NASA satellite data from 1979 – 1999 showed that while overall the land ice is decreasing, areas of Antarctica where sea ice was increasing outnumbered areas of decreasing sea ice roughly 2:1. The general trend shows that a warming climate in the southern hemisphere would transport more moisture to Antarctica, causing the interior ice sheets to grow, while calving events along the coast will increase, causing these areas to shrink. A 2006 paper derived from satellite data, measures changes in the gravity of the ice mass, suggests that the total amount of ice in Antarctica has begun decreasing in the past few years. Another recent study compared the ice leaving the ice sheet, by measuring the ice velocity and thickness along the coast, to the amount of snow accumulation over the continent. This found that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was in balance but the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was losing mass. This was largely due to acceleration of ice streams such as Pine Island Glacier. These results agree closely with the gravity changes. © Copyright 2011 – 2023 Climate State.

The village is known for the nearby archaeological digs which have yielded some well-known hominin fossils. According to Jon Kalb, early maps show caravan routes passing within 10 or 15 kilometers of Hadar but not through it. The British explorer L.M. Nesbitt passed 15 kilometres west of Hadar in 1928.[1] Hadar is located in Mille woreda, which is part of the Administrative Zone 1 of the Afar Region. The Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for its 2005 population. On 4 February 2007, the Afar Regional Cabinet approved the creation of a new woreda, taken from the western part of Mille woreda, with its administrative center to be at Hadar.[2] The first paleo-geological explorations of the Hadar area were by Maurice Taieb. He found Hadar in December 1970 by following the Ledi River, which originates in the highlands north of Bati to empty into the Awash River. Taieb recovered a number of fossils in the area, and led a party back to Hadar May 1972. In October 1973 the International Afar Research Expedition with 16 people arrived at Hadar and encamped for two months, during which time the first hominin fossil was found. (Taeib claims in his 1985 book Sur la terre des premiers hommes to have discovered the Hadar fields in 1968; but Kalb argues that this claim of an earlier find is incorrect.) The IARE party examined a series of sedimentary layers which they named the Hadar Formation, and which they dated from late Pliocene to early Pleistocene times, or, 3.5 to 2.3 million years ago.[3] A member of the 1973 expedition to Hadar, the archeologist Donald Johanson,  returned to Hadar the next year and discovered the fossil hominin Lucy, a 3.2 million-year-old fossilized specimen of Australopithecus afarensis. (The name 'Lucy' was inspired by the song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", by The Beatles, which happened to be playing on the radio at base camp.) About thirty years later in nearby Dikika, a fossil skeleton of another  Australopithecus afarensis was found in a separate outcrop of the Hadar Formation across the Awash River from Hadar. The skeleton is of a three-year-old girl later named ""Selam"", which means peace in several Ethiopian languages. Coordinates: 11°10′N 40°38′E﻿ / ﻿11.167°N 40.633°E﻿ / 11.167; 40.633",,,,,,,,,

However, as in most aspects of biology, there are some grey areas. These include deciding what is or is not a plant, what are the boundaries between herbivores that mostly feed on live plants and saprovores that feed on dead plants and dead animals and are all pollinators herbivores. The place of a species within the environment can be defined several ways: by its feeding type, by its "" ecological function"" or by the concept of  "" ecosystem services"".   These concepts are discussed below. Herbivores are often regarded as pests, because they damage plants. When herbivores may be regarded as pests is discussed below. In addition there are terms for the host range (number of species) that an organism lives on. The following explanations of different ""life styles"" are based on information in Gordh G., Headrick D. 2001. A Dictionary of Entomology. CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK. 1-1032 pages. Herbivores can be regarded as converting plant tissue into animal protein that is more suitable as food of other organisms. The beneficiaries of this include insect eating birds and lizards. It is noteworthy that some mainly herbivorous birds switch to insect eating when they are feeding their young. A second benefit from insects and mites feeding on plants is that they contribute to an increase in the productivity of the ecosystem by increasing the rate of nutrient recycling through making plant nutrients available through their excreta and dead bodies. Three terms are commonly used to describe the host range of animals (including herbivores), monophagous, oligophagous and polyphagous. Monophagous. Feeds on only one species (of plant). Oligophagous. Feeds on several species (of plant). Oligophagous herbivores may be divided into two groups, those that feed on species in one genus and those feeding on species in several genera and which can be in up to two families. The first group being indicated as Oligophagous (genus). Polyphagous. Feeds on many species (of plant). A herbivore is sometimes defined as polyphagous if it feeds on species from three or more families of plants. There is a common saying that a weed is a plant in the wrong place. Similarly, a herbivore is only a pest when it is in the wrong place. New Zealand native herbivores are part of New Zealand's biodiversity and are not pests in native ecosystems and like native birds should, in general, be encouraged, on their native host plants outside native ecosystems. However, some species that cause unacceptable damage to valued non-native plants, such as lemon tree borer on citrus trees and grass grub on pasture grasses. In these circumstances these species are regarded as pests. The feeding of some native herbivores on native plants in gardens and parks can also cause unacceptable damage, especially while a plant is young and at this stage the plant may need some protection. However, if people grow native plants they should expect, that once the plant is established, it will host native invertebrates. By doing so they are contributing to increasing the native biodiversity of the area, and in some cases helping monophagous herbivores to survive, e.g. Aceria clianthi Lamb 1952 (Acari: Eriophyidae) on Clianthus puniceus (G. Don) Lindley (Fabaceae) (Kakabeak). Herbivores from overseas may also be pests or beneficial. Many crop pests are overseas herbivores, though some herbivores have been deliberately introduced into New Zealand to help control weeds. An example of a weed biological control agent is the gorse mite, Tetranychus linearius Dufour (Acari: Tetranychidae) that forms webbing on young growth of gorse (Ulex europaeus L.). Herbivores from overseas that feed on native plants are pests, especially where they occur in native ecosystems. Many do not cause serious harm to the native host plants, but heavily infested plants are sometimes found and this may be particularly serious where it occurs in native ecosystems.","All livestock projects need proper nutrition, but proper timing of feeding is also important. Typically, we advise youth to feed project animals twice per day, once in the morning and again in the evening. This is because it follows the normal feeding rhythms of livestock, especially ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats. Normally ruminants on pasture appear to feed all day long, but if you watch them closely, there are times they are actively eating and other times when they are not. This down time is due to their need to ruminate and digest the forage they have eaten. Remember a ruminant fills their rumen with forage, then it is the rumen microbes turn to digest and breakdown the food into smaller, more useful forms. This is when we see cattle, sheep or goats, laying down and ""chewing their cud"". The scientific term for their cud is a bolus. A bolus is partially digested food that needs to be broken down again by chewing and returns back into the rumen for a final microbial digest. In the afternoon is when we generally observe this behavior of laying down and cud chewing. Animals spend most of the morning grazing and so an afternoon of resting and ruminating is normal. After this afternoon down time, ruminants tend to get up and graze again in the evening and then lay down, ruminate and sleep during the night. For project animals, we control the times of day when feed and forage is available. It makes sense to feed ruminants when they are used to eating. It is advisable to feed ruminants in the early morning (by 8 AM) and then later in the evening (after 5 PM). Since most show animals are on a grain based diet, they tend to devour their feed rather quickly. I also advise feeding a little hay along with the grain to make the rumen full and give the microbes more to work on. Although your project animal will grow more efficiently on grain, an empty rumen is not a good thing. When the rumen is missing feed, the microbes loose their food source and can die out quickly. No microbes, no microbial digestion and no breaking down of feed into useful forms. Keeping some hay available for animals to eat helps keep food in the rumen for the microbes to keep working. A common mistake I have seen are sudden changes in feeding. Sometimes your schedule changes and you may not be able to feed as normal. It is okay to feed a little earlier or later in the morning and at night, but do not feed everything at once. A sudden increase in feed can cause problems from bloat to acidosis. Skipping a feeding is not a good practice either. No matter how late or tired you are, take time to feed. Skipping a feeding leaves and empty stomach and is also not an ethical practice. How would you like to go without a meal just because someone says they do not have time to cook? As you move into summer and begin planning how you are going to stay up late and then sleep in, remember, your ruminants need the consistency. So go feed in your PJs or take a break from your evening fun, and keep those feedings consistent. When we are raising livestock, mud can be both friend and foe. When it has been dry, mud is a sign of some much needed relief. When mud seems to be a constant, it can be a hiding place for a lot of problems. Having the right amount of mud at the right time is what we would like to see. Mud is our friend mostly during the dry and hot times of summer. Mud is one of the most basic ways to maintain or treat dried and cracked hooves on your livestock project. Hooves are made of keratin the same protein that is in our fingernails and toenails. In hot and dry conditions, hooves lacking adequate moisture can begin to crack and split. This cracking and splitting can lead to an open invitation to infections in the hoof and foot. It can also create soreness as the hoof becomes tender. You can use hoof conditioners to treat the dry hooves or you can simply create a little mud. I like to overflow stock tanks and create muddy spots animals must stand in to drink. Animals will come to drink several times a day and standing in the mud can act as a natural hoof conditioner and help to maintain moisture in the hoof. The key is to keep the area slightly muddy where it does not dry out, but not so muddy animals sink in above the hoof. Muddy areas should also be areas free of manure. Muddy manure can invite some pretty nasty bacteria, fungi and viruses to hide and wait to attack a healthy foot. Handling swine can be a bit of an adventure to a first time pig owner and even a bit challenging for those who have raised pigs for several years. Unlike cattle, pigs cannot be easily worked in alleys and chutes. Even goats and sheep can be controlled by hand easier than a pig. Learning to use a few simple tools can make swine handling easier and most of all safe for pigs and people. Moving pigs is usually the first task to learn how to perform and can be done easily using some basic tools. First is using a swine board or sometimes called a sorting board. A swine board is made to be tall enough a pig cannot see over it and wide enough to match at least half of a mature pig's body length. It can be made of wood metal or plastic. Swine boards are used as a portable wall. When moving pigs out of a pen or in an alley way, a swine board visibly blocks off a path of travel for a pig. If the pen or alley is wider than one swine board can block adding another person with a swine board is best. It is best to use the swine board to do one of two things. Swine boards can be carried behind a pig or group of pigs to encourage them to move away from the board and in the direction you want them to travel. Boards can also be used to help stop or turn a pig. By placing a swine board across an alley just past a turn, a pig will naturally walk toward the board, see their path is blocked and usually make the turn you want them to take. Other tools include a paddle, flag, cane or driving stick. These are similar to a show stick and are used to drive a pig in a direction by either blocking their direction of travel or lightly tapping on the opposite side of the body from the direction you want them to travel. As they learn about these items they can then be used as a visual cue and just placing the item in the pig's vision will cue them to turn away from it and travel in the direction you want them to go. When it comes time to restrain a pig to give an injection, draw blood for a vet check, or ear tagging, there are few options. The easiest method is using a snout snare. A snout snare can be either a commercially purchased item or can be homemade. A snout snare works when a pig opens their mouth slightly and the snare is placed around the upper jaw and snout. When it is pulled snug, a pig cannot back out of it and can be secured for tagging, giving an injection or other veterinary procedure. At first look, a snout snare appears to be restricting the pigs ability to breath out of their nose. A properly placed snout snare fits under the upper jaw and over the nasal bone and does not block off any of the pigs nose or nasal passages allowing them to breath normally.","The microbiome is a large population of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract that plays an important role in health maintenance and disease avoidance. It develops in human infants immediately after birth and breast feeding is particularly advantageous because human milk contains various oligosaccharides (HMO) which are prebiotics that support establishment of the microbiome. The microbiome also has multiple effects in locations remote from the gastrointestinal tract. The recognition of the microbiome-gut-brain axis indicates that the microbiome plays a key role in brain functioning. It also influences immune regulation, the endocrine system, and the central nervous system. It is a target for therapeutic intervention for several health problems; gastrointestinal disorders, developmental indices such as cognition, anxiety, mood, and sociability and cancer therapy. Dietary components such as protein, fats, prebiotics, and polyphenols induce shifts in the microbiome. The close relationship between diet, the microbiome, and health suggests that dietary modulation may guide the formation of health promoting microbiomes that could then be maintained throughout the lifespan. Nutrition now needs to be directed towards efficient management of the microbiome since it is well established that an optimal functioning of the microbiome will make a major improvement in health maintenance and disease avoidance. Health maintenance and disease avoidance are clearly important aspects of an active and productive life. It has become evident in recent years that a major factor in maintaining optimal health depends on the proper functioning of our complex gastrointestinal system. Unfortunately, gastrointestinal disorders are very common and encompass more than 40 acute and chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract ranging from common digestive disorders to serious, life-threatening diseases. Digestive diseases, which include gastrointestinal and liver disorders, are common across Europe, causing more than 500 000 deaths in 2008 in the 28 EU member states and more than 900 000 deaths in the whole of Europe, including Russia and other non-EU states [1]. In the USA it is estimated that 8% of the population have chronic digestive diseases, 6% have acute episodes of digestive diseases and 43% have intermittent digestive disorders [2]. Digestive diseases are the second leading cause of disability due to illness in the U.S., with more than 2 million Americans impaired to some degree. The total economic cost associated with digestive diseases has been estimated at more than $50 billion annually. Clearly understanding the gastrointestinal tract and its effective management are crucial for effective health maintenance. Gastrointestinal health is influenced by four major components; namely, the microbiome, the gastrointestinal mucosa, the diet and the interaction with pathogens from the environment. The microbiome is the population of microorganisms which have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. The inner wall of the gastrointestinal tract forms the mucosa which is composed of the digestive epithelium, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and mucus overlying the epithelium. Food ingredients in the diet inevitably interact with and modify the microbiome. The ingestion of food also brings with it the risk of introducing pathogens into the gastrointestinal tract which also interact with the microbiome. It is now well accepted that the microbiome has a major impact upon gastrointestinal health and managing the microbiome is crucial for health maintenance and disease avoidance. It has long been recognised that the gastrointestinal tract contains a very large population of various microorganisms. It includes bacteria, fungi, archae, protozoa and viruses. This population of microorganisms is commonly referred to as the microbiome. This is not strictly correct in that “microbiome” actually refers to the collection of genomes of microorganisms in a system and “microbiota” refers to the collection of microorganisms. However, the term microbiome is commonly used for the microbial population of the gastrointestinal tract and it is so used in this review. The microbiome of course also includes their genomes. The size of the gastrointestinal microbiome is not easy to estimate and for many years was generally considered to be 10 times the number of human cells in the body. However, more recent estimations have substantially reduced this. Within the gastrointestinal tract, the colon is the dominant contributor to the total bacterial population, while the stomach and small intestine make negligible contributions. The colon contains an estimated 3.9 x 1013 bacterial cells. The estimated total cell number of human cells in a 70 kg man is 3.0 x 1013. This gives a bacterial cell: body cell ratio of 1.3 [3]. However, a population of 3.9 x 1013 microorganisms is still an extremely large number and it should not be surprising that the microbiome will exert multiple influences upon human health. Over 90% of the bacteria in the microbiome belong to two phyla (major divisions in classification), Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes. Some of the most commonly found genera of bacteria in the microbiome are; Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Various species of the Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus are generally considered health-promoting, whereas species of Clostridium, Escherichia, Streptococcus and Staphylococcuss can be pathogenic. Therefore, the balance between the different bacterial species has a major impact upon our health. If the normal balance is disturbed we have a condition known as dysbiosis, an imbalance between commensal or harmless microorganisms and pathogenic microorganisms. Although the major species of bacteria in the microbiome are listed above, over 1000 different species have actually been detected by analysis of faecal samples. However, any one individual usually only has about 160 of these species in their microbiome [4]. Clearly the microbiome is an extremely large and complex association of microorganisms. Therefore, it is important for our own health and welfare that the activity of the microbiome is directed towards health maintenance and disease avoidance. The population of microorganisms in the microbiome produces a vast range of products. Fermentation of fibre and protein by bacteria in the large bowel produces short chain fatty acids, acetate, propionate and butyrate, which act as key sources of energy for colorectal tissues and maintain tissue integrity. Short chain fatty acids are also absorbed into the bloodstream and impact immune function and inflammation in tissues such as the lung. However, some protein fermentation products such as ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide can also be toxic. Bifidobacterium can generate vitamins such as K, B12, Biotin, Folate, Thiamine [5]. Synthesis of secondary bile acids, important components of lipid transport and turnover in humans, is mediated via bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Numerous bioactive lipids are produced by bacteria, including lipopolysaccharide, a component of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria that can cause tissue inflammation. In addition to the synthesis of many compounds, the genes in the microbiome allow the production of many enzymes which our own body cells cannot produce. This supply of extra enzymes influences digestion and health. Indeed, much of the microbial diversity in the human gastrointestinal tract may be attributed to the spectrum of microbial enzymatic capacity needed to degrade nutrients, particularly the many forms of complex polysaccharides that are consumed by humans and are not digested in the small intestine. The Bacteroidetes are specialized in the breakdown of complex plant polysaccharides and so the introduction of plant derived carbohydrates into the diet would boost populations of Bacteroidetes [6]. On the other hand, low levels of Bacteroidetes in the microbiome are correlated with obesity, which itself may result from a diet low in plant-derived polysaccharides. Bacterial phytases of the colon degrade phytic acid present in grains, releasing minerals such as calcium, magnesium and phosphate and making these available to host tissues. Enzymes which degrade mucins help bacteria meet their energy needs and assist in the normal turnover of the mucus barrier lining the gastrointestinal tract [7]. An important characteristic of the microbiome is the great diversity among individuals. This is much greater than the genomic variation of the body. Individual humans are about 99.9% identical to one another in terms of their host genome, but can be 80-90% different from one another in terms of the gastrointestinal microbiome. This suggests that exploiting the variation contained within the microbiome will be much more fruitful in personalized medicine than the use of an individual patient's genetic data that targets the relatively constant host genome [8]. In view of the multiple effects of the microbiome in health and disease, it is important that a beneficial microbiome is rapidly established in the young infant. Although gastrointestinal bacterial colonization begins when a foetus is in the lower uterus, an infant's microbiome is only fully established after birth. A major factor contributing to the variation in the infant microbiome is the mode of delivery at birth. Infants born vaginally have a microbiome very similar to that of their mother’s vaginal and faecal microflora. This occurs through vertical transfer of the vaginal-perianal microbes of the mother as the infant passes through the birth canal. For vaginally-born infants, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp. dominates the microbiome but within months there is a greater distribution of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides [9]. In contrast, the microbiome of an infant born by caesarean section comprises bacteria transferred horizontally from the mother’s and others’ skin surfaces and, to a lesser extent, the place of birth. This tends to result in an infant microbiome dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria, and Propionibacterium spp. with lower proportions of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides spp. These differences in initial new-born microbiomes may have important health consequences since the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are considered to be health protective whereas some Staphylococcus and Clostridium spp. have pathogenic potential. In addition to differences in bacterial genera, the intestinal microbiome of infants born surgically shows less diversity compared to vaginally delivered infants. This is potentially important since, in general, increased diversity of microbes within the gastrointestinal tract is considered protective, while low diversity has been linked to a variety of human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. Thus, delivery mode appears to be an important factor in the development of the infant microbiome, since surgically delivered infants miss the unique opportunity to be inculcated with their mother’s vaginal microbiome via the birth canal. The microbiome starts to assemble immediately after birth, and during the first year of life, the infant diet is one of the most important factors that shape the microbiome. The influence of diet on microbiome development is clearly illustrated in infants with different feeding routines, namely breast milk feeding and formula feeding. Breast milk feeding promotes infant health by guiding the proper assembly and activity of the gut microbiome [10]. This is an important benefit from breast milk since inadequate colonization during early childhood may lead to dysbiosis (or an imbalance between commensal and pathogenic organisms) which may increase susceptibility to a variety of immune-related pathogenic states [9]. The benefit of breast feeding is related to the quality of human milk which  contains proteins, fats, carbohydrates and various immunoglobulins. The carbohydrate fraction of human milk comprises between 5 and 23 g/L of specific oligosaccharides containing a lactose-reducing end elongated with fucosylated and/or sialylated N-acetyllactosamine units. The human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are the third most abundant components in milk after lactose and lipids and they are composed of various monosaccharides namely, glucose, galactose, fucose, N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylglucosamine [11]. Infants lack the enzymes necessary to digest HMO so most reach the colon unmodified where they can influence the development of the microbiome. In the colon they are fermented, mainly by Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes species, to produce short-chain fatty acids. Only a few Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species can use HMO as the sole carbon source. Therefore, HMOs have a clear prebiotic effect by selectively stimulating the development of a Bifidobacterium-rich and Bacteriodes-rich microbiome. In addition, HMO is also considered as anti-adhesive antimicrobials [12]. To colonize or invade host cells most bacterial, viral or protozoan pathogens need to adhere to carbohydrate structures or receptors on the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Various HMO resemble these receptor structures and act as decoys when the pathogenic microorganisms bind to the HMO instead of the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. This reduces the risk of viral or bacterial infections since the pathogens are excreted together with the undigested HMO. Formula-fed infants lack the benefits of HMO and exhibit a microbiome with a significant presence of species of Staphylococcus, anaerobic Streptococcus, and Clostridium in addition to Bifidobacterium. Some studies have shown that exclusively formula-fed infants are more often colonized with E. coli, C. difficile, B. fragilis group, and Lactobacilli than those that are exclusively breast-fed. Recently, milk formulas have been improved, notably by the inclusion of some HMO, which makes it possible for a formula-fed infant to establish a Bifidobacterium-rich microbiome. However, compared with breast-fed infants, formula-fed infants still have distinctive features of their microbiome such as the over representation of C. difficile [13]. During lactation, the microbiome is predominantly comprised of Bifidobacterium. At the onset of the weaning period, with the introduction of solid foods and the continuation of breast milk feeding, an adult-type complex microbiome dominated by the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes becomes established. At about three years of age humans acquire a stable microbiome dominated by Bacteroides, Prevotella, and other Firmicutes. In a normal, healthy individual, the gastrointestinal tract has a microbiome populated by a diverse array of microorganisms which display immune homeostasis marked by oral tolerance to commensal bacteria and benign antigens. The microbiome in adults is relatively stable from 20 to 75 years old. In elderly people the microbiome changes. Though both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are dominant in the adult and elderly microbiome, distinct changes occur in the Firmicutes subgroups, with multiple members in this phylum decreasing in number with increasing age. Conversely, there is an increase in the proportions of facultative anaerobes, such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus, and Proteobacteria such as E. coli in older age. Bifidobacteria decrease in the elderly, a strain considered to be an important probiotic with functions in maintaining microbiome homeostasis and preventing pathogenic infection. In humans, diet plays a primary role in generating compositional change and diversity in the microbiome as dietary patterns progress over the first three years of life. Major shifts in the taxonomic groups of the microbiome have been observed with changes in diet such as weaning to solid foods. The introduction of table food to the breast-fed infant causes a rapid rise in the number of enterobacteria and enterococci, followed by progressive colonization by Bacteroides spp., Clostridium, and anaerobic Streptococcus. In formula-fed infants, however, the transition to solid food does not have as great an impact on gastrointestinal flora. As the amount of solid food in the diet increases, the bacterial flora of both breast- and formula-fed babies approach that of adults with a co-dominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and a more stable community composition [14]. Dietary alterations can induce large, temporary microbial shifts within 24 h [15]. Therefore, it is important that an appropriate diet is available throughout life to ensure adequate development and maintenance of the microbiome. In the adult the microbiome has the ability to breakdown plant polysaccharides and xenobiotic compounds as well as vitamin biosynthesis. The Bacteroidetes are specialized in the breakdown of complex plant polysaccharides and so the introduction of plant derived carbohydrates into the diet would boost populations of Bacteroidetes. Consistent with these observations, low levels of Bacteroidetes in the microbiome are correlated with obesity, which itself may result from a diet low in plant-derived polysaccharides. Thus, together these results further support the notion that a diet high in plant material promotes a microbial community structure and metabolite production that is beneﬁcial to the human host [14]. Short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products rapidly alter the microbiome. A diet based on foods of animal origin increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). In a study of 98 individuals there was an association between Bacteroides enterotypes and high animal fat or protein diets, while the Prevotella enterotype was associated with a high carbohydrate diet [16]. A high-saturated fat diet seems to increase counts of total anaerobic microflora and the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Bilophila [15]. Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting the comparison of carbohydrate and protein fermentation. These results demonstrated that the microbiome rapidly responds to an altered diet. Prebiotics are interesting candidates to support the microbiome. These are non-digestible food ingredients that have a beneficial effect on the microbiome, through their selective metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract [17]. As discussed above HMO act as prebiotics and are not utilised for growth of the body but play an important role in establishing an effective microbiome in infants. Prebiotics have an enormous potential for modifying the microbiome [18]. Fruit, vegetables, cereals, and other edible plants are sources of carbohydrates constituting potential prebiotics. There is a wide range of commercially produced prebiotics such as; beta-glucans, cyclodextrins, fructooligosaccharides and inulin, galactooligosaccharides, lactulose and maltooligosaccharides. The prebiotics can selectively support the growth of gastrointestinal bacteria, promote immune functions and show anti-viral activity. Some of them are able to promote mineral absorption and regulate metabolism. Supporting the microbiome is another and possibly neglected aspect of human nutrition. Generally good nutrition is directed towards fulfilling requirements for protein, energy, vitamins and minerals in terms of growth of the body. However, nutrition also now needs to be directed towards efficient management of the microbiome as this has an overriding effect upon health maintenance and disease avoidance. In the future we need to ensure that nutrition supplies nutrients for the human body and also supplies adequate nutrients for the microbiome. Starting from birth the gastrointestinal microbiome is of fundamental importance for human and animal health because it helps in maintaining homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. The microbiome serves as a barrier against the proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms. It plays an important role in the digestion and metabolism of colostrum, breast milk, formula, and weaning foods in infants, and a wide variety of foods in adults. It is also active in the breakdown of toxins and drugs, in vitamin synthesis and in ion absorption. The microbiome produces immunomodulatory metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and is important in maintaining the immune system including tolerance to food antigens. Short chain fatty acid such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate also act as a major energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and may therefore strengthen the mucosal barrier. Moreover, the gastrointestinal microbiome allows the synthesis of beneﬁcial nutrients such as vitamins [5]. It is also involved in protein catabolism. The microbiome in the colon is a site of heavy proteolytic activity since it receives around 12–18 g proteins every day. The proteolytic activity in colon has been mainly attributed to the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Propionibacterium, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus [19]. As previously discussed enzymes from the microbiome also improves energy harvest from dietary components with low inherent potential such as complex carbohydrates and phytic acid. The microbiome has profound effects on the development and physiology of the host immune system in early life and affects health and disease in later life. The development of a microbiome is necessary for normal immune system development, as indicated by the loss of immune function in germ-free mice [20]. Several of the metabolites produced by the microbiome also stimulate the neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract and therefore, the microbiome plays an important role in the endocrine regulation of gastrointestinal functionality. Therefore, the microbiome contributes to the regulation of the host homeostasis by contributing to optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients, regulation of energy metabolism, prevention of mucosal infections, modulation of the immune system and endocrine regulation [21]. Numerous diseases in both adults and infants have links to the microbiome, including stomach cancer, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and necrotizing enterocolitis. Disruption of the microbiome in young mice leads to long-term changes in visceral pain perception, characteristic of stress-related disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome [22]. Various studies across different animal species have reported changes in microbial communities in acute and chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The most commonly observed changes are decreases in the bacterial phyla Firmicutes (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium) and Bacteroidetes, with concurrent increases in Proteobacteria (e.g., E. coli). However, it is now evident that the microbiome not only influences events in the gastrointestinal tract but also has a long-distance effect exerting an influence remote from the gastrointestinal tract as far as the brain. Whilst the ability of the brain to regulate the function of the gastrointestinal tract has long been recognized, only in the last decade has the bidirectional nature of this relationship been elucidated. It is now recognised that the microbiome influences the function of the brain and central nervous system through metabolic, neuroendocrine and immune systems and impacts upon cognitive development [23,24]. This has led to a relatively new concept of the presence of a pathway of communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, modulated by the microbiome. This has given rise to the term “microbiota-gut-brain” axis. This concept attributes functions to the microbiome to modulate brain plasticity and influence early development of normal social and cognitive behaviours such as learning and memory. Management of the microbiome by dietary means now has the potential to improve both the physical and emotional well-being in humans. It also offers the possibility as a treatment for conditions as diverse as irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, depression and Alzheimer’s disease [25]. Another important function of the microbiome may be in cancer therapy. Bacteria are known to modulate the anti-tumour efficacy of various chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents [26]. In a clinical trial, patients that responded to an anti-cancer therapy had a high abundance of Faecalibacterium genus in the microbiome. Non-responding patients however displayed a high abundance of Bacteriodales in their microbiome [27]. These results suggest that the microbiome may modulate responses to an anti-cancer immunotherapy in melanoma patients. There may well be a therapeutic advantage in modulating the microbiome of patients receiving an ant-cancer immunotherapy. Obviously, a healthy microbiome is desirable but definition and measurement of health is difficult. Commonly health is defined as the absence of disease. Also, although many studies of the microbiome focus on disease, a better understanding of the healthy microbiome would it help to develop new microbiome diagnostics and therapeutics [28]. Enrichment of the infant microbiome in species such as Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are proven determinants of a healthy microbiome. Once established, these are the main producers of short chain fatty acids which are an important source of energy from non-digestible carbohydrates. Many plant foods are rich in non-digestible carbohydrates so the microbiome plays an important role in helping utilization of these food components. The short chain fatty acids are valuable compounds as they are immunomodulatory, inhibit common pathogens, and may possess tumour-suppressive properties. Development of the microbiome is an essential requirement for immune system education and the establishment of these beneficial genera early in life promotes immune tolerance and can consequently attenuate or abrogate autoimmune diseases [28]. An important parameter of a healthy microbiome is stability which incorporates resistance and resilience [29]. Stability depends upon the ability of the microbiome to resist change in response to stress (resistance) or to return to an equilibrium state following a stress-related perturbation (resilience). For example, a healthy microbiome has the ability to resist perturbations due to the entry of a pathogen, alteration of the diet, or administration of medication such as antibiotics and to return to a healthy state afterwards. After an antibiotic treatment, the healthy microbiome generally recovers to its previous state after a few weeks. The ability of the human microbiome to remain stable in the face of continuous and potentially  disruptive perturbations is important for health maintenance and disease avoidance. High diversity of the population in the microbiome has also been generally associated with good health. Conversely, a relative lack of diversity is apparent in the microbiome in diseases ranging from obesity to inflammatory bowel disease and types 1 and 2 diabetes. Antibiotics also cause a drastic reduction in the diversity of the microbiome which will impair its ability to exclude pathogens. Disruption of the microbiome by antibiotics is frequently associated with diarrhoea, altered gastrointestinal physiology, and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism. This can put an individual at risk for developing infections from an opportunistic pathogen, such as C. difficile or C. albicans. Antibiotic use in low-birth-weight neonates can contribute to the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis, a disease in which microbial dysbiosis is considered to directly contribute to disease onset. Likewise, epidemiologic studies link multiple courses of antibiotics in early childhood with increased risk of Crohn’s disease. From animal studies, it is known that different microbial populations can dramatically affect susceptibility to chronic inflammation. The presence of microorganisms that convert compounds in the gastrointestinal lumen into potential carcinogens is an increased risk for cancer and can lead to adverse responses to chemotherapeutic agents. The lack of sufficient diversity in the microbiome appears to diminish its ability to withstand perturbation. Individuals with a reduced diversity in the microbiome may be more susceptible to developing different diseases [29]. Thus, the resistance of a microbiome to stress and perturbation and its ability to recover to a healthy functional profile afterwards are among the potential properties that characterize a healthy microbiome. If the universal features of the healthy microbiome could be defined, then their absence may be a useful predictor of disease onset. The complete microbiome could be monitored for health maintenance or departures into disease. This would make it possible to determine the appropriate interventions to restore health after dysbiosis, ranging from dietary or lifestyle changes through prebiotics, probiotics or microbially targeted pharmaceuticals [28]. The microbiome is a very large population of microorganisms located in the gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the colon. The number of bacteria in the microbiome is probably greater than the total number of cells in the body and plays an important role in health maintenance and disease avoidance. The microbiome develops in the human infant immediately after birth and is initially influenced by the birth process, vaginal birth or caesarean section. Further development of the microbiome depends upon the nutrition of the infant. Breast feeding supplies HMO which help establish an effective microbiome. Formula fed infants lack this advantage. The microbiome has multiple effects and interacts with immune regulation, the endocrine system, the brain and the central nervous system (Figure 1). Figure 1: Gastrointestinal microbiome and gut-brain-axis. This has led to the development of concept of microbiome-gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests the microbiome plays a key role in brain functioning, ranging from cognition to anxiety, mood, and sociability. It is remarkable that the microbiome can exert effects in locations remote from the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the microbiome is a target for therapeutic intervention for several health problems, ranging from various gastrointestinal disorders, a range of developmental indices from cognition to anxiety, mood, and sociability and cancer therapy. Dietary components such as protein, fats, digestible and non-digestible carbohydrates, prebiotics, and polyphenols all induce shifts in the microbiome. The close relationship between diet, the microbiome, and health suggests that dietary modulation of the microbiome may guide the formation of health promoting microbiomes that could then be maintained throughout the lifespan. Therefore, nutrition also now needs to be directed towards efficient management of the microbiome. In the future we need to consider nutrition as a supply of nutrients for the human body and also as a supply of nutrients for the microbiome. It is well established that an optimal functioning of the microbiome will make a major improvement in health maintenance and disease avoidance.

why is the tour de france regarded a global event,"The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper L'Auto; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity, the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.","In sports, a stage, or leg, or heat, is a unit of a race which has been divided in several parts for the reason such as length of the distance to be covered, as in a multi-day event. Usually, such a race consists of ""ordinary"" stages, but sometimes stages are held as an individual time trial or a team time trial. Long races such as the Tour de France, Absa Cape Epic or the Giro d'Italia are known for their stages of one day each, whereas the boat sailing VELUX 5 Oceans Race is broken down in usually four stages of several weeks duration each, where the competitors are racing continuously day and night. In bicycling and running events, a race with stages is known as a stage race. The Tour de France is an annual men's multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally passing through nearby countries. Like the other Grand Tours, it consists of 21 day-long stages over the course of 23 days. The 2019 Tour de France was the 106th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three grand tours. The 3,480 km (2,162 mi)-long race consisted of 21 stages, starting on 6 July in Brussels, Belgium, and concluding on 28 July with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris. The opening stages of the Tour were held in Brussels in honour of the 50th anniversary of the first Tour de France win of Eddy Merckx. A total of 176 riders from 22 teams participated in the race. The overall general classification was won by Egan Bernal of Team Ineos who, at age 22, became the third-youngest all time winner of the Tour de France and the youngest ever winner of the yellow jersey. He is also the first Colombian and Latin American winner of the Tour de France. Teammate Geraint Thomas finished second while Steven Kruijswijk came in third. The Dutch Headwind Cycling Championships are the annually open Dutch cycling time trial Championships by storm. Taking place on the Oosterscheldekering storm barrier the championships are held at the end of the year since 2013 and faces out on to the North Sea. Competitors must ride the 8.5 km course against the wind on upright single-speed bikes, which are delivered by the organization. The championships are announced three days before storm is expected. Since 2014 there is also a team time trial. A total of 200 individual cyclists could participate and 25 teams of four cyclists. Participants start 30 seconds apart from each other and the one with the fastest time wins. The Invictus Games is an international adaptive multi-sport event, created by Prince Harry, in which wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and their associated veterans take part in sports including wheelchair basketball, sitting volleyball, and indoor rowing. Named after Invictus, Latin for ""unconquered"" or ""undefeated"", the event was inspired by the Warrior Games, a similar event held in the United States. The first Invictus Games took place in March 2014 at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, United Kingdom. The Tour de Langkawi is a multiple stage bicycle race held in Malaysia. It is named after the archipelago Langkawi, where the first edition started and finished. The race has been held annually since 1996, primarily in the month of February. It usually consists of 10-day-long segments (stages) over 10 days, but has been reduced to eight stages over recent years. While the route changes each year, the Genting Highlands climb, the toughest in the tour, is always included. Tour de Langkawi is sanctioned by the International Cycling Union (UCI) as a 2.HC road race in the UCI Asia Tour calendar. The UCI World Tour is the premier men's elite road cycling tour, sitting above the various regional UCI Continental Circuits. It refers to both the tour of 37 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these. The World Ranking was launched in 2009, and merged fully with its predecessor the UCI ProTour in 2011. UCI WorldTeams must compete at all rounds of the tour. The Giro d'Italia is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also occasionally passing through nearby countries. The first race was organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport; however it is currently run by RCS Sport. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except when it was stopped for the two world wars. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world. The Giro is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI ProTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers can invite. In road bicycle racing, a Grand Tour is one of the three major European professional cycling stage races: Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España. Collectively they are termed the Grand Tours, and all three races are similar in format being multi-week races with daily stages. They have a special status in the UCI regulations: more points for the UCI World Tour are distributed in Grand Tours than in other races, and they are the only stage races allowed to last longer than 14 days. Cycling has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics, at which a road race and five track events were held. Mountain bike racing entered the Olympic programme at the Atlanta Olympics, followed by BMX racing in 2008. Prior to the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics, all events were speed races, but the 2020 programme will feature BMX freestyle for the first time. The 2018 Tour de France was the 105th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three Grand Tours. The 3,351 km (2,082 mi) race started from Noirmoutier-en-l'Île, in the Vendée department, on 7 July and concluded with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris, on 29 July. A total of 176 riders across 22 teams were participating in the 21-stage race. The Tour was the shortest of the millennium and was the fifth time a tour had set out from Vendée. The race was won for the first time by Geraint Thomas of Team Sky. Tom Dumoulin placed second, with Thomas' teammate and four-time Tour champion Chris Froome coming third. The Vuelta a España is an annual multi-stage bicycle race primarily held in Spain, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. Inspired by the success of the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, the race was first organized in 1935. The race was prevented from being run by the Spanish Civil War and World War II in the early years of its existence; however, the race has been held annually since 1955. As the Vuelta gained prestige and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend all around the globe. Since 1979, the event has been staged and managed by Unipublic, until in 2014, when Amaury Sport Organisation acquired control, with both working together. The peloton expanded from a primarily Spanish participation to include riders from all over the world. The Vuelta is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI ProTeams, with the exception of the wild card teams that the organizers can invite. The Mediterranean Games are a multi-sport games held usually every four years, between nations around or very close to the Mediterranean Sea, where Europe, Africa, and Asia meet. The games are under the auspices of the International Committee of Mediterranean Games (CIJM). A criterium, or crit, is a bike race consisting of several laps around a closed circuit, the length of each lap or circuit ranging from about 800 m to 10,000 m. Milan–San Remo, also called ""The Spring classic"" or ""La Classicissima"", is an annual cycling race between Milan and Sanremo, in Northwest Italy. With a distance of 298 km it is the longest professional one-day race in modern cycling. It is the first major classic race of the season, usually held on the third Saturday of March. The first edition was held in 1907.",,,,,,,,,
why two different elements cannot occupy the same box in the periodic table,"The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle which states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously. In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: n, the principal quantum number, l, the angular momentum quantum number, m, the magnetic quantum number, and m, the spin quantum number. For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, and if their n, l, and m values are the same, then their m must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spin projections of 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin -- statistics theorem of 1940.","Above, Big Apple Corner at 54th Street and Broadway in Manhattan.

Many general rules are taken into consideration when assigning the ""location"" of the electron to its prospective energy state, however these assignments are arbitrary and it is always uncertain as to which electron is being described. Knowing the electron configuration of a species gives us a better understanding of its bonding ability, magnetism and other chemical properties. The electron configuration is the standard notation used to describe the electronic structure of an atom. Under the orbital approximation, we let each electron occupy an orbital, which can be solved by a single wavefunction. In doing so, we obtain three quantum numbers (n,l,ml), which are the same as the ones obtained from solving the Schrödinger's equation for Bohr's hydrogen atom. Hence, many of the rules that we use to describe the electron's address in the hydrogen atom can also be used in systems involving multiple electrons. When assigning electrons to orbitals, we must follow a set of three rules: the Aufbau Principle, the Pauli-Exclusion Principle, and Hund's Rule. The wavefunction is the solution to the Schrödinger equation. By solving the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom, we obtain three quantum numbers, namely the principal quantum number (n), the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l), and the magnetic quantum number (ml). There is a fourth quantum number, called the spin magnetic quantum number (ms), which is not obtained from solving the Schrödinger equation. Together, these four quantum numbers can be used to describe the location of an electron in Bohr's hydrogen atom. These numbers can be thought of as an electron's ""address"" in the atom. To help describe the appropriate notation for electron configuration, it is best to do so through example. For this example, we will use the iodine atom. There are two ways in which electron configuration can be written: In both of these types of notations, the order of the energy levels must be written by increased energy, showing the number of electrons in each subshell as an exponent. In the short notation, you place brackets around the preceding noble gas element followed by the valence shell electron configuration. The periodic table shows that kyrpton (Kr) is the previous noble gas listed before iodine. The noble gas configuration encompases the energy states lower than the valence shell electrons. Therefore, in this case [Kr]=1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p6. The principal quantum number n indicates the shell or energy level in which the electron is found. The value of n can be set between 1 to n, where n is the value of the outermost shell containing an electron. This quantum number can only be positive, non-zero, and integer values. That is, n=1,2,3,4,.. For example, an Iodine atom has its outmost electrons in the 5p orbital. Therefore, the principle quantum number for Iodine is 5. The orbital angular momentum quantum number, l, indicates the subshell of the electron. You can also tell the shape of the atomic orbital with this quantum number. An s subshell corresponds to l=0, a p subshell = 1, a d subshell = 2, a f subshell = 3, and so forth. This quantum number can only be positive and integer values, although it can take on a zero value. In general, for every value of n, there are n values of l. Furthermore, the value of l ranges from 0 to n-1. For example, if n=3, l=0,1,2. So in regards to the example used above, the l values of Iodine for n = 5 are l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The magnetic quantum number, ml, represents the orbitals of a given subshell. For a given l, ml can range from -l to +l. A p subshell (l=1), for instance, can have three orbitals corresponding to ml = -1, 0, +1. In other words, it defines the px, py and pzorbitals of the p subshell. (However, the ml numbers don't necessarily correspond to a given orbital. The fact that there are three orbitals simply is indicative of the three orbitals of a p subshell.) In general, for a given l, there are 2l+1 possible values for ml; and in a n principal shell, there are n2 orbitals found in that energy level. Continuing on from out example from above, the ml values of Iodine are ml = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 1, 2, 3, 4. These arbitrarily correspond to the 5s, 5px, 5py, 5pz, 4dx2-y2, 4dz2, 4dxy, 4dxz, and 4dyz orbitals. The spin magnetic quantum number can only have a value of either +1/2 or -1/2. The value of 1/2 is the spin quantum number, s, which describes the electron's spin. Due to the spinning of the electron, it generates a magnetic field. In general, an electron with a ms=+1/2 is called ­­an alpha electron, and one with a ­ms=-1/2 is called a beta electron. No two paired electrons can have the same spin value. Out of these four quantum numbers, however, Bohr postulated that only the principal quantum number, n, determines the energy of the electron. Therefore, the 3s orbital (l=0) has the same energy as the 3p (l=1) and 3d (l=2) orbitals, regardless of a difference in l values. This postulate, however, holds true only for Bohr's hydrogen atom or other hydrogen-like atoms. When dealing with multi-electron systems, we must consider the electron-electron interactions. Hence, the previously described postulate breaks down in that the energy of the electron is now determined by both the principal quantum number, n, and the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l. Although the Schrödinger equation for many-electron atoms is extremely difficult to solve mathematically, we can still describe their electronic structures via electron configurations. There are a set of general rules that are used to figure out the electron configuration of an atomic species: Aufbau Principle, Hund's Rule and the Pauli-Exclusion Principle. Before continuing, it's important to understand that each orbital can be occupied by two electrons of opposite spin (which will be further discussed later). The following table shows the possible number of electrons that can occupy each orbital in a given subshell. Using our example, iodine, again, we see on the periodic table that its atomic number is 53 (meaning it contains 53 electrons in its neutral state). Its complete electron configuration is 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p5. If you count up all of these electrons, you will see that it adds up to 53 electrons. Notice that each subshell can only contain the max amount of electrons as indicated in the table above. The word 'Aufbau' is German for 'building up'. The Aufbau Principle, also called the building-up principle, states that electron's occupy orbitals in order of increasing energy. The order of occupation is as follows: This order of occupation roughly represents the increasing energy level of the orbitals. Hence, electrons occupy the orbitals in such a way that the energy is kept at a minimum. That is, the 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p subshells will not be filled with electrons unless the lower energy orbitals, 1s to 6p, are already fully occupied. Also, it is important to note that although the energy of the 3d orbital has been mathematically shown to be lower than that of the 4s orbital, electrons occupy the 4s orbital first before the 3d orbital. This observation can be ascribed to the fact that 3d electrons are more likely to be found closer to the nucleus; hence, they repel each other more strongly. Nonetheless, remembering the order of orbital energies, and hence assigning electrons to orbitals, can become rather easy when related to the periodic table. To understand this principle, let's consider the bromine atom. Bromine (Z=35), which has 35 electrons, can be found in Period 4, Group VII of the periodic table. Since bromine has 7 valence electrons, the 4s orbital will be completely filled with 2 electrons, and the remaining five electrons will occupy the 4p orbital. Hence the full or expanded electronic configuration for bromine in accord with the Aufbau Principle is 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p5. If we add the exponents, we get a total of 35 electrons, confirming that our notation is correct. Hund's Rule states that when electrons occupy degenerate orbitals (i.e. same n and l quantum numbers), they must first occupy the empty orbitals before double occupying them. Furthermore, the most stable configuration results when the spins are parallel (i.e. all alpha electrons or all beta electrons). Nitrogen, for example, has 3 electrons occupying the 2p orbital. According to Hund's Rule, they must first occupy each of the three degenerate p orbitals, namely the 2px orbital, 2py orbital, and the 2pz orbital, and with parallel spins (Figure 2). The configuration below is incorrect because the third electron occupies does not occupy the empty 2pz orbital. Instead, it occupies the half-filled 2px orbital. This, therefore, is a violation of Hund's Rule (Figure 2). Wolfgang Pauli postulated that each electron can be described with a unique set of four quantum numbers. Therefore, if two electrons occupy the same orbital, such as the 3s orbital, their spins must be paired. Although they have the same principal quantum number (n=3), the same orbital angular momentum quantum number (l=0), and the same magnetic quantum number (ml=0), they have different spin magnetic quantum numbers (ms=+1/2 and ms=-1/2). The way we designate electronic configurations for cations and anions is essentially similar to that for neutral atoms in their ground state. That is, we follow the three important rules: Aufbau Principle, Pauli-exclusion Principle, and Hund's Rule. The electronic configuration of cations is assigned by removing electrons first in the outermost p orbital, followed by the s orbital and finally the d orbitals (if any more electrons need to be removed). For instance, the ground state electronic configuration of calcium (Z=20) is 1s22s22p63s23p64s2. The calcium ion (Ca2+), however, has two electrons less. Hence, the electron configuration for Ca2+ is 1s22s22p63s23p6. Since we need to take away two electrons, we first remove electrons from the outermost shell (n=4). In this case, all the 4p subshells are empty; hence, we start by removing from the s orbital, which is the 4s orbital. The electron configuration for Ca2+ is the same as that for Argon, which has 18 electrons. Hence, we can say that both are isoelectronic. The electronic configuration of anions is assigned by adding electrons according to Aufbau Principle. We add electrons to fill the outermost orbital that is occupied, and then add more electrons to the next higher orbital. The neutral atom chlorine (Z=17), for instance has 17 electrons. Therefore, its ground state electronic configuration can be written as 1s22s22p63s23p5. The chloride ion (Cl-), on the other hand, has an additional electron for a total of 18 electrons. Following Aufbau Principle, the electron occupies the partially filled 3p subshell first, making the 3p orbital completely filled. The electronic configuration for Cl- can, therefore, be designated as 1s22s22p63s23p6. Again, the electron configuration for the chloride ion is the same as that for Ca2+ and Argon. Hence, they are all isoelectronic to each other. 1. Which of the princples explained above tells us that electrons that are paired cannot have the same spin value? 2.

These numbers, as their name suggest, are heavily influenced by quantum mechanics, a branch of physics that deals with the movement and behavior of subatomic particles. There are four of these numbers – the principal quantum number, the angular momentum quantum number (also known as the orbital quantum number), the magnetic quantum number, and the electron spin quantum number. Each of these quantum numbers cover a quantum mechanical principle, and, together, forms the basis of the branch. These quantum numbers also define electron configurations – an important concept in chemistry. These configurations define how an electron is distributed within an atom. In terms of quantum numbers, the electron configuration represents the amount of electrons that can fill an element. The most stable elements – the noble gases – have the maximum amount of electrons allowed by their quantum numbers. Both the electron configuration and the quantum numbers of elements are determined by the energy that electrons have. The electrons with the lowest energy which are closest to the nucleus are referred to as core electrons while those with the highest energy are labeled valence electrons and are used to increase atomic stability through chemical bonding. The Principal Quantum Number, represented by the letter n, is used to define the energy level of the electron in any atom. In chemistry, the electron’s energy level is also referred to as the energy shell. As previously stated, the core electron shell is that with the lowest energy and, therefore, would have a lower principal number. Since atoms have a tendency to fill their lowest energy shells first, the lowest principal numbers are where we start. The electron shells are labeled in two ways – alphabetically from the letter K to O or numerically from the letter 1 to 5. These are equivalent; K is the same as 1 and O is the same as 5. Typically, this quantum number is represented numerically instead of alphabetically. Although there is the chance that higher principal quantum numbers may be used, n = 1 to n = 5 are the most common range. The Angular Momentum Quantum Number, represented by the letter l, is also called the Orbital Quantum Number because it determines the path or area that the electron travels within, which we define as an orbital in chemistry. Orbitals are governed by an electron’s angular momentum, which is the physical product of an electron’s moment of inertia and its angular velocity. In spite of this, it is important to note that calculating the angular momentum of an electron cannot be done conventionally because the electron exhibits wave-particle duality, which is the nature of a particle to behave like both a waveform and a particle. As such, the angular momentum in a quantum mechanical sense is often referred to as the quantized angular momentum. Regardless, the angular momentum quantum number, l, is also represented both numerically – commonly by an integer value from 0 to 3 – or alphabetically – with the letters s, p, d and f, respectively. Unlike the principal number’s convention, this quantum number is typically referenced with its letters. As with the principal quantum number, the value of l can be greater than the commonly used range, however the elements that correspond to greater l values have not yet been discovered. Moreover, the orbital quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number in that l must always be one less than n. In other words, the orbital quantum number can only go up to n – 1. This means that if there is a principal quantum number of 2, the orbital quantum number is equal to 1. The result of that is that the highest orbital in the element is a p orbital. That, however, does not mean that all electrons are within the p orbital. Remember, electrons prefer to fill the lowest energy shells before moving to the next one, meaning an l of 1 means that there are electrons both in the s and p orbitals. It is because of this that when a principal quantum number is given, the value of l given is usually the range of possible values; n = 2 corresponds to l = 0, 1. While the principal quantum number tells you how many electrons are contained within the atom, the orbital quantum number will tell you how they are organized within each electron shell. Therefore, this quantum number defines the electron “subshell”. Every electron within the same subshell contains the exact same level of energy, and, just like with electron shells, the higher subshells contain more energy than lower subshells. With an increase in the number of electrons comes an increase in the amount of orbitals and how they must be oriented to maintain the lowest possible energy within an atom. The magnetic quantum number, represented by the letter m, provides a value to this orientation. Keep in mind, however, that since this depends upon the number of subshells, it is limited by the angular momentum quantum number. That said, m is equal to the range of -l to l. So, for example, if there are two subshells, represented by l = 1, the value of m is 3 (-1, 0, and 1).  This means that there are 3 orbital orientations in the highest subshell. In order to find the total value of m, however, you must remember that an l of 1 includes l = 0. In that case, m is equal to 1, making the total amount of orientations in this element 4. The spin quantum number, or s, is the final quantum number and is also the only quantum number that has no dependence on any of the other quantum numbers, but instead depends on the quantum mechanical properties of electrons themselves. This number determines the number of electrons within any given orbital orientation, as per an important quantum mechanical principle – the Pauli Exclusion Principle. It states that two electrons cannot have the exact same quantum mechanical state. This state is according to a quality that electrons have called “spin” (the electrons do not literally spin, this is just a name) which is either defined as +1/2 or -1/2. In one orbital orientation, according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, there cannot be two electrons with the same spin. Therefore, the spin quantum number dictates that there is a limit of two electrons, one with one spin and one with the other, in any given orientation. The amount of electrons in any given element is represented with a 1 or 2 in exponent form on the angular quantum number, representing if that element has one or two electrons in that subshell. 1. What do quantum numbers do? 2. What does an element having a principal quantum number of 2 mean? 3. How many orbitals does an element have if it has an l value of 2? 4.

The combination of all quantum numbers of all electrons in an atom is described by a wave function that complies with the Schrödinger equation. Each electron in an atom has a unique set of quantum numbers; according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two electrons can share the same combination of four quantum numbers. Quantum numbers are important because they can be used to determine the electron configuration of an atom and the probable location of the atom's electrons. Quantum numbers are also used to understand other characteristics of atoms, such as ionization energy and the atomic radius. In atoms, there are a total of four quantum numbers: the principal quantum number (n), the orbital angular momentum quantum number (l), the magnetic quantum number (ml), and the electron spin quantum number (ms). The principal quantum number, \(n\), describes the energy of an electron and the most probable distance of the electron from the nucleus. In other words, it refers to the size of the orbital and the energy level an electron is placed in. The number of subshells, or \(l\), describes the shape of the orbital. It can also be used to determine the number of angular nodes. The magnetic quantum number, ml, describes the energy levels in a subshell, and ms refers to the spin on the electron, which can either be up or down. The principal quantum number, \(n\), designates the principal electron shell. Because n describes the most probable distance of the electrons from the nucleus, the larger the number n is, the farther the electron is from the nucleus, the larger the size of the orbital, and the larger the atom is. n can be any positive integer starting at 1, as \(n=1\) designates the first principal shell (the innermost shell). The first principal shell is also called the ground state, or lowest energy state. This explains why \(n\) can not be 0 or any negative integer, because there exists no atoms with zero or a negative amount of energy levels/principal shells. When an electron is in an excited state or it gains energy, it may jump to the second principle shell, where \(n=2\). This is called absorption because the electron is ""absorbing"" photons, or energy. Known as emission, electrons can also ""emit"" energy as they jump to lower principle shells, where n decreases by whole numbers. As the energy of the electron increases, so does the principal quantum number, e.g., n = 3 indicates the third principal shell, n = 4 indicates the fourth principal shell, and so on. Emission, because energy is lost by release of a photon. The orbital angular momentum quantum number \(l\) determines the shape of an orbital, and therefore the angular distribution. The number of angular nodes is equal to the value of the angular momentum quantum number \(l\). (For more information about angular nodes, see Electronic Orbitals.) Each value of \(l\) indicates a specific s, p, d, f subshell (each unique in shape.) The value of \(l\) is dependent on the principal quantum number \(n\). Unlike \(n\), the value of \(l\) can be zero. It can also be a positive integer, but it cannot be larger than one less than the principal quantum number (\(n-1\)): Since \(l\) can be zero or a positive integer less than (\(n-1\)), it can have a value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The number of angular nodes is equal to the value of l, so the number of nodes is also 4. The magnetic quantum number \(m_l\) determines the number of orbitals and their orientation within a subshell. Consequently, its value depends on the orbital angular momentum quantum number \(l\). Given a certain \(l\), \(m_l\) is an interval ranging from \(–l\) to \(+l\), so it can be zero, a negative integer, or a positive integer. Since \(m_l\) must range from \(–l\) to \(+l\), then \(m_l\) can be: -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. Unlike \(n\), \(l\), and \(m_l\), the electron spin quantum number \(m_s\) does not depend on another quantum number. It designates the direction of the electron spin and may have a spin of +1/2, represented by↑, or –1/2, represented by ↓. This means that when \(m_s\) is positive the electron has an upward spin, which can be referred to as ""spin up."" When it is negative, the electron has a downward spin, so it is ""spin down."" The significance of the electron spin quantum number is its determination of an atom's ability to generate a magnetic field or not. (Electron Spin.) List the possible combinations of all four quantum numbers when \(n=2\), \(l=1\), and \(m_l=0\). The fourth quantum number is independent of the first three, allowing the first three quantum numbers of two electrons to be the same. Since the spin can be +1/2 or =1/2, there are two combinations: No, if the value of \(m_s\) is positive, the electron is ""spin up."" The value of the principal quantum number n is the level of the principal electronic shell (principal level). All orbitals that have the same n value are in the same principal level. For example, all orbitals on the second principal level have a principal quantum number of n=2. When the value of n is higher, the number of principal electronic shells is greater. This causes a greater distance between the farthest electron and the nucleus. As a result, the size of the atom and its atomic radius increases. Because the atomic radius increases, the electrons are farther from the nucleus. Thus it is easier for the atom to expel an electron because the nucleus does not have as strong a pull on it, and the ionization energy decreases. The orbital with n=2, because the closer the electron is to the nucleus or the smaller the atomic radius, the more energy it takes to expel an electron. To identify what type of possible subshells n has, these subshells have been assigned letter names. The value of l determines the name of the subshell: We can designate a principal quantum number, n, and a certain subshell by combining the value of n and the name of the subshell (which can be found using l). For example, 3p refers to the third principal quantum number (n=3) and the p subshell (l=1). Knowing that the principal quantum number n is 4 and using the table above, we can conclude that it is 4p. 3s, 3p, and 3d. Because n=3, the possible values of l = 0, 1, 2, which indicates the shapes of each subshell. The number of orbitals in a subshell is equivalent to the number of values the magnetic quantum number ml takes on. A helpful equation to determine the number of orbitals in a subshell is 2l +1. This equation will not give you the value of ml, but the number of possible values that ml can take on in a particular orbital. For example, if l=1 and ml can have values -1, 0, or +1, the value of 2l+1 will be three and there will be three different orbitals. The names of the orbitals are named after the subshells they are found in: In the figure below, we see examples of two orbitals: the p orbital (blue) and the s orbital (red). The red s orbital is a 1s orbital. To picture a 2s orbital, imagine a layer similar to a cross section of a jawbreaker around the circle. The layers are depicting the atoms angular nodes. To picture a 3s orbital, imagine another layer around the circle, and so on and so on. The p orbital is similar to the shape of a dumbbell, with its orientation within a subshell depending on ml. The shape and orientation of an orbital depends on l and ml. To visualize and organize the first three quantum numbers, we can think of them as constituents of a house. In the following image, the roof represents the principal quantum number n, each level represents a subshell l, and each room represents the different orbitals ml in each subshell. The s orbital, because the value of ml can only be 0, can only exist in one plane. The p orbital, however, has three possible values of ml and so it has three possible orientations of the orbitals, shown by Px, Py, and Pz. The pattern continues, with the d orbital containing 5 possible orbital orientations, and f has 7: Another helpful visual in looking at the possible orbitals and subshells with a set of quantum numbers would be the electron orbital diagram. (For more electron orbital diagrams, see Electron Configurations.) The characteristics of each quantum number are depicted in different areas of this diagram.

However, electrons and protons coexist in atoms without attracting each other and collapsing atoms into themselves. In other words, while protons coalesce into a nucleus, electrons travel around it as valence electrons in electron shells without making any effect to the nucleus. Although it seems incongruous to create a mechanism with a particle couple that attracts each other progressively as a proton and electron couple does, it is the most solid structure we can imagine. The reason is as follows. Pauli exclusion principle, in quantum mechanics, states that any identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state even if there is more resort to fermions in that quantum state. To better comprehend this, we have to understand how bosons and fermions differ from each other. In particle physics, one way to classify sub-atomic particles is based on their spin. Bosons have integral spins while fermions have half-integral spins and this difference explains how protons and electrons can coexist in atoms. As I mentioned earlier, the Pauli exclusion principle does not allow any identical and indistinguishable fermions occupy the same quantum state, and so does avoid any attraction between any identical and indistinguishable fermions. It, also, explains how valence shells emerge and valence electrons bind to each other because of being pushed to the outer shells of electrons. On the other hand, the sub-atomic particles that have integer spins behave differently as compared to ones that have half-integer spins. Bose-Einstein statistics describes the sub-atomic particles that have integer spins and according to the Bose-Einstein statistics, bosons can occupy the same quantum state, hence the accumulation of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Since many of the properties of particles are quantized, the state of a particle is often described by a series of numbers called quantum numbers(1).In other words, the charge of a sub-atomic particle, in quantum mechanics, always described as a multiple of a certain value and so is called quantized like the energy of a light beam with respect to the frequency. As another approach to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two fermions can have all their quantum numbers alike so that fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state despite the fact that they have all properties alike except their spin, and only the sub-atomic particles that have integer spins and all quantum numbers alike can occupy the same quantum state. Because of this significant characteristic, fermions follow the Fermi-Dirac statistics instead of the Bose-Einstein statistics. According to the aforementioned description of fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle and the Fermi-Dirac statistics make possible the ordering of electrons around the nucleus of an atom and the ordering of protons and neutrons within the nucleus itself(2).

Not only was this an impressive technological accomplishment, but it paved the way for developments that would indelibly alter modern society.  Semiconductor devices made possible miniaturized electronics, including computers, certain types of medical diagnostic and treatment equipment, and popular telecommunication devices, to name a few applications of this technology. But behind this revolution in technology stands an even greater revolution in general science: the field of quantum physics.  Without this leap in understanding the natural world, the development of semiconductor devices (and more advanced electronic devices still under development) would never have been possible.  Quantum physics is an incredibly complicated realm of science. This chapter is but a brief overview.  When scientists of Feynman's caliber say that “no one understands [it],” you can be sure it is a complex subject.  Without a basic understanding of quantum physics, or at least an understanding of the scientific discoveries that led to its formulation, though, it is impossible to understand how and why semiconductor electronic devices function.  Most introductory electronics textbooks I've read try to explain semiconductors in terms of “classical” physics, resulting in more confusion than comprehension. Many of us have seen diagrams of atoms that look something like Figure   below. Rutherford atom: negative electrons orbit a small  positive nucleus. Tiny particles of matter called protons and neutrons make up the center of the atom; electrons orbit like planets around a star.  The nucleus carries a positive electrical charge, owing to the presence of protons (the neutrons have no electrical charge whatsoever), while the atom's balancing negative charge resides in the orbiting electrons.  The negative electrons are attracted to the positive protons just as planets are gravitationally attracted by the Sun, yet the orbits are stable because of the electrons' motion.  We owe this popular model of the atom to the work of Ernest Rutherford, who around the year 1911 experimentally determined that atoms' positive charges were concentrated in a tiny, dense core rather than being spread evenly about the diameter as was proposed by an earlier researcher, J.J. Thompson. Rutherford's scattering experiment involved bombarding a thin gold foil with positively charged alpha particles as in Figure   below. Young graduate students H. Geiger and E. Marsden experienced unexpected results. A few Alpha particles were deflected at large angles.  A few  Alpha particles were back-scattering, recoiling at nearly 180o. Most of the particles passed through the  gold foil undeflected, indicating that the foil was mostly empty space. The fact that a few alpha particles experienced large deflections indicated the presence of a miniscule positively charged nucleus. Rutherford scattering: a beam of alpha particles is scattered by a thin gold foil. Although Rutherford's atomic model accounted for experimental data better than Thompson's, it still wasn't perfect.  Further attempts at defining atomic structure were undertaken, and these efforts helped pave the way for the bizarre discoveries of quantum physics.  Today our understanding of the atom is quite a bit more complex.  Nevertheless, despite the revolution of quantum physics and its contribution to our understanding of atomic structure, Rutherford's solar-system picture of the atom embedded itself in the popular consciousness to such a degree that it persists in some areas of study even when inappropriate. In keeping with the Rutherford model, this author casts the electrons as solid chunks of matter engaged in circular orbits, their inward attraction to the oppositely charged nucleus balanced by their motion.  The reference to “centrifugal force” is technically incorrect (even for orbiting planets), but is easily forgiven because of its popular acceptance: in reality, there is no such thing as a force pushing any orbiting body away from its center of orbit.  It seems that way because a body's inertia tends to keep it traveling in a straight line, and since an orbit is a constant deviation (acceleration) from straight-line travel, there is constant inertial opposition to whatever force is attracting the body toward the orbit center (centripetal), be it gravity, electrostatic attraction, or even the tension of a mechanical link. The real problem with this explanation, however, is the idea of electrons traveling in circular orbits in the first place.  It is a verifiable fact that accelerating electric charges emit electromagnetic radiation, and this fact was known even in Rutherford's time.  Since orbiting motion is a form of acceleration (the orbiting object in constant acceleration away from normal, straight-line motion), electrons in an orbiting state should be throwing off radiation like mud from a spinning tire.  Electrons accelerated around circular paths in particle accelerators called synchrotrons are known to do this, and the result is called synchrotron radiation.  If electrons were losing energy in this way, their orbits would eventually decay, resulting in collisions with the positively charged nucleus.  Nevertheless, this doesn't ordinarily happen within atoms.  Indeed, electron “orbits” are remarkably stable over a wide range of conditions. Furthermore, experiments with “excited” atoms demonstrated that electromagnetic energy emitted by an atom only occurs  at certain, definite frequencies.  Atoms that are “excited” by outside influences such as light are known to absorb that energy and return it as electromagnetic waves of specific frequencies, like a tuning fork that rings at a fixed pitch no matter how it is struck.  When the light emitted by an excited atom is divided into its constituent frequencies (colors) by a prism, distinct lines of color appear in the spectrum, the pattern of spectral lines being unique to that element.  This phenomenon is commonly used to identify atomic elements, and even measure the proportions of each element in a compound or chemical mixture.  According to Rutherford's solar-system atomic model (regarding electrons as chunks of matter free to orbit at any radius) and the laws of classical physics, excited atoms should return energy over a virtually limitless range of frequencies rather than a select few.  In other words, if Rutherford's model were correct, there would be no “tuning fork” effect, and the light spectrum emitted by any atom would appear as a continuous band of colors rather than as a few distinct lines. Bohr hydrogen atom (with orbits drawn to scale) only allows electrons to inhabit discrete orbitals. Electrons falling from n=3,4,5, or 6 to n=2 accounts for Balmer series of spectral lines. A pioneering researcher by the name of Niels Bohr attempted to improve upon Rutherford's model after studying in Rutherford's laboratory for several months in 1912.  Trying to harmonize the findings of other physicists (most notably, Max Planck and Albert Einstein), Bohr suggested that each electron had a certain, specific amount of energy, and that their orbits were quantized such that each may  occupy certain places around the nucleus, as marbles fixed in circular tracks around the nucleus rather than the free-ranging satellites each were formerly imagined to be. (Figure   above)  In deference to the laws of electromagnetics and accelerating charges, Bohr alluded to these “orbits” as stationary states to escape the implication that they were in motion. Although Bohr's ambitious attempt at re-framing the structure of the atom in terms that agreed closer to experimental results was a milestone in physics, it was not complete.  His mathematical analysis produced better predictions of experimental events than analyses belonging to previous models, but there were still some unanswered questions about why electrons should behave in such strange ways.  The assertion that electrons existed in stationary, quantized states around the nucleus  accounted for experimental data better than Rutherford's model, but he had no idea what would force electrons to manifest those particular states.  The answer to that question had to come from another physicist, Louis de Broglie, about a decade later. De Broglie proposed that electrons, as photons (particles of light) manifested both particle-like and wave-like properties.  Building on this proposal, he suggested that an analysis of orbiting electrons from a wave perspective rather than a particle perspective might make more sense of their quantized nature.  Indeed, another breakthrough in understanding was reached. String vibrating at resonant frequency between two fixed points forms standing wave. The atom according to de Broglie consisted of electrons existing as standing waves, a phenomenon well known to physicists in a variety of forms.  As the plucked string of a musical instrument  (Figure   above) vibrating at a resonant frequency, with “nodes” and “antinodes” at stable positions along its length. De Broglie envisioned electrons around atoms standing as waves bent around a circle as in Figure   below. “Orbiting” electron as standing wave around the nucleus, (a) two cycles per orbit, (b) three cycles per orbit. Electrons only could  exist in certain, definite “orbits” around the nucleus because those were the only distances where the wave ends would match.  In any other radius, the wave should destructively interfere with itself and thus cease to exist. De Broglie's hypothesis gave both mathematical support and a convenient physical analogy to account for the quantized states of electrons within an atom, but his atomic model was still incomplete.  Within a few years, though, physicists Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger, working independently of each other, built upon de Broglie's concept of a matter-wave duality to create more mathematically rigorous models of subatomic particles. This theoretical advance from de Broglie's primitive standing wave model to Heisenberg's matrix and Schrodinger's differential equation models was given the name quantum mechanics, and it introduced a rather shocking characteristic to the world of subatomic particles: the trait of probability, or uncertainty.  According to the new quantum theory, it was impossible to determine the exact position and exact momentum of a particle at the same time.  The popular explanations of this “uncertainty principle”  was that it was a measurement  error usually caused by the process of measurement (i.e. by attempting to precisely measure the position of an electron, you interfere with its momentum and thus cannot know what it was before the position measurement was taken, and vice versa).  The startling implication of quantum mechanics is that particles do not actually have precise positions and momenta, but rather balance the two quantities in a such way that their combined uncertainties never diminish below a certain minimum value. This form of “uncertainty” relationship exists in areas other than quantum mechanics.  As discussed in the “Mixed-Frequency AC Signals” chapter in volume II of this book series, there is a mutually exclusive relationship between the certainty of a waveform's time-domain data and its frequency-domain data.  In simple terms, the more precisely we know its constituent frequency(ies), the less precisely we know its amplitude in time, and vice versa.  To quote myself: In order to precisely determine the amplitude of a varying signal, we must sample it over a very narrow span of time.  However, doing this limits our view of the wave's frequency.  Conversely, to determine a wave's frequency with great precision, we must sample it over many cycles, which means we lose view of its amplitude at any given moment.  Thus, we cannot simultaneously know the instantaneous amplitude and the overall frequency of any wave with unlimited precision.  Stranger yet, this uncertainty is much more than observer imprecision; it resides in the very nature of the wave.  It is not as though it would be possible, given the proper technology, to obtain precise measurements of both instantaneous amplitude and frequency at once.  Quite literally, a wave cannot have both a precise, instantaneous amplitude, and a precise frequency at the same time. The minimum uncertainty of a particle's position and momentum expressed by Heisenberg and Schrodinger has nothing to do with limitation in measurement; rather it is an intrinsic property of the particle's matter-wave dual nature.  Electrons, therefore, do not really exist in their “orbits” as precisely defined bits of matter, or even as precisely defined waveshapes, but rather as “clouds” -- the technical term is wavefunction -- of probability distribution, as if each electron were “spread” or “smeared” over a range of positions and momenta. This radical view of electrons as imprecise clouds at first seems to contradict the original principle of quantized electron states: that electrons exist in discrete, defined “orbits” around atomic nuclei.  It was, after all, this discovery that led to the formation of quantum theory to explain it.  How odd it seems that a theory developed to explain the discrete behavior of electrons ends up declaring that electrons exist as “clouds” rather than as discrete pieces of matter.  However, the quantized behavior of electrons does not depend on electrons having definite position and momentum values, but rather on other properties called quantum numbers.  In essence, quantum mechanics dispenses with commonly held notions of absolute position and absolute momentum, and replaces them with absolute notions of a sort having no analogue in common experience. Even though electrons are known to exist in ethereal, “cloud-like” forms of distributed probability rather than as discrete chunks of matter, those “clouds” have other characteristics that are discrete.  Any electron in an atom can be described by four numerical measures (the previously mentioned quantum numbers), called the Principal, Angular Momentum, Magnetic, and Spin numbers.  The following is a synopsis of each of these numbers' meanings: Principal Quantum Number: Symbolized by the letter n, this number describes the shell that an electron resides in.  An electron “shell” is a region of space around an atom's nucleus that electrons are allowed to exist in, corresponding to the stable “standing wave” patterns of de Broglie and Bohr.  Electrons may “leap” from shell to shell, but cannot exist between the shell regions. The principle quantum number must be a  positive integer (a whole number, greater than or equal to 1).  In other words, principle quantum number for an electron cannot be 1/2 or -3.  These integer values were not arrived at arbitrarily, but rather through experimental evidence of light spectra: the differing frequencies (colors) of light emitted by excited hydrogen atoms follow a sequence mathematically dependent on specific, integer values as illustrated in Figure   previous. Each shell has the capacity to hold multiple electrons.  An analogy for electron shells is the concentric rows of seats of an amphitheater.  Just as a person seated in an amphitheater must choose a row to sit in (one cannot sit between rows), electrons must “choose” a particular shell to “sit” in.  As in amphitheater rows, the outermost shells are  hold more electrons than the inner shells.  Also, electrons tend to seek the lowest available shell, as people in an amphitheater seek the closest seat to the center stage.  The higher the shell number, the greater the energy of the electrons in it. The maximum number of electrons that any shell may hold is described by the equation 2n2, where “n” is the principle quantum number.  Thus, the first shell (n=1) can hold 2 electrons; the second shell (n=2) 8 electrons, and the third shell (n=3) 18 electrons. (Figure   below) Principal quantum number n and maximum number of electrons per shell both predicted by 2(n2), and observed. Orbitals not to scale. Electron shells in an atom were formerly designated by letter rather than by number.  The first shell (n=1) was labeled K, the second shell (n=2) L, the third shell (n=3) M, the fourth shell (n=4) N, the fifth shell (n=5) O, the sixth shell (n=6) P, and the seventh shell (n=7) Q. Orbitals: (s) Three fold symmetry. (p) Shown: sx, one of three possible orientations (sx, sy, sz ), about their respective axes. (d) Shown: dx2-y x2 similar to dxz, dyz, dxz. Shown: dz2. Possible d-orbital orientations: five. Valid angular momentum quantum numbers are positive integers like principal quantum numbers, but also include zero.  These quantum numbers for electrons are symbolized by the letter l.  The number of subshells in a shell is equal to the shell's principal quantum number.  Thus, the first shell (n=1) has one subshell, numbered 0; the second shell (n=2) has two subshells, numbered 0 and 1; the third shell (n=3) has three subshells, numbered 0, 1, and 2. An older convention for subshell description used letters rather than numbers.  In this notation, the first subshell (l=0) was designated s, the second subshell (l=1) designated p, the third subshell (l=2) designated d, and the fourth subshell (l=3) designated f.  The letters come from the words sharp, principal (not to be confused with the principal quantum number, n), diffuse, and fundamental.  You will still see this notational convention in many periodic tables, used to designate the electron configuration of the atoms' outermost, or valence, shells.  (Figure   below) (a) Bohr representation of Silver atom, (b) Subshell representation of Ag with division of shells into subshells (angular quantum number l). This diagram implies nothing about the actual position of electrons, but represents energy levels. Magnetic Quantum Number: The magnetic quantum number for an electron classifies which orientation its subshell shape is pointed.  The “lobes” for  subshells point in  multiple directions. These different orientations are called orbitals.  For the first subshell (s; l=0), which resembles a sphere pointing in  no “direction”, so there is only one orbital.  For the second (p; l=1) subshell in each shell, which resembles  dumbbells point in  three  possible directions. Think of three dumbbells intersecting at the origin, each oriented along a different axis in a three-axis coordinate space. Valid numerical values for this quantum number consist of integers ranging from -l to l, and are symbolized as ml in atomic physics and lz in nuclear physics.  To calculate the number of orbitals in any given subshell, double the subshell number and add 1 (2l + 1).  For example, the first subshell (l=0) in any shell contains a single orbital, numbered 0; the second subshell (l=1) in any shell contains three orbitals, numbered -1, 0, and 1; the third subshell (l=2) contains five orbitals, numbered -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2; and so on. Like principal quantum numbers, the magnetic quantum number arose directly from experimental evidence: The Zeeman effect, the division of spectral lines by exposing an ionized gas to a magnetic field, hence the name “magnetic” quantum number. Spin Quantum Number: Like the magnetic quantum number, this property of atomic electrons was discovered through experimentation.  Close observation of spectral lines revealed that each line was actually a pair of very closely-spaced lines, and this so-called fine structure was hypothesized to result from each electron “spinning” on an axis as if a planet.  Electrons with different “spins” would give off slightly different frequencies of light when excited. The name “spin” was  assigned to this quantum number.  The concept of a spinning electron is now obsolete, being better suited to the (incorrect) view of electrons as discrete chunks of matter rather than as  “clouds”; but, the name remains. Spin quantum numbers are symbolized as ms in atomic physics and sz in nuclear physics.  For each orbital in each subshell in each shell, there may be two electrons, one with a spin of +1/2 and the other with a spin of -1/2. The physicist Wolfgang Pauli developed a principle explaining the ordering of electrons in an atom according to these quantum numbers.  His principle, called the Pauli exclusion principle, states that no two electrons in the same atom may occupy the exact same quantum states.  That is, each electron in an atom has a unique set of quantum numbers.  This limits the number of electrons that may occupy any given orbital, subshell, and shell. With one proton in the nucleus, it takes one electron to electrostatically balance the atom (the proton's positive electric charge exactly balanced by the electron's negative electric charge).  This one electron resides in the lowest shell (n=1), the first subshell (l=0), in the only orbital (spatial orientation) of that subshell (ml=0), with a spin value of 1/2.  A common method of describing this organization is by listing the electrons according to their shells and subshells in a convention called spectroscopic notation.  In this notation, the shell number is shown as an integer, the subshell as a letter (s,p,d,f), and the total number of electrons in the subshell (all orbitals, all spins) as a superscript.  Thus, hydrogen, with its lone electron residing in the base level, is described as 1s1. A helium atom has two protons in the nucleus, and this necessitates two electrons to balance the double-positive electric charge.  Since two electrons -- one with spin=1/2 and the other with spin=-1/2 --  fit into one orbital, the electron configuration of helium requires no additional subshells or shells to hold the second electron. However, an atom requiring three or more electrons will require additional subshells to hold all electrons, since only two electrons will fit into the lowest shell (n=1).  Consider the next atom in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers, lithium: An atom of lithium  uses a fraction of the L shell's (n=2) capacity.  This shell actually has a total capacity of eight electrons (maximum shell capacity = 2n2 electrons).  If we examine the organization of the atom with a completely filled L shell, we will see how all combinations of subshells, orbitals, and spins are occupied by electrons: Often, when the spectroscopic notation is given for an atom, any shells that are completely filled are omitted, and the unfilled, or the highest-level filled shell, is denoted.  For example, the element neon (shown in the previous illustration), which has two completely filled shells, may be spectroscopically described simply as 2p6 rather than 1s22s22p6.  Lithium, with its K shell completely filled and a solitary electron in the L shell, may be described simply as 2s1 rather than 1s22s1. The omission of completely filled, lower-level shells is not just a notational convenience.  It also illustrates a basic principle of chemistry: that the chemical behavior of an element is primarily determined by its unfilled shells.  Both hydrogen and lithium have a single electron in their outermost shells (1s1 and 2s1, respectively), and this gives the two elements some similar properties.  Both are highly reactive, and reactive in much the same way (bonding to similar elements in similar modes).  It matters little that lithium has a completely filled K shell underneath its almost-vacant L shell: the unfilled L shell is the shell that determines its chemical behavior. Elements having completely filled outer shells are classified as noble, and are distinguished by  almost complete non-reactivity with other elements.  These elements used to be classified as inert, when it was thought that these were completely unreactive, but are now known to  form compounds with other elements under specific conditions. Periodic table of chemical elements. Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, was the first to develop a periodic table of the elements.  Although Mendeleev organized his table according to atomic mass rather than atomic number, and produced a table that was not quite as useful as modern periodic tables, his development stands as an excellent example of scientific proof.  Seeing the patterns of periodicity (similar chemical properties according to atomic mass), Mendeleev hypothesized that all elements should fit into this ordered scheme.  When he discovered “empty” spots in the table, he followed the logic of the existing order and hypothesized the existence of heretofore undiscovered elements.  The subsequent discovery of those elements granted scientific legitimacy to Mendeleev's hypothesis, furthering future discoveries, and leading to the form of the periodic table we use today. This is how science should work: hypotheses followed to their logical conclusions, and accepted, modified, or rejected as determined by the agreement of experimental data to those conclusions.  Any fool may formulate a hypothesis after-the-fact to explain existing experimental data, and many do.  What sets a scientific hypothesis apart from post hoc speculation is the prediction of future experimental data yet uncollected, and the possibility of disproof as a result of that data.  To boldly follow a hypothesis to its logical conclusion(s) and dare to predict the results of future experiments is not a dogmatic leap of faith, but rather a public test of that hypothesis, open to challenge from anyone able to produce contradictory data.  In other words, scientific hypotheses are always“risky” due to the claim to predict the results of experiments not yet conducted, and are therefore susceptible to disproof if the experiments do not turn out as predicted.  Thus, if a hypothesis successfully predicts the results of repeated experiments, its falsehood is disproven. Quantum mechanics, first as a hypothesis and later as a theory, has proven to be extremely successful in predicting experimental results, hence the high degree of scientific confidence placed in it.  Many scientists have reason to believe that it is an incomplete theory, though, as its predictions hold true more at micro  physical scales than at macroscopic dimensions, but nevertheless it is a tremendously useful theory in explaining and predicting the interactions of particles and atoms. As you have already seen in this chapter, quantum physics is essential in describing and predicting many different phenomena.  In the next section, we will see its significance in the electrical conductivity of solid substances, including semiconductors.  Simply put, nothing in chemistry or solid-state physics makes sense within the popular theoretical framework of electrons existing as discrete chunks of matter, whirling around atomic nuclei like miniature satellites.  It is when electrons are viewed as “wavefunctions” existing in definite, discrete states that the regular and periodic behavior of matter can be explained.","This chapter will cover the physics behind the operation of semiconductor devices and show how these principles are applied in several different types of semiconductor devices.  Subsequent chapters will deal primarily with the practical aspects of these devices in circuits and omit theory as much as possible. To say that the invention of semiconductor devices was a revolution would not be an exaggeration.  Not only was this an impressive technological accomplishment, but it paved the way for developments that would indelibly alter modern society.  Semiconductor devices made possible miniaturized electronics, including computers, certain types of medical diagnostic and treatment equipment, and popular telecommunication devices, to name a few applications of this technology. But behind this revolution in technology stands an even greater revolution in general science: the field of quantum physics.  Without this leap in understanding the natural world, the development of semiconductor devices (and more advanced electronic devices still under development) would never have been possible.  Quantum physics is an incredibly complicated realm of science, and this chapter is by no means a complete discussion of it, but rather a brief overview.  When scientists of Feynman's caliber say that ""no one understands [it],"" you can be sure it is a complex subject.  Without a basic understanding of quantum physics, or at least an understanding of the scientific discoveries that led to its formulation, though, it is impossible to understand how and why semiconductor electronic devices function.  Most introductory electronics textbooks I've read attempt to explain semiconductors in terms of ""classical"" physics, resulting in more confusion than comprehension. Tiny particles of matter called protons and neutrons make up the center of the atom, while electrons orbit around not unlike planets around a star.  The nucleus carries a positive electrical charge, owing to the presence of protons (the neutrons have no electrical charge whatsoever), while the atom's balancing negative charge resides in the orbiting electrons.  The negative electrons tend to be attracted to the positive protons just as planets are gravitationally attracted toward whatever object(s) they orbit, yet the orbits are stable due to the electrons' motion.  We owe this popular model of the atom to the work of Ernest Rutherford, who around the year 1911 experimentally determined that atoms' positive charges were concentrated in a tiny, dense core rather than being spread evenly about the diameter as was proposed by an earlier researcher, J.J. Thompson. While Rutherford's atomic model accounted for experimental data better than Thompson's, it still wasn't perfect.  Further attempts at defining atomic structure were undertaken, and these efforts helped pave the way for the bizarre discoveries of quantum physics.  Today our understanding of the atom is quite a bit more complex.  However, despite the revolution of quantum physics and the impact it had on our understanding of atomic structure, Rutherford's solar-system picture of the atom embedded itself in the popular conscience to such a degree that it persists in some areas of study even when inappropriate. In keeping with the Rutherford model, this author casts the electrons as solid chunks of matter engaged in circular orbits, their inward attraction to the oppositely charged nucleus balanced by their motion.  The reference to ""centrifugal force"" is technically incorrect (even for orbiting planets), but is easily forgiven due to its popular acceptance: in reality, there is no such thing as a force pushing any orbiting body away from its center of orbit.  It only seems that way because a body's inertia tends to keep it traveling in a straight line, and since an orbit is a constant deviation (acceleration) from straight-line travel, there is constant inertial opposition to whatever force is attracting the body toward the orbit center (centripetal), be it gravity, electrostatic attraction, or even the tension of a mechanical link. The real problem with this explanation, however, is the idea of electrons traveling in circular orbits in the first place.  It is a verifiable fact that accelerating electric charges emit electromagnetic radiation, and this fact was known even in Rutherford's time.  Since orbiting motion is a form of acceleration (the orbiting object in constant acceleration away from normal, straight-line motion), electrons in an orbiting state should be throwing off radiation like mud from a spinning tire.  Electrons accelerated around circular paths in particle accelerators called synchrotrons are known to do this, and the result is called synchrotron radiation.  If electrons were losing energy in this way, their orbits would eventually decay, resulting in collisions with the positively charged nucleus.  However, this doesn't ordinarily happen within atoms.  Indeed, electron ""orbits"" are remarkably stable over a wide range of conditions. Furthermore, experiments with ""excited"" atoms demonstrated that electromagnetic energy emitted by an atom occurs only at certain, definite frequencies.  Atoms that are ""excited"" by outside influences such as light are known to absorb that energy and return it as electromagnetic waves of very specific frequencies, like a tuning fork that rings at a fixed pitch no matter how it is struck.  When the light emitted by an excited atom is divided into its constituent frequencies (colors) by a prism, distinct lines of color appear in the spectrum, the pattern of spectral lines being unique to that element.  So regular is this phenomenon that it is commonly used to identify atomic elements, and even measure the proportions of each element in a compound or chemical mixture.  According to Rutherford's solar-system atomic model (regarding electrons as chunks of matter free to orbit at any radius) and the laws of classical physics, excited atoms should be able to return energy over a virtually limitless range of frequencies rather than a select few.  In other words, if Rutherford's model were correct, there would be no ""tuning fork"" effect, and the light spectrum emitted by any atom would appear as a continuous band of colors rather than as a few distinct lines. A pioneering researcher by the name of Niels Bohr attempted to improve upon Rutherford's model after studying in Rutherford's laboratory for several months in 1912.  Trying to harmonize the findings of other physicists (most notably, Max Planck and Albert Einstein), Bohr suggested that each electron possessed a certain, specific amount of energy, and that their orbits were likewise quantized such that they could only occupy certain places around the nucleus, somewhat like marbles fixed in circular tracks around the nucleus rather than the free-ranging satellites they were formerly imagined to be.  In deference to the laws of electromagnetics and accelerating charges, Bohr referred to these ""orbits"" as stationary states so as to escape the implication that they were in motion. While Bohr's ambitious attempt at re-framing the structure of the atom in terms that agreed closer to experimental results was a milestone in physics, it was by no means complete.  His mathematical analyses produced better predictions of experimental events than analyses belonging to previous models, but there were still some unanswered questions as to why electrons would behave in such strange ways.  The assertion that electrons existed in stationary, quantized states around the nucleus certainly accounted for experimental data better than Rutherford's model, but he had no idea what would force electrons to manifest those particular states.  The answer to that question had to come from another physicist, Louis de Broglie, about a decade later. De Broglie proposed that electrons, like photons (particles of light) manifested both particle-like and wave-like properties.  Building on this proposal, he suggested that an analysis of orbiting electrons from a wave perspective rather than a particle perspective might make more sense of their quantized nature.  Indeed, this was the case, and another breakthrough in understanding was reached. The atom according to de Broglie consisted of electrons existing in the form of standing waves, a phenomenon well known to physicists in a variety of forms.  Like the plucked string of a musical instrument vibrating at a resonant frequency, with ""nodes"" and ""antinodes"" at stable positions along its length, de Broglie envisioned electrons around atoms standing as waves bent around a circle: Electrons could only exist in certain, definite ""orbits"" around the nucleus because those were the only distances where the wave ends would match.  In any other radius, the wave would destructively interfere with itself and thus cease to exist. De Broglie's hypothesis gave both mathematical support and a convenient physical analogy to account for the quantized states of electrons within an atom, but his atomic model was still incomplete.  Within a few years, though, physicists Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger, working independently of each other, built upon de Broglie's concept of a matter-wave duality to create more mathematically rigorous models of subatomic particles. This theoretical advance from de Broglie's primitive standing wave model to Heisenberg's matrix and Schrodinger's differential equation models was given the name quantum mechanics, and it introduced a rather shocking characteristic to the world of subatomic particles: the trait of probability, or uncertainty.  According to the new quantum theory, it was impossible to determine the exact position and exact momentum of a particle at the same time.  Popular explanations of this ""uncertainty principle"" usually cast it in terms of error caused by the process of measurement (i.e. by attempting to precisely measure the position of an electron, you interfere with its momentum and thus cannot know what it was before the position measurement was taken, and visa versa), but the truth is actually much more mysterious than simple measurement interference.  The startling implication of quantum mechanics is that particles do not actually possess precise positions and momenta, but rather balance the two quantities in a such way that their combined uncertainties never diminish below a certain minimum value. It is interesting to note that this form of ""uncertainty"" relationship exists in areas other than quantum mechanics.  As discussed in the ""Mixed-Frequency AC Signals"" chapter in volume II of this book series, there is a mutually exclusive relationship between the certainty of a waveform's time-domain data and its frequency-domain data.  In simple terms, the more precisely we know its constituent frequency(ies), the less precisely we know its amplitude in time, and vice versa.  To quote myself: In order to precisely determine the amplitude of a varying signal, we must sample it over a very narrow span of time.  However, doing this limits our view of the wave's frequency.  Conversely, to determine a wave's frequency with great precision, we must sample it over many, many cycles, which means we lose view of its amplitude at any given moment.  Thus, we cannot simultaneously know the instantaneous amplitude and the overall frequency of any wave with unlimited precision.  Stranger yet, this uncertainty is much more than observer imprecision; it resides in the very nature of the wave itself.  It is not as though it would be possible, given the proper technology, to obtain precise measurements of both instantaneous amplitude and frequency at once.  Quite literally, a wave cannot possess both a precise, instantaneous amplitude, and a precise frequency at the same time. Likewise, the minimum uncertainty of a particle's position and momentum expressed by Heisenberg and Schrodinger has nothing to do with limitation in measurement; rather it is an intrinsic property of the particle's matter-wave dual nature.  Electrons, therefore, do not really exist in their ""orbits"" as precisely defined bits of matter, or even as precisely defined waveshapes, but rather as ""clouds"" -- the technical term is wavefunction -- of probability distribution, as if each electron were ""spread"" or ""smeared"" over a range of positions and momenta. This radical view of electrons as imprecise clouds at first seems to contradict the original principle of quantized electron states: that electrons exist in discrete, defined ""orbits"" around atomic nuclei.  It was, after all, this discovery that led to the formation of quantum theory to explain it.  How odd it seems that a theory developed to explain the discrete behavior of electrons ends up declaring that electrons exist as ""clouds"" rather than as discrete pieces of matter.  However, the quantized behavior of electrons does not depend on electrons having definite position and momentum values, but rather on other properties called quantum numbers.  In essence, quantum mechanics dispenses with commonly held notions of absolute position and absolute momentum, and replaces them with absolute notions of a sort having no analogue in common experience. Even though electrons are known to exist in ethereal, ""cloud-like"" forms of distributed probability rather than as discrete chunks of matter, those ""clouds"" possess other characteristics that are discrete.  Any electron in an atom can be described in terms of four numerical measures (the previously mentioned quantum numbers), called the Principal, Angular Momentum, Magnetic, and Spin numbers.  The following is a synopsis of each of these numbers' meanings: Principal Quantum Number: Symbolized by the letter n, this number describes the shell that an electron resides in.  An electron ""shell"" is a region of space around an atom's nucleus that electrons are allowed to exist in, corresponding to the stable ""standing wave"" patterns of de Broglie and Bohr.  Electrons may ""leap"" from shell to shell, but cannot exist between the shell regions. The principle quantum number can be any positive integer (a whole number, greater than or equal to 1).  In other words, there is no such thing as a principle quantum number for an electron of 1/2 or -3.  These integer values were not arrived at arbitrarily, but rather through experimental evidence of light spectra: the differing frequencies (colors) of light emitted by excited hydrogen atoms follow a sequence mathematically dependent on specific, integer values. Each shell has the capacity to hold multiple electrons.  An analogy for electron shells is the concentric rows of seats of an amphitheater.  Just as a person seated in an amphitheater must choose a row to sit in (for there is no place to sit in the space between rows), electrons must ""choose"" a particular shell to ""sit"" in.  Like amphitheater rows, the outermost shells are able to hold more electrons than the inner shells.  Also, electrons tend to seek the lowest available shell, like people in an amphitheater trying to find the closest seat to the center stage.  The higher the shell number, the greater the energy of the electrons in it. The maximum number of electrons that any shell can hold is described by the equation 2n2, where ""n"" is the principle quantum number.  Thus, the first shell (n=1) can hold 2 electrons; the second shell (n=2) 8 electrons, and the third shell (n=3) 18 electrons. Electron shells in an atom are sometimes designated by letter rather than by number.  The first shell (n=1) is labeled K, the second shell (n=2) L, the third shell (n=3) M, the fourth shell (n=4) N, the fifth shell (n=5) O, the sixth shell (n=6) P, and the seventh shell (n=7) Q. Angular Momentum Quantum Number: Within each shell, there are subshells.  One might be inclined to think of subshells as simple subdivisions of shells, like lanes dividing a road, but the truth is much stranger than this.  Subshells are regions of space where electron ""clouds"" are allowed to exist, and different subshells actually have different shapes.  The first subshell is shaped like a sphere, which makes sense to most people, visualizing a cloud of electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus in three dimensions.  The second subshell, however, resembles a dumbbell, comprised of two ""lobes"" joined together at a single point near the atom's center.  The third subshell typically resembles a set of four ""lobes"" clustered around the atom's nucleus.  These subshell shapes are reminiscent of graphical depictions of radio antenna signal strength, with bulbous lobe-shaped regions extending from the antenna in various directions. Valid angular momentum quantum numbers are positive integers like principal quantum numbers, but also include zero.  These quantum numbers for electrons are symbolized by the letter l.  The number of subshells in a shell is equal to the shell's principal quantum number.  Thus, the first shell (n=1) has one subshell, numbered 0; the second shell (n=2) has two subshells, numbered 0 and 1; the third shell (n=3) has three subshells, numbered 0, 1, and 2. An older convention for subshell description used letters rather than numbers.  In this notational system, the first subshell (l=0) was designated s, the second subshell (l=1) designated p, the third subshell (l=2) designated d, and the fourth subshell (l=3) designated f.  The letters come from the words sharp, principal (not to be confused with the principal quantum number, n), diffuse, and fundamental.  You will still see this notational convention in many periodic tables, used to designate the electron configuration of the atoms' outermost, or valence, shells. Magnetic Quantum Number: The magnetic quantum number for an electron classifies which orientation its subshell shape is pointed.  For each subshell in each shell, there are multiple directions in which the ""lobes"" can point, and these different orientations are called orbitals.  For the first subshell (s; l=0), which resembles a sphere, there is no ""direction"" it can ""point,"" so there is only one orbital.  For the second (p; l=1) subshell in each shell, which resembles a dumbbell, there are three different directions they can be oriented (think of three dumbbells intersecting in the middle, each oriented along a different axis in a three-axis coordinate system). Valid numerical values for this quantum number consist of integers ranging from -l to l, and are symbolized as ml in atomic physics and lz in nuclear physics.  To calculate the number of orbitals in any given subshell, double the subshell number and add 1 (2l + 1).  For example, the first subshell (l=0) in any shell contains a single orbital, numbered 0; the second subshell (l=1) in any shell contains three orbitals, numbered -1, 0, and 1; the third subshell (l=2) contains five orbitals, numbered -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2; and so on. Like principal quantum numbers, the magnetic quantum number arose directly from experimental evidence: the division of spectral lines as a result of exposing an ionized gas to a magnetic field, hence the name ""magnetic"" quantum number. Spin Quantum Number: Like the magnetic quantum number, this property of atomic electrons was discovered through experimentation.  Close observation of spectral lines revealed that each line was actually a pair of very closely-spaced lines, and this so-called fine structure was hypothesized to be the result of each electron ""spinning"" on an axis like a planet.  Electrons with different ""spins"" would give off slightly different frequencies of light when excited, and so the quantum number of ""spin"" came to be named as such.  The concept of a spinning electron is now obsolete, being better suited to the (incorrect) view of electrons as discrete chunks of matter rather than as the ""clouds"" they really are, but the name remains. Spin quantum numbers are symbolized as ms in atomic physics and sz in nuclear physics.  For each orbital in each subshell in each shell, there can be two electrons, one with a spin of +1/2 and the other with a spin of -1/2. The physicist Wolfgang Pauli developed a principle explaining the ordering of electrons in an atom according to these quantum numbers.  His principle, called the Pauli exclusion principle, states that no two electrons in the same atom may occupy the exact same quantum states.  That is, each electron in an atom has a unique set of quantum numbers.  This limits the number of electrons that may occupy any given orbital, subshell, and shell. With one proton in the nucleus, it takes one electron to electrostatically balance the atom (the proton's positive electric charge exactly balanced by the electron's negative electric charge).  This one electron resides in the lowest shell (n=1), the first subshell (l=0), in the only orbital (spatial orientation) of that subshell (ml=0), with a spin value of 1/2.  A very common method of describing this organization is by listing the electrons according to their shells and subshells in a convention called spectroscopic notation.  In this notation, the shell number is shown as an integer, the subshell as a letter (s,p,d,f), and the total number of electrons in the subshell (all orbitals, all spins) as a superscript.  Thus, hydrogen, with its lone electron residing in the base level, would be described as 1s1. A helium atom has two protons in the nucleus, and this necessitates two electrons to balance the double-positive electric charge.  Since two electrons -- one with spin=1/2 and the other with spin=-1/2 -- will fit into one orbital, the electron configuration of helium requires no additional subshells or shells to hold the second electron. However, an atom requiring three or more electrons will require additional subshells to hold all electrons, since only two electrons will fit into the lowest shell (n=1).  Consider the next atom in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers, lithium: An atom of lithium only uses a fraction of the L shell's (n=2) capacity.  This shell actually has a total capacity of eight electrons (maximum shell capacity = 2n2 electrons).  If we examine the organization of the atom with a completely filled L shell, we will see how all combinations of subshells, orbitals, and spins are occupied by electrons: Often, when the spectroscopic notation is given for an atom, any shells that are completely filled are omitted, and only the unfilled, or the highest-level filled shell, is denoted.  For example, the element neon (shown in the previous illustration), which has two completely filled shells, may be spectroscopically described simply as 2p6 rather than 1s22s22p6.  Lithium, with its K shell completely filled and a solitary electron in the L shell, may be described simply as 2s1 rather than 1s22s1. The omission of completely filled, lower-level shells is not just a notational convenience.  It also illustrates a basic principle of chemistry: that the chemical behavior of an element is primarily determined by its unfilled shells.  Both hydrogen and lithium have a single electron in their outermost shells (1s1 and 2s1, respectively), and this gives the two elements some similar properties.  Both are highly reactive, and reactive in much the same way (bonding to similar elements in similar modes).  It matters little that lithium has a completely filled K shell underneath its almost-vacant L shell: the unfilled L shell is the shell that determines its chemical behavior. Elements having completely filled outer shells are classified as noble, and are distinguished by their almost complete non-reactivity with other elements.  These elements used to be classified as inert, when it was thought that they were completely unreactive, but it is now known that they may form compounds with other elements under certain conditions. Given the fact that elements with identical electron configurations in their outermost shell(s) exhibit similar chemical properties, it makes sense to organize the different elements in a table accordingly.  Such a table is known as a periodic table of the elements, and modern tables follow this general form: Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, was the first to develop a periodic table of the elements.  Although Mendeleev organized his table according to atomic mass rather than atomic number, and so produced a table that was not quite as useful as modern periodic tables, his development stands as an excellent example of scientific proof.  Seeing the patterns of periodicity (similar chemical properties according to atomic mass), Mendeleev hypothesized that all elements would fit into this ordered scheme.  When he discovered ""empty"" spots in the table, he followed the logic of the existing order and hypothesized the existence of heretofore undiscovered elements.  The subsequent discovery of those elements granted scientific legitimacy to Mendeleev's hypothesis, further discoveries leading to the form of the periodic table we use today. This is how science should work: hypotheses followed to their logical conclusions, and accepted, modified, or rejected as determined by the agreement of experimental data to those conclusions.  Any fool can formulate a hypothesis after-the-fact to explain existing experimental data, and many do.  What sets a scientific hypothesis apart from post hoc speculation is the prediction of future experimental data yet uncollected, and the possibility of disproof as a result of that data.  To boldly follow a hypothesis to its logical conclusion(s) and dare to predict the results of future experiments is not a dogmatic leap of faith, but rather a public test of that hypothesis, open to challenge from anyone able to produce contradictory data.  In other words, scientific hypotheses are always ""risky"" in the sense that they claim to predict the results of experiments not yet conducted, and are therefore susceptible to disproof if the experiments do not turn out as predicted.  Thus, if a hypothesis successfully predicts the results of repeated experiments, there is little probability of its falsehood. Quantum mechanics, first as a hypothesis and later as a theory, has proven to be extremely successful in predicting experimental results, hence the high degree of scientific confidence placed in it.  Many scientists have reason to believe that it is an incomplete theory, though, as its predictions hold true more so at very small physical scales than at macroscopic dimensions, but nevertheless it is a tremendously useful theory in explaining and predicting the interactions of particles and atoms. As you have already seen in this chapter, quantum physics is essential in describing and predicting many different phenomena.  In the next section, we will see its significance in the electrical conductivity of solid substances, including semiconductors.  Simply put, nothing in chemistry or solid-state physics makes sense within the popular theoretical framework of electrons existing as discrete chunks of matter, whirling around atomic nuclei like miniature satellites.  It is only when electrons are viewed as ""wavefunctions"" existing in definite, discrete states that the regular and periodic behavior of matter can be explained. Quantum physics describes the states of electrons in an atom according to the four-fold scheme of quantum numbers.  The quantum number system describes the allowable states electrons may assume in an atom.  To use the analogy of an amphitheater, quantum numbers describe how many rows and seats there are.  Individual electrons may be described by the combination of quantum numbers they possess, like a spectator in an amphitheater assigned to a particular row and seat. Like spectators in an amphitheater moving between seats and/or rows, electrons may change their statuses, given the presence of available spaces for them to fit, and available energy.  Since shell level is closely related to the amount of energy that an electron possesses, ""leaps"" between shell (and even subshell) levels requires transfers of energy.  If an electron is to move into a higher-order shell, it requires that additional energy be given to the electron from an external source.  Using the amphitheater analogy, it takes an increase in energy for a person to move into a higher row of seats, because that person must climb to a greater height against the force of gravity.  Conversely, an electron ""leaping"" into a lower shell gives up some of its energy, like a person jumping down into a lower row of seats, the expended energy manifesting as heat and sound released upon impact. Not all ""leaps"" are equal.  Leaps between different shells requires a substantial exchange of energy, while leaps between subshells or between orbitals require lesser exchanges. When atoms combine to form substances, the outermost shells, subshells, and orbitals merge, providing a greater number of available energy levels for electrons to assume.  When large numbers of atoms exist in close proximity to each other, these available energy levels form a nearly continuous band wherein electrons may transition. It is the width of these bands and their proximity to existing electrons that determines how mobile those electrons will be when exposed to an electric field.  In metallic substances, empty bands overlap with bands containing electrons, meaning that electrons may move to what would normally be (in the case of a single atom) a higher-level state with little or no additional energy imparted.  Thus, the outer electrons are said to be ""free,"" and ready to move at the beckoning of an electric field. Band overlap will not occur in all substances, no matter how many atoms are in close proximity to each other.  In some substances, a substantial gap remains between the highest band containing electrons (the so-called valence band) and the next band, which is empty (the so-called conduction band).  As a result, valence electrons are ""bound"" to their constituent atoms and cannot become mobile within the substance without a significant amount of imparted energy.  These substances are electrical insulators: Materials that fall within the category of semiconductors have a narrow gap between the valence and conduction bands.  Thus, the amount of energy required to motivate a valence electron into the conduction band where it becomes mobile is quite modest: At low temperatures, there is little thermal energy available to push valence electrons across this gap, and the semiconducting material acts as an insulator.  At higher temperatures, though, the ambient thermal energy becomes sufficient to force electrons across the gap, and the material will conduct electricity. It is difficult to predict the conductive properties of a substance by examining the electron configurations of its constituent atoms.  While it is true that the best metallic conductors of electricity (silver, copper, and gold) all have outer s subshells with a single electron, the relationship between conductivity and valence electron count is not necessarily consistent: Likewise, the electron band configurations produced by compounds of different elements defies easy association with the electron configurations of its constituent elements.

Years ago, before international tourism set foot in Iceland, we Icelanders only traveled during the summers—around the country and into the Highland for camping and hiking. Summer in Iceland stretches over three months, from the beginning of June to the end of August. And even though summer only lasts for three months, it is by far the best time to explore the country. It is the most favorable time for any road trip—be it a tour of the Westfjords, the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, and Reykjanes Peninsula or just a simple drive to the Ring Road, or even a day-long excursion to one or more of the many magnificent natural wonders it is host to. There are numerous reasons for this period being the most suitable time to visit Iceland. Since Iceland is situated in the planet’s northernmost part, hinging the arctic circle, this place is never warm, even during summers, unlike most countries worldwide. Additionally, the weather here always remains rather unpredictable. In the summer months, however, the temperature varies from around 6 °C to 18 °C (42 °F to 60 °F). The weather itself stays relatively calm and stable—the gusts of winds and rainy days are but an occasional occurrence (the precipitation is around 6 mm–10mm). More importantly, during summer, all the roads are open, well-maintained, and comfortable to drive on. Visibility on the roads is good, and it is by far the best time to drive around the Icelandic countryside. It would also do you some good to remember that Iceland is an extremely small island, and you can easily drive from one end of the country to another, all in a day’s time. The distance from Reykjavík to one of the easternmost towns Egillsstaðir is only about 650 kilometers (around 403 miles)! If you follow the weather forecast, you can easily change your travel plans without muddling up your itinerary. Since most travelers visit Iceland to feast their eyes on one or more of its natural wonders, summer is the most beautiful season for this indulgence. In summers, everything in Iceland is blooming and bursting with colors. It is also the most suitable time for camping and any other kind of outdoor activities. All restaurants, hotels, camping grounds stay open in every town and village along the coastline. It is during summers when the Icelandic wilderness, the Icelandic Highland, are also accessible by travelers. And, of course, last but not the least of its lures, this is also the time of the year when Iceland receives 24 hours of daylight and basks in the warmth of the midnight sun. For all these reasons and more, summer is truly the most wonderful time to visit Iceland. And, as for families, those travelling with young adventurous minds, the country offers the most unique vacation spot. Everything that the country has to offer in terms of activities and adventure tours is available in the summer months. It is a great time to watch whales and puffins go for sea tours and tread on glaciers. It is an excellent time to hike, and is, at times, the only time to enjoy these exceptional activities. The greatest variety of short tours to exotic places, spectacular landscapes, or highland adventures can be relished at this time. This is also the most excellent time to enjoy Reykjavík—the one-of-its-kind small city with its colorful nightlife that unfolds on bright and sunny nights. With Iceland’s ever-growing tourist appeal, finding proper and affordable accommodation during summer can be very difficult. Often, most, if not all, hotels and guest houses are more or less fully booked for the summer in March and April. So, if you are planning to travel during the summer months, you must book early. Accommodation is expensive at this time, only getting pricier as summer approaches. One alternative, of course, is to camp at some of the spectacular sites around the country. It is definitely one of the advantages you can enjoy during summer. And for this, you should remember that almost every town and village in Iceland boasts a good camping site and great swimming pools with great showers. Anyone who is planning to have a great vacation in Iceland should visit the country in the summer months. It is the best time to witness its most fascinating natural wonders, bask in its exquisite weather, enjoy long hours of daylight, and make the most of hikes and camping in its remarkable courtside. It is also the perfect time to enjoy the tranquil places and personal sanctuaries, appreciate the beauty of the highland, and to explore the entire country overall. It is also the only time when every service and every tour operator is open for business along the coastline as well as the inlands. Like summer, the fall or autumn is also an excellent season for visiting Iceland, but in a different way and for different reasons. Around this time, the weather starts getting colder, and the days shorter. But this is also the season that offers spectacular light and clear skies— the time when frost and snow is just approaching. Autumn or fall begins in September and stays till the middle of November. The temperature remains at around 1 °C to 9 °C (34 °F to 48 °F). During this period, travelers can expect snowfall, since the temperature plummets considerably by this time, especially in late October and November (rainfall is around 9 mm– 16mm). As you can see, compared to summer temperatures, the autumn temperatures show a considerable decline. Most roads are open and fairly easy to traverse, apart from the possibility of slippery roads if the temperature falls below 0 °C (32 °F). This is particularly true for roads at higher altitudes, mountain passes, and the Highland roads. Driving is not as easy as it is in summer, requiring more preparation and caution. But, it is also important to understand that most of the highland roads close in late September or at least around the beginning of October. Despite all the limitations, the season also offers some advantages! For starters, the sky is mostly much clearer during the cold season. For professional photographers, September and October are the most suitable months for photography in Iceland. The landscape still presents itself in all its colors, and the weather conditions and lighting enhances everything. It is probably the most excellent time for photography, as the golden hour in this part of the world is longer than that in many other countries, thus offering photographers some great opportunities. Moreover, often in the months of September and October, a film of snow covers the mountains, especially the peaks, awarding the landscape and some of the natural wonders with a magnificent backdrop. The country sees fewer travelers at this time, and some of the popular destinations are not as crowded as during the summer months. For those who can plan a trip in autumn, this is a splendid opportunity; and you can also pay homage to the Highland more or less throughout September and even in October. This is also the season when you start to see the Northern Lights as the days become progressively shorter and darkness descends earlier in the evenings. In September and October, the twilight zone is between 9 am and 10 am. Some of the most spectacular Northern Lights sightings in Iceland are seen and photographed in late September and October. Waiting to see the spectacular lights is more comfortable in fall, as the temperature is much lower in October, compared to in January and February, when many visitors tend to look and wait for the Northern Lights. During this time of the year, most of the camping areas are closed, and camping is not a recommended pursuit. It is, of course, possible, if you are well prepared with tents and sleeping bags that can sustain freezing temperatures. That’s why most visitors prefer to find hotels or any cozier indoor accommodation. Iceland has never been considered a pleasant place for camping for the average person, unless one is visiting in the summer. Even in autumn, the weather is less predictable compared to summers, and anyone would like to be indoors as the weather grows colder. Although I have put autumn in second place, it is still a great time to visit Iceland. The advantages for photographers is obvious. Moreover, this period offers less congestion of roads, which is essential at a time when most of the natural wonders are still accessible. This time of the year is probably less expensive in terms of accommodation, but simultaneously, you cannot take advantage of the possibility of lowering your travel budget by camping. The added attraction of witnessing and photographing the Northern Lights is definitely an advantage fall trips have over summer ones. But, if you are not specifically interested in photography, summer is probably a better choice for you. The period from the middle of October till February is a somewhat difficult time visiting Iceland if you are planning a vacation. The main reason behind this is the weather, which is often quite harsh and unpredictable, with strong winds and snowstorms. You must consider these factors if you plan to visit Iceland during winter. There is, of course, a marked difference between winter and summer seasons in the northern hemisphere. Although complicated, visiting Iceland during winter also has some exciting advantages. Even though the weather is sometimes quite harsh during winters, the temperature range remains surprisingly narrow. The temperature varies around –3°C to 7°C (26 °F to 42 °F). Often during winters, the temperature stays around 3 °C (32 °F) for days and even weeks. But, during this time, you can expect snowfall, since the temperature obviously falls considerably compared to summers (rainfall is around 12 mm–16 mm at this time). More importantly, the chilly winds exaggerates the temperature. Moreover, driving in winters is quite different from other seasons. It is simply difficult, as the roads are slippery, especially those beyond towns and villages. If you intend to see some of Iceland’s natural wonders, keep in mind that many of the interesting ones are not accessible at this time, and the roads leading to them that stay open and accessible are difficult to drive on. Opting for a guided tour with drivers who are familiar with the roads and trained to drive in winters would be a safer alternative. Iceland does offer some exciting options during winter. Frozen waterfalls are a spectacular site and an enticing motive for photography and an excellent background for selfies. Hot springs with frozen surroundings offer another such spot. However, your vacations at this time can be more challenging and require a bit more planning as many restaurants and services remain closed in some of the towns and villages around the country. Although, in the capital, Reykjavík, and the surrounding city area, everything stays open. In these months, camping is not possible as very few camping sites stay open. Camping is only possible for those in camping sites with access to electricity. Despite all of this, the winter months do have a lot to offer, and one of our most famous attractions during winter is the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights. Iceland is a great place to witness the spectacle of the Northern Lights, probably one of the best places on the planet, as we claim and discuss in our article. Experiencing the Northern lights in a country like Iceland where the Aurora Borealis is extremely distinct and prominent certainly allows an unforgettable experience. And, although many natural wonders are not accessible during this season, some are. Visiting waterfalls, such as Skógafoss, Seljalandsfoss, Goðafoss, and Gullfoss, or geothermal areas and geysers is a spectacular experience in winter. So, there are indeed some advantages this season offers, and although the weather can be harsh, it can also remain relatively calm and pleasant for days, and the sunlight during winter is often quite distinct in the short days, with its subdued pink glow. Although a more difficult time to visit and one that takes more careful planning, winter has many advantages. Visiting Reykjavík on New Year’s eve and witnessing the most spectacular firework show on the planet is also an attraction in favor of visiting Iceland in winter. Winter in Iceland is more or less considered a low season, although, it does, in fact, remain surprisingly frequented. It is better to get good hotel prices in winter, as there are more offers at this time. There is also better availability in Reykjavík and more so outside the capital city area. However, despite this, it is safer to book your hotel or guest house weeks in advance. It is usually not a good idea to come to Iceland without booking a hotel or accommodation before arriving. Winter is an adventurous time to visit Iceland. It is the perfect time to see the Northern Lights, the time to visit the Ice Caves, and a time for harsh environment and unpredictable weather. But, even though it may be a little tougher, if you have the proper gear, clothing, and conveyance, it will be quite different from anything you can experience. If you know what to expect and make adequate preparations, you can end up having an incredible vacation. The months of March till May are the least interesting, and in the opinion of the natives, the least favorable time to visit Iceland. Most of the landscape is gray and colorless at this time. The island is emerging from the clutches of winter during these months, and all the places stay a little wet and muddy, as the winter snow melts. The grass is lifeless, and most of the vegetation does not gain vitality and color. Some tracks to important natural wonders remain slippery and muddy and some even stay closed. The temperature at this time of year is around –3°C in March up to 12°C in May (26 °F to 53 °F). However, during spring, the weather stays reasonably warm and stable, and rainfall is around 9 mm–12 mm. More importantly, although many roads remain open, all of the highland roads are closed, and many mountain passes and mountain roads remain closed or difficult to navigate. Serious maintenance of most of the roads after winter is resumed in May, so most of the gravel roads are difficult to drive on. This only means that there are all kinds of road and driving-related limitations in Spring. Although at this time, the natural wonders can be enjoyed. Everything is, of course, relatively a bit dull, and in many places, the snowdrifts are yet to melt by this time. Consequently, some of those places are either hidden or half-covered in snow. The overall landscape is a bit muddy and dirty, and for photographers, this is not a good time to visit Iceland. It is an excellent time for visiting the Blue Lagoon though, to visit museums, drive around the Golden Circle, stay in Reykjavík, and drive around the Reykjanes Peninsula, as many of the exciting tourist attractions are situated by the shore and respond faster to the change in season than places at higher altitude. So, there is a possibility that some of the natural wonders such as waterfalls and basalt column sites will be in the process of acquiring interesting shapes at this time. But, Iceland is still not as exciting or beautiful as it is during summer. During this time of the year, it is relatively easy to catch a good deal for accommodation. You can find some excellent places outside Reykjavík if you are traveling the south shore or Snæfellsnes Peninsula, compared to summers. So there are, of course, some advantages spring offers. On the whole, it is a relatively uninspiring time to visit Iceland. There are a few things that stand out, such as the marvelous natural wonders in summers, Northern Lights in autumn, and the frozen waterfalls and ice caves in winter. But, still, the days are agreeably long, and if you stick to places by the shore and places you can reach by asphalt roads, you will find lesser crowds and more affordable accommodation during this season. As for those who really want to enjoy the best Iceland has to offer, I would advise them to avoid visiting at this time of the year. So, when you plan to visit Iceland, you need to consider and understand exactly what you desire. Travelling to see a natural wonder or some exciting place, only to find it is not accessible and will not be so for months upon approaching is not a pleasant prospect. Just as you cannot drive in the Highland during winters, you do not visit Iceland during summers to see the Northern Lights. Find out what you are looking for and what you want to see before you organize a tour that suits your interest, specifically keeping in mind the best season to visit Iceland.","The Easter Lily Cactus is a night bloomer. Flowers open in the late evening and start to wither on next day. They can appear again and again from late spring throughout summer. Echinopsis subdenudata does best in full or partial sun. During summer it can be placed outside in partial shade to full sun. There it has to be slowly accustomed to the sunlight, which is no longer filtered through a window. In very hot regions it should be protected from the midday sun during the midsummer days. Regular mixes for cacti and succulents can be used or a mixture of regular potting soil, bird sand and pumice (2:1:1). During growing season allow the soil only to nearly dry between the waterings. During winter keep it dry if the Easter Lily Cactus is placed cool at 1 to 5 °C (34 to 41 °F) and also nearly dry at 5 to 15 °C (41 to 59 °F). If Echinopsis subdenudata spends the summer in the garden, the pot should not stand in a saucer or overpot so that the rainwater can run off. Every 4th to 8th week if Echinopsis subdenudata is in active growth. Feed with cacti liquid fertilizer or a standard liquid fertilizer at half strength. A new bought or recently repotted plant don’t need to be fed for the first year. The Easter Lily Cactus does best with a cool winter rest period at 3 to 10 °C (37 to 50 °F) but also can be placed at 10 to 15 (50 to 59 °F). Minimum temperature is 1 °C (34 °F). Seeds or pups.",,,

The fifth season of Finnish Idol premiered on February 3, 2011 on MTV3. Nina Tapio and Jone Nikula returned as judges, and Sami Pitkämö replaced Patric Sarin as a judge.  Heikki Paasonen returned as the show's host, but his co-hosts from the previous season did not return as they were replaced by Niina Herala. Idols tekee hyvää, a Finnish version of the hugely acclaimed American Idol Gives Back program, was held for the first time on April 24, 2011. The concert was hosted by Heikki Paasonen and Idols' original hostess Ellen Jokikunnas, who replaced Niina Herala for that one episode. This season also includes a new show called Idols Studio, which replaces Idols Extra. Hosted by Idols Extra's earlier host Janne Kataja, the show includes conversations with varying guests. The show is aired on Saturday evenings at 7:30 pm (earlier 6:30 pm) EET on MTV3. There were twelve semifinalists, six females and males. An ice pop is a water-based frozen snack. It is also referred to as a popsicle (Canada, U.S.), freeze pop (Ireland, U.S.), ice lolly (United Kingdom, Ireland), ice block, icy pole (parts of Australia and New Zealand), or chihiro (Cayman Islands). It is made by freezing flavored liquid (such as fruit juice) around a stick, generally resembling a tongue depressor. Often, the juice is colored artificially. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. When an ice pop does not have a stick, it is called, among other names, a freezie. Frank Epperson of Oakland, California, popularized ice pops after patenting the concept of ""frozen ice on a stick"" in 1923. He initially called it the Epsicle.  A couple of years later, Epperson sold the rights to the invention and the Popsicle brand to the Joe Lowe Company in New York City. Epperson claimed to have first created an ice pop in 1905 at the age of 11 when he accidentally left a glass of powdered soda and water with a mixing stick in it on his porch during a cold night, a story printed on the back panel of Popscicle brand treat boxes in the 80's and 90's. However, the evidence for this is scant. POP is the eleventh studio album released by Joachim Witt in 2004. Pop is the final album by Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project, released on 28 March 2000 on Mille Plateaux. At the time of its release, reviews noted 'a striking left turn' in the sound, compared to other Gas releases; the album sounds considerably crisper, with a less muffled kickdrum and less of the 'underwater' quality present on other releases under the name. Like all Gas albums, the tracks are untitled. Pop was named the sixth best album of the 2000s by Resident Advisor, and the 85th best of the decade by online magazine Pitchfork Media.","The Bolo Tie was invented on horseback in 1949 by one Victor Cedarstaff of Wickenburg, Arizona. Victor was out riding with a group of his friends in the Bradshaw Mountains when a gust of wind blew off his hat. He ended up with his hat strap around his neck and the silver strap buckle hanging in front. He thought it looked pretty good. Being a jewelry maker, he worked on the idea and came up with a nifty piece of neckwear. He sought a name for his invention. He first called it the “piggin necklet”. For obvious reasons the name did not stick. He eventually decided to call it the Bolo Tie, because of its resemblance to the Argentine Goucho’s baleadora weapon which is used like a lariat for handling cattle. Victor went on obtain patent number 3,126,603 for the unique bauble. The Arizona Legislature, recognizing a good thing when they saw it, passed a bill making the “Bolo Tie” the official neckwear of the State of Arizona. The bill was signed into law by Governor Jack Williams in 1971. New Mexico followed suit in 1987. The Bolo Tie goes by several names such as the “Bola Tie” and the “String Tie”. In England it is called the “Bootlace Tie”. Texans, whose humility is the least of their virtues, called it the “Texas Tie”. Though there are many jewelry makers who craft Bolo’s, most of them are now made by Native Americans. The Navajos were the first to produce these ties, followed quickly by the Zuni and the Hopi. Navajo Bolos are usually made of Sterling or Nickle Silver, with a single polished, naturally shaped turquoise stone. Zuni bolos, on the other hand, are usually made as a tiny mosaic of cut stones arranged into a design. The design is often an Animal Fetish. For horsemen, cowboys and wannabes, the Bolo Tie is a necessary accessory of the wardrobe. Don’t leave home without it. Your email address will not be published.

However, there are also times when a great invention can be a complete fluke. Read on to find out about some of the most important accidental inventions and discoveries of all time. And so, without further ado, here are some of the top 10 accidental inventions of all time. This list is far from exhaustive and is in no particular order. Millions of people pop open a box of corn flakes each morning, but the popular cereal almost never happened. W. K. Kellogg along with his brother Dr. John Harvey Kellogg developed the first edible corn flake product accidentally. In 1898, while conducting research about patient's diets at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan. Dr. Kellogg first baked a wheat dough at extremely high heat to break down starch contained in the grain into the simple sugar dextrose. John Kellogg called this baking process dextrinization. He and Will worked for years to come up with the recipe for dextrinized flaked cereals — working first with wheat and then corn. According to the company's origin story, around 1877, Dr. Kellogg created a mixture of flour, oats, and cornmeal, which he baked twice and broke into small pieces for serving (after a patient broke her tooth on a biscuit version). He believed that by baking the whole grains at high temperatures, the starch contained in the grain broke down into the simple sugar dextrose and became more easily digestible — thanks to a process he called “dextrinization,"". The company claims that one night in 1898, a batch of wheat-based cereal dough was accidentally left out for an extended period of time, causing it to ferment. When rolled out into thin sheets and baked, the slightly moldy dough produced perfect large, thin, crispy flakes. Over the next several years, Will Kellogg kept experimenting with the recipe and eventually found that corn, rather than wheat, produced even crunchier, crispier flakes. At first, the cereals were ready to be eaten without the addition of sugar or milk. However, W. K. Kellogg noticed the potential benefits of combining the cereal with milk. He was also a pioneer in the mass marketing of the product to the public. In the 1900s, to help consumers distinguish his product from 42 other companies with similar products, W.K. signed on each package, saying that these Corn Flakes were the ""The Original."" Now, that breakfast food has been transformed into different flavor varieties and consumed by millions each year. For decades, the brand Super Glue and similar brands of super-sticky glues have been used to repair any and all broken items around the house. The chemical name of the actual glue itself is actually cyanoacrylate. Cyanoacrylates were actually discovered in 1942, when a team of scientists at the B.F. Goodrich Company, led by Harry Coover Jr, were working to make clear plastic gun sights during World War II. They stumbled on the formulation for cyanoacrylates, but rejected it for use in gun sights because it was too sticky. In 1951, while working as researchers for Eastman Kodak, Coover and a colleague, Fred Joyner, realized that cyanoacrylate itself had commercial potential. Dr. Coover and fellow researcher Fred Joyner were testing hundreds of compounds and when they spread the 910th compound, cyanoacrylate, between two lenses, they found that the lenses were not detachable. They developed the formula for sale as an adhesive, and it was first sold in 1958 under the title ""Eastman #910"" Though Super Glue wasn't patented by him, Dr. Coover held 460 other patents. Of all the modern kitchen appliances, the microwave oven is a notable invention. After all, it makes cooking many types of foods very quick and easy. But how many know it was invented accidentally? Its inventor, Percy Spencer, was an engineer at Raytheon. In 1945, he noticed that a candy bar in his pocket started to melt while he was working near the magnetrons that produced microwaves. Later, Spencer patented the invention along with his employer. The first microwave brand was called ""RadaRange"" and it was launched for commercial use after two years. Percy Spencer was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame of 1999. Did you know that a wrong resistor helped in the invention of the implantable pacemaker? While working as an assistant professor in electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, Wilson Greatbatch designed the first practical implantable pacemaker. When he was working on building a heart rhythm recording device, he completed the circuit using a wrong-sized resistor. The oscillator required a 10 KΩ resistor, but Greatbatch misread the color coding and got a 1 MΩ resistor by mistake. The new circuit emitted intermittent electrical pulses, rather than continuous pulse, and Greatbatch immediately realized that the device could be used to drive a human heart. On May 7, 1958, Veterans Administration hospital doctors demonstrated that this two cubic inch device could take control of a dog’s heartbeat. Greatbatch patented more than 325 inventions, among which was a long-life lithium battery. No accidental invention list is complete without a mention of Penicillin, which aided in the development of modern medicine. A Scottish bacteriologist at St. Mary’s Hospital, Sir Alexander Fleming introduced penicillin that cures bacterial infections. As the story goes, after returning from a summer vacation on September 3, 1928, Dr. Fleming noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated his Petri dishes and prevented the growth of the staphylococci. Unfortunately, this story is only partly true. Fleming did notice a mold that had grown in a petri dish, preventing the growth of bacteria, but it was not immediately obvious to him that the mold would be useful. This is because he did not know what exactly was preventing the bacterial growth. In fact, it took around 14 more years, and the work of many researchers, to isolate the active agent preventing the growth of bacteria - penicillium - and to make enough for use. The first person treated with penicillin in 1941 was policeman Albert Alexander, who had an uncontrolled bacterial infection following a scratch from a rose. He responded dramatically to the penicillin, but relapsed ten days later. The researchers had only managed to make a small amount of the drug, and although they recycled some from Alexander's urine, he died when supplies ran out. In March 1942, Anne Miller became the first civilian patient to be treated with penicillin and survive — 14 years after its invention. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, and engineer devoted his time and life to the study of explosives. In their efforts to stabilize nitroglycerin, a highly unstable and explosive liquid, Nobel and laboratory workers experienced several accidents, one of which resulted in an explosion in 1864 that destroyed Nobel's factory and left his brother Emil dead. Nobel realized that nitroglycerine had to be absorbed by some kind of porous material in order to make it easier to handle. During a stay in Germany, he found nearby a type of porous, absorbent sand or diatomaceous earth, known in German as Kieselguhr. When nitroglycerine was absorbed by the Kieselguhr, it formed a stable paste that could be safely kneaded and shaped, as well as transported, and even ignited, without triggering an explosion. Nobel combined the stabilized nitroglycerin paste with a type of detonator he’d invented earlier to create dynamite, named for the Greek word for power, dynamis. He patented his product in 1867. Dynamite was soon used in blasting tunnels, cutting canals, building railways and roads, and also during wartime. To promote peace in the world, in November 1895, Nobel established the Nobel Prizes in his Will. Of course, x-rays are a phenomenon of the natural world, and thus can't be invented. However, they were accidentally discovered. The invisible was made visible in 1895. The discovery of the X-ray was undoubtedly a major advancement in the field of medicine. The credit goes to physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. While testing whether cathode rays could pass through glass, he noticed a glow coming from a nearby chemically coated screen. Through experimentation, he found that the mysterious light would pass through most substances, but leave shadows of solid objects. Because he did not know what the rays were, he called them X-rays. Roentgen found that X-rays would also pass through human tissue, allowing the bones and tissue beneath to made visible. By 1897, during the Balkan war, X-rays were already being used to find bullets and broken bones inside patients. In 1901, he received the first Nobel prize in physics for his work. It all started at the Du Pont Company's Jackson Laboratory in New Jersey on April 6, 1938. Chemist Roy J. Plunkett was working with gasses related to Freon refrigerants. Plunkett had produced a hundred pounds of tetrafluoroethylene gas (TFE) and stored it in small cylinders at dry-ice temperatures before chlorinating it. On checking a frozen canister, he and his associates discovered that the sample had polymerized spontaneously into a white, waxy solid to form polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Intrigued by the mysterious chemical, Plunkett began to experiment and categorize its properties. Plunkett realized that the TFE had polymerized to produce this substance — later named Teflon. Du Pont assigned other teams to further investigate the substance, and Plunkett was transferred to the tetraethyl lead division of DuPont, which produced the additive that for many years boosted gasoline octane levels. Teflon was trademarked by Du Pont in 1945, and proved to be significant in areas such as aerospace, communications, electronics, industrial processes. Today, Teflon is prominent in non-stick cookware, soil and stain repellant for fabrics and textile products. PTFE revolutionized the plastics industry. Plunkett was recognized for his numerous marvelous inventions and was inducted into the Plastics Hall of Fame in 1973, and, in 1985, into the National Inventors' Hall of Fame. From the storage of medicine to shelter and transportation, polymers are responsible for countless products we use daily. Through the invention of Bakelite, the inventor Leo Hendrik Baekeland helped in the establishment of the modern plastic industry. Bakelite was discovered in 1905 after Baekland failed to create a saleable synthetic substitute for shellac. Baekeland's synthetic shellac, ""Novolak,"" was a combination of formaldehyde and phenol which failed to catch on as a shellac substitute. But while experimenting with the Novolak formulation, he noticed that controlling the temperature and pressure applied to the two compounds, and by mixing it with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust, resulted in a material that was moldable yet strong, as well as non-conductive and heat-resistant. He called his invention Bakelite, and referred to it as ""the material of 1,000 uses"" — a considerable understatement, as it turned out. Of course, the idea of frozen treats on a stick were not unique. But the Popsicle brand ice pop was invented accidentally by an 11-year-old. One night in 1905, 11-year-old Frank Epperson mixed the soda powder and water with a wooden stirrer. But the California native left the glass outside in the cold overnight. In the morning, he noticed that the soda mixture was frozen solid. By running the glass under hot water and using the stick as a handle, he removed the ice pop out of the class. With this great idea on his hands, Frank named the treats ""Epsicles"" and started selling them around the neighborhood Many years later, Epperson's children urged him to change the ice pop's name to what they called it: a Pop's 'Sicle, or Popsicle. In 1923, Epperson expanded to selling the treats at a nearby amusement park and filed the patent for his invention the following year. A couple of years later, a broke Epperson sold the rights to the Joe Lowe Company in New York, who marketed it under the brand name Popsicle. It was a huge success. It is estimated that in the 1920s, around 8,000 popsicles were sold in a single day in Brooklyn’s Coney Island amusement park alone. Popsicle is a brand name, but the concept of frozen juice on a stick is called by different names around the world. In the USA it's a popsicle, but in England, it’s an ice lolly. In New Zealand, they are icy poles and the Irish call them freeze pops. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is all for today. These are just some of the many inventions from around the world that were created completely by accident. Are there any other notable examples we have missed?

Noone, Phd. invented a teaching tool formed as a clear-plastic palm-size polyhedron (dodecahedron) with questions and information printed on it to help the user solve problems and enhance his or her creative thinking. He called it The Polysolver. Dr. Noone also authored books including Creative Problem Solving, a thesis suggesting how to enhance problem solving ability by using various techniques such as: mind-mapping, association, quantum-leap thinking, and turning problems into provocative questions. The book is out of print now and the teaching tool is no longer available, but I recently stumbled on a Polysolver, micro-stamped “Made in France.” I could not help but wonder why it disappeared from the retail marketplace not many years after its introduction in 1983, so I put it under the Noetitek™ “microscope” for a post mortem examination. Each face of this intriguing three-inch-diameter artifact, composed of twelve pentagonal faces, displays a directive, except for one face which provides instructions for using the actionable ideas presented on the others. This side says: The Polysolver, and it gives these instructions: Write problem as a question. Run problem through each side. Do not limit thinking. Write down solutions. Go for quantity. Do not criticize any idea. Evaluate each idea by time, cost, ease, effect, risk. Choose best ideas and prioritize. List steps and deadlines for each. Do it. Compare—My problem (x) to anything (y): (x) is like (y). List the characteristics of (y). What do they suggest to solve my problem? Make a list of words. Ask what ideas do each suggest? Or, do two lists side by side and randomly pair words for ideas. All the actionable ideas listed have practical utility; it was not for lack of that quality that The Polysolver was discontinued. Nonetheless, inspection of the list using Noetitek™ reveals incompleteness, some redundancy, and, most important for us: the fact that the full spectrum of creation principles is not represented. Therefore, to use those eleven concepts alone means impeding full-spectrum creative thinking and missing a lot of golden opportunities. A few ideas that could be added to a schema of this nature, without giving much thought, are: Revolutionize, and Separate. The one that we would eliminate is Change, considering that all but one of the ideas on the list already represent a type of change. Improving The Polysolver in keeping with Dr. Noone’s system would require a much larger polyhedron and the use of two hands, whereas a Noetitek™ teaching tool could be rendered upon the faces of a smaller dodecahedron and be complete in terms of bringing all facets of primal power to bear on fulfillment of desire. In “Critique of Popular Meta-tools,” posted at the inception of this blog, in February 2009, we reported that we have examined numerous meta-tools over many years and none allows for the achievement of top-quality results available through using Noetitek™’s cabinet of tools; yet, during the 1980s The Polysolver was among the best available. In applying our mind-tools, we prefer not looking at situations as problems to be solved but as useful launchpads for creating new and more satisfying experiences. Desirable situations are as worthy of scrutiny as undesirable situations for those attracted to the leading edge of life. To approach something as a problem is to see it through the two-fisted filter of lack and limitation that blacken the inner eyes and bar creative insight.
