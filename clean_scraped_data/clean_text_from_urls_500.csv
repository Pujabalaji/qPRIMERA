I mean what’s actually UP with that cover? I’ll check out Wikipedia, my fact checking cuz. They’re always coming with some sociologically tenacious levity lacing their objective fact. Maybe I’ll get some perspective on other people’s reactions. It would have been an even more radical cover back in the day. Ah, there’s even a section of the blurb on “Artwork and packaging.” Wow, one stop shopping… no further research should even be necessary! Hooray for Wikipedia! Ok here we go. (Wikipedia): The cover art for Houses of the Holy was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke’s novel Childhood’s End. The cover is a collage of several photographs which were taken at the Giant’s Causeway, Northern Ireland, by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. This location was chosen ahead of an alternative one in Peru which had also been considered. (Wikipedia): The photo shoot featured two children, Stefan and Samantha Gates. It was a frustrating affair over the course of ten days. (Me): Why, did they not let you sick fu**s pork them in the a** or something? The flat tone of this blurb about the Houses of the Holy “art” is the most repugnant thing I’ve seen since I first saw a girl wearing yoga pants in a public place (which was my cousin, very awkwardly and unfortunately enough). (Wikipedia): Shooting was done first thing in the morning and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. (Me): Haha, good lord. It’s an album with a song called “The Rain Song” on it, ruined because of“constant rain and clouds.” What will happen next? Also that’s probably longer than Nirvana took for the entire writing and recording of Bleach. (Wikipedia): The photos of the two children were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results were unsatisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created a suitable album cover. (Me): Umm… excuse me… er… kind sir… uh… bearfu**er… um… IT’S A BUNCH OF NAKED FIVE YEAR OLD GIRLS CLIMBING UP A MOUNTAIN. YOU EVEN SEE ONE OF THE GIRL’S A** CRACK. ALSO JIMMY PAGE HAS A REGRETTABLE HISTORY OF GETTING ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH YOUNGER CO-EDS. ALSO THE BAND IN THE FINAL SONG “THE OCEAN” EVEN MAKES A LYRICAL REFERENCE TO “A GIRL WHO WON MY HEART / SHE IS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD AND IT’S A REAL FINE WAY TO START”, A SONG WHICH IS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ONLY COMPOUNDED BY THE FURTHER CHILD PROBLEMS ROBERT PLANT WOULD HAVE WITH HIS SON DYING THREE YEARS LATER OF A STOMACH INFECTION. From the way you write this blurb you’d think it was a picture of varnish covering an oaken table in Ohio. (Wikipedia): Page has stated that the album cover was the second version submitted by Hipgnosis. (Me): “Hipgnosis”? I won’t even ask.","Houses of the Holy is the fifth studio album by English rock band Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records on 28 March 1973. It is the first Led Zeppelin album composed of entirely original material, and represents a musical turning point for the band, who had begun to record songs with more layering and production techniques. During the sessions, Led Zeppelin also recorded a song named “Houses of the Holy”, and planned to make it the album’s title track. However, the band eventually decided that it didn’t fit in, and the song was instead released on their next album, Physical Graffiti. The cover art for Houses of the Holy was inspired by the ending of Arthur C. Clarke’s novel Childhood’s End, which involves several hundred million naked children, only slightly and physically resembling the human race in basic forms. The cover is a collage of several photographs which were taken at the Giant’s Causeway, Northern Ireland, by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. This location was chosen ahead of an alternative one in Peru which was being considered. Upon its release, the album received some mixed reviews, with much criticism from the music press being directed at the off-beat nature of tracks such as “The Crunge” and “D’yer Mak’er”. However, the album was very successful commercially, entering the UK chart at number one, while in America its 39-week run (2 of them spent at number one) on the Billboard Top 40 was their longest since their third album.

when was new hampshire founded and by whom,"The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on the division in 1629 of a land grant given in 1622 by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason (former governor of Newfoundland) and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire by Mason after the English county of Hampshire, one of the first Saxon shires. Hampshire was itself named after the port of Southampton, which was known previously as simply ""Hampton"".","New Hampshire  U.S.                 Senator: The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on the division in 1629 of a land grant given seven years previously by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire after the English county of Hampshire, one of the first Saxon shires. Hampshire was itself named after the port of Southampton, which was known previously as simply ""Hampton"". New Hampshire was first settled by Europeans at Odiorne's Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) by a group of fishermen from England under David Thompson in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. The settlers built a fort, manor house and other buildings, some for fish processing, on Flake Hill. They called the settlement Pannaway Plantation. In 1623 the English explorer Christopher Levett, an associate of Gorges and a member of the Council for New England, wrote of visiting Thomson at his Pannaway Plantation. The first native New Hampshirite, John Thompson, was born there. (Note: this was the conclusion of several early historians. However, we now know that John Thompson was baptised at St. Andrew's Parish in Plymouth, England in 1619.  New Hampshire was one of the original 13 colonies.","New Hampshire is a state of the United States of America located in the country's Northeastern region. Considered to be part of New England, New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on a land grant given in 1622 by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire after the English county of Hampshire. It was first settled at Odiorne's Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) by a group of fishermen from England under David Thompson[1] in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. The settlers built a fort, manor house and other buildings, some for fish processing, on Flake Hill. They called the settlement Pannaway Plantation. The first native Newhampshireman, John Thompson, was born there. (Note: this was the conclusion of several early historians. However, we now know that John Thompson was baptised at St. Andrew's Parish in Plymouth, England in 1619. Most likely the first English child born in New Hampshire was Agnes Hilton, daughter of William Hilton, born at Dover in 1625.) New Hampshire was one of the original 13 colonies. David Thompson had been sent by Mason, to be followed a few years later by Edward and William Hilton. They led an expedition to the vicinity of Dover, which they called Northam. Mason died in 1635 without ever seeing the colony he founded. Settlers from Pannaway,  moving to the Portsmouth region later and combining with an expedition of the new Laconia Company (formed 1629) under Captain Neal, called their new settlement Strawbery Banke. In 1638 Exeter was founded by John Wheelwright. In 1631, Captain Thomas Wiggin served as the first governor of the Upper Plantation (comprising modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham). All the towns agreed to unite in 1639, but meanwhile Massachusetts had claimed the territory. In 1641 an agreement was reached with Massachusetts to come under its jurisdiction. Home rule of the towns was allowed. In 1653 Strawbery Bank petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts to change its name to Portsmouth, which was granted. The relationship between Massachusetts and the independent Newhampshiremen was controversial and tenuous. In 1679 the king separated them, and Upper Plantation became the ""Royal Province"" with John Cutt as governor. They were reunited in 1686 and redivided in 1691. The ""Royal Province"" continued until 1698 when it came once more under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts with Joseph Dudley as Governor. In 1741 New Hampshire returned to its royal provincial status with a governor of its own, Benning Wentworth, who was its governor from 1741 to 1766. New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted with the British rule in the American Revolution. It was the first state to declare its independence in January 1776, meaning that for the following six months until the founding of the United States of America with the Declaration of Independence, New Hampshire was the first post-colonial nation-state in the Americas. The historic attack on New York (now Fort Constitution) helped supply the cannon and ammunition  for the British that was needed for the Battle of Bunker Hill that took place north of Boston a few months later. New Hampshire would raise three regiments for the Continental Army, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd New Hampshire regiments. New Hampshire Militia units would be called up to fight at the Battle of Bunker Hill, Battle of Bonnington, Saratoga Campaign and the Battle of Rhode Island. John Paul Jones' ship the Sloop-of-war USS Ranger and the frigate USS Raleigh were built in Portsmouth, along with other naval ships for the Continental Navy and privateers to hunt down British merchant shipping. On January 5, 1776, the Provincial Congress of New Hampshire, meeting in Exeter, ratified the first state constitution in the soon-to-be United States, six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Abolitionists from Dartmouth College founded the experimental, interracial Noyes Academy in Canaan in 1835.  Rural opponents of the school eventually dragged the school away with oxen before lighting in ablaze to protest integrated education, within months of the school's founding. Abolitionist sentiment was a strong undercurrent in the state, with significant support given the Free Soil party of John P. Hale. However the conservative Jacksonian Democrats usually maintained control, under the leadership of editor Isaac Hill. In 1856 the new Republican Party headed by Amos Tuck produced a political revolution. The post-World War II decades have seen New Hampshire increase its economic and cultural links with the greater Boston region. This reflects a national trend, in which improved highway networks have helped metropolitan areas expand into formerly rural areas or small nearby cities. The replacement of the Nashua textile mill with defense electronics contractor Sanders Associates in 1952 and the arrival of minicomputer giant Digital Equipment Corporation in the early 1970s helped lead the way toward southern New Hampshire's role as a high-tech adjunct of the Route 128 corridor. The postwar years saw the rise of New Hampshire's political primary for President of the United States, which as the first primary in the quadrennial campaign season draws enormous attention.","Smore empowers educators to connect with their community, streamline school communications, and increase engagement.",It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try search?,"Hampshire ( /ˈhæmpʃɪər/ or  /ˈhæmpʃər/; abbreviated Hants) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom outside the metropolitan counties such as the West Midlands. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. The ceremonial county is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. Hampshire is the largest county in South East England and the third largest shire county in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county during the Local Government Act 1972 boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1889, Hampshire was the fifth largest county in England. It now has an overall area of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400 sq mi),[1] and measures approximately 86 kilometres (53 mi) east–west and 76 kilometres (47 mi) north–south.[2] Hampshire's tourist attractions include many seaside resorts, the motor museum at Beaulieu, with national parks in both New Forest and the South Downs (covering some 45% of the county). Hampshire has a long maritime history and two of England's largest ports, Portsmouth and Southampton, lie on its coast. The county is famed as home of such writers as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, as well as the birthplace of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Hampshire takes its name from the settlement that is now the city of Southampton. An Old English name for Southampton was Hantum, and references to the county - Southampton and shire - became Hantum plus Scir. This is where the abbreviation Hants originates from. The county was known by the Anglo-Saxons as Hamtunschire and was recorded in the Domesday book as Hantescire.[3]  From 1889 until 1959, the administrative county was named the County of Southampton.[4][5] The chalk downland of the South Downs and southern edges of Salisbury Plain were settled in the neolithic, and these settlers built hill forts such as Winklebury and may have farmed the valleys of Hampshire. Hampshire was part of an area named Gwent or Y Went by the Celts, which also covered areas of Somerset and Wiltshire. In the Roman invasion of Britain, Hampshire was one of the first areas to fall to the invading forces. The southern portion of the county known as the Meon and in particular the valley of the River Hamble was occupied by Jutish tribes from perhaps as early as 495. Later West Saxon migrants absorbed the Jutish tribes within Wessex after 530. Some scholars believe there is evidence to show the traditional county boundaries of Hampshire may date back to the years of the original West Saxon settlement in circa 519. It is likely that both Winchester and Silchester would have fallen to the West Saxons between the years 508 and 514. A later thrust up the Hampshire Avon towards Old Sarum in 519 appears to have been checked by the Britons at Charford. The historian Albany Major in Early Wars of Wessex makes the case that the borders of the traditional county of Hampshire probably match those of the first West Saxon kingdom established by Cerdic and his son. Evidence of this comes from the border between Hampshire and Berkshire which follows generally the line of the Roman road that ran east and west through Silchester, but it is deflected in the north in a rough semicircle in such a way as to include the whole of the district around the town. He argues that the capture of Silchester, of which no record has been passed down to us, was not the work of Mercian Angles but of the West Saxons probably striking north from Winchester and possibly acting in concert with a separate force making its way up the Thames Valley towards Reading. Silchester was left desolate after its fall and it is most improbable that any regard would have been paid to its side of the border had the fixing of the county boundary been made at a later period.[6] Study of the borders between Hampshire and Wiltshire also seem to suggest the West Saxons' westward advance was checked by about AD 519. This would corroborate the date given in the Annales Cambriae for the crucial British victory at the Battle of Mons Badonicus in AD 517 which is believed to have stopped further Anglo-Saxon encroachments in south-west and midland Britain for at least a generation. Hampshire was one of the first Saxon shires, recorded in 755 as Hamtunscir,[7] but for two centuries represented the western end of Saxon England, as advances into Dorset and Somerset were fought off by the Britons. The name is derived from the port of Southampton which was known previously as simply ""Hampton"". After the Saxons advanced further west Hampshire became the centre of the Kingdom of Wessex, and many Saxon kings are buried at Winchester. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful King Alfred, who stabilised the region in the 9th century. After the Norman Conquest the county was favoured by Norman kings who established the New Forest as a hunting forest. The county was recorded in the Domesday Book divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. Over several centuries a series of castles and forts were constructed along the coast of the Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Roman Portchester Castle which overlooks Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by Henry VIII including Hurst Castle, situated on a sand spit at the mouth of the Solent, Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as Poole and Bristol declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the Mayflower and the Titanic, the latter being staffed largely by natives of Southampton. Hampshire played a crucial role in the Second World War due to the large Royal Navy harbour at Portsmouth, the army camp at Aldershot and the military Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on Salisbury Plain and the Isle of Purbeck. Supermarine, the designers of the Spitfire and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the British Army's main permanent camps. Farnborough is a major centre for the Aviation industry. Although the Isle of Wight was traditionally part of Hampshire, it has been administratively independent for over a century, obtaining a county council of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full ceremonial county in 1974. Apart from a shared police force there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, though many organisations still combine Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch also fall within the traditional county of Hampshire, but were transferred to Dorset in the local government reorganisation of 1974.  The boundary was changed again in 1992, when South Tidworth was transferred to Wiltshire. Hampshire was the departure point of some of those later to settle on the east coast of what is now the United States, in the 17th century, giving its name in particular to the state of New Hampshire. The counties of Isle of Wight and Southampton in Virginia reflect the origins of some of the earliest Jamestown settlers.[8] With the exceptions of the unitary authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton, Hampshire is governed by Hampshire County Council based in Winchester, with several non-metropolitan districts beneath it, and for the majority of the county, parish councils or town councils at the local level. The districts of Hampshire are the following: The county also contains two national parks; the first covering the New Forest, and therefore governance of this area is carried out by a national park authority as well as the New Forest District Council, the second the newer national park for the South Downs which covers the chalk downlands from Winchester eastwards which embraces a large number of local authority areas across three counties, Hampshire, West and East Sussex. Hampshire is a relatively affluent county, with a Gross domestic product (GDP) of £32.3 billion in 2005 (£22.4 billion when excluding Southampton and Portsmouth).[9] In 2006, Hampshire had a GDP per capita of £19,300, comparable with the UK as a whole and slightly below the South East England figure of £19,600.[10] Portsmouth and Winchester have the highest job densities in the county, and therefore there is a high level of commuting into the cities. Southampton has the highest number of total jobs and commuting both into and out of the city is high. The county has a lower level of unemployment than the national average, at 1.9% when the national rate was 3.3%, and as of March 2005 has fallen to 1.1%. 39% are employed by large firms, compared with a national average of 42%. Hampshire has a considerably higher than national average employment in high-tech industries, but average levels in knowledge-based industry. 25.21% of the population work in the public sector.[11] Many rural areas of Hampshire have traditionally been reliant on agriculture, though the county was less agricultural than most surrounding counties, and was mostly concentrated on dairy farming. The significance of agriculture as an employer and wealth creator has declined since the first half of the 20th century and agriculture currently employs 1.32% of the population. The New Forest area is a National Park, and tourism is a significant economic segment in this area, with 7.5 million visitors in 1992.[12] The South Downs and the cities of Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchester also attract tourists to the county. Southampton Boat Show is one of the biggest annual events held in the county, and attracts visitors from throughout the country. In 2003 the county had a total of 31 million day visits, and 4.2 million longer stays.[13] The cities of Southampton and Portsmouth are both significant ports, with Southampton handling a large proportion of the national container freight and Portsmouth housing a large Royal Navy base. The docks have traditionally been large employers in these cities, though again mechanisation has forced diversification of the economy. At the Census 2001[14] the ceremonial county recorded a population of 1,644,249, of which 1,240,103 were in the administrative county, 217,445 were in the unitary authority of Southampton, and 186,701 were in Portsmouth. The population of the administrative county grew 5.6% from the 1991 census, Southampton grew 6.2% while Portsmouth remained unchanged, compared with 2.6% for England and Wales as a whole. Eastleigh and Winchester grew fastest at 9% each. The age structure of the population is similar to the national average. 96.73% of residents were white British, falling to 92.37% in Southampton. The significant ethnic minorities are Asian at 1.34% and mixed race at 0.84%. 0.75% of residents were migrants from outside the UK. 73.86% stated their religion as Christianity and 16.86% were not religious. Significant minority religions were Islam (0.76%) and Hinduism (0.33%). The county has a high level of car ownership, with only 15.7% having no access to a private car compared with 26.8% for England and Wales. The county has a lower than average use of trains (3.2% compared with 4.1% for commuting) and buses (3.2% to 7.4%) but a higher than average use of bicycles (3.5% to 2.7%) and cars (63.5% to 55.3%).[15] The school system in Hampshire (including Southampton and Portsmouth) is comprehensive. Geographically inside the Hampshire LEA are twenty four independent schools, Southampton has three and Portsmouth has four. Few Hampshire schools have sixth forms, which varies by district council. There are 14 further education colleges within the Hampshire LEA, including 5 graded as 'outstanding' by Ofsted: Alton College, Farnborough Sixth Form College, Peter Symonds College, Queen Mary's College, and South Downs College There are four universities, namely the University of Southampton, Southampton Solent University, the University of Portsmouth and the University of Winchester (which also had a small campus in Basingstoke until 2011). Hampshire is divided into eighteen parliamentary constituencies. Fourteen of these are represented by Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs), two by the Liberal Democrats and two by Labour. Labour represents the largest urban centre, holding both Southampton constituencies (Test and Itchen). The Liberal Democrats hold Portsmouth South and Eastleigh. The Conservatives represent a mix of rural and urban areas: Aldershot, Basingstoke, East Hampshire, Fareham, Gosport, Havant, Meon Valley, North East Hampshire, North West Hampshire, New Forest East, New Forest West, Portsmouth North, Romsey and Southampton North and Winchester. At the 2009 local elections for Hampshire County Council, the Conservative Party had a 47.72% share of the votes, the Liberal Democrats had 32.89% and Labour 7.07%. As a result, 51 Conservatives, 25 Liberal Democrats, one Labour and one Community Campaign councillor sit on the County Council.[16] Southampton City Council, which is entirely independent, has 26 Conservative, 14 Labour and 8 Liberal Democrat councillors.[17] Portsmouth City Council, also independent, has 23 Liberal Democrat, 17 Conservative and two Labour councillors.[18] Hampshire also has its own County Youth Council (HCYC)[19] and is an independent youth-run organisation. It meets once a month around Hampshire and aims to give the young people of Hampshire a voice. It also has numerous district and borough youth councils including Basingstoke's ""Basingstoke & Deane Youth Council"".[20] Along with the Youth council for the Test Valley District, youthExpress. Hampshire has wildlife typical of the island of Great Britain. The River Test has a growing number of otters, although other areas of the county have quite low numbers. There are reports of Wild Boar across the county. The New Forest is known for its ponies, which have free rein over much of the area. One distinguishing feature is that Hampshire has a large free roaming herd of Red Deer, including more than 6,500 stags during busy seasons. The stag population is protected by the government and hunting is prohibited. Hampshire's geology falls into two categories. In the south, along the coast is the ""Hampshire Basin"", an area of relatively non-resistant Eocene and Oligocene clays and gravels which are protected from sea erosion by the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight. These low, flat lands support heathland and woodland habitats, a large area of which forms part of the New Forest. The New Forest has a mosaic of heathland, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland habitats that host diverse wildlife. The forest is protected as a national park, limiting development and agricultural use to protect the landscape and wildlife. Large areas of the New Forest are open common lands kept as a grassland plagioclimax by grazing animals, including domesticated cattle, pigs and horses, and several wild deer species. Erosion of the weak rock and sea level change flooding the low land has carved several large estuaries and rias, notably the 16 km (9.9 mi) long[21] Southampton Water and the large convoluted Portsmouth Harbour. The Isle of Wight lies off the coast of Hampshire where the non-resistant rock has been eroded away, forming the Solent. In the north and centre of the county the substrate is the rocks of the Chalk Group, which form Salisbury Plain and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Thames valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is Pilot Hill, which reaches a height of 286 m (938 ft), and lies on the border with West Berkshire. Butser Hill near Petersfield is the second highest point at 271 metres (889 ft) and lies in the South Downs National Park. The highest village in Hampshire is Bentworth, near Alton. The downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects. A large area of the downs is now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Itchen and Test are trout rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. Nestled in a valley on the downs is Selborne, and the countryside surrounding the village was the location of Gilbert White's pioneering observations on natural history. Hampshire's county flower is the Dog Rose.[22] Hampshire has a milder climate than most areas of the British Isles,[23] being in the far south with the climate stabilising effect of the sea, but protected against the more extreme weather of the Atlantic coast. Hampshire has a higher average annual temperature than the UK average at 9.8 to 12 °C (50 to 54 °F),[24] average rainfall at 741–1060 millimetres (29.2–42 in) per year,[25] and higher than average sunshine at over 1541 hours per year.[26] Hampshire's county town is Winchester, a historic city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Wessex and of England until the Norman conquest of England. The port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth were split off as independent unitary authorities in 1997, although they are still included in Hampshire for ceremonial purposes. Fareham, Gosport and Havant have grown into a conurbation that stretches along the coast between the two main cities. The three cities are all university cities, Southampton being home to the University of Southampton and Southampton Solent University (formerly Southampton Institute), Portsmouth to the University of Portsmouth, and Winchester to the University of Winchester (formerly known as University College Winchester; King Alfred's College).The northeast of the county houses the Blackwater Valley conurbation, which includes the towns of Farnborough, Aldershot, Blackwater and Yateley and borders both Berkshire and Surrey. Hampshire lies outside the green belt area of restricted development around London, but has good railway and motorway links to the capital, and in common with the rest of the south-east has seen the growth of dormitory towns since the 1960s. Basingstoke, in the northern part of the county, has grown from a country town into a business and financial centre. Aldershot, Portsmouth, and Farnborough have strong military associations with the Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force respectively. The county also includes several market towns: Alton, Andover, Bishop's Waltham, Lymington, New Milton, Petersfield, Ringwood, Romsey and Whitchurch. For the complete list of settlements see List of places in Hampshire. Due to Hampshire's long association with pigs and boars, natives of the county have been known as Hampshire hogs since the 18th century.[27] Hampshire has literary connections, being the birthplace of authors including Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, and the residence of others, such as Charles Kingsley. Austen lived most of her life in Hampshire, where her father was rector of Steventon, Hampshire, and wrote all of her novels in the county. Hampshire also has many visual art connections, claiming the painter John Everett Millais as a native, and the cities and countryside have been the subject of paintings by L. S. Lowry and J. M. W. Turner. Selborne houses the Oates museum for the explorer Lawrence Oates, and entertainers Peter Sellers, Benny Hill, Carl Barat and Craig David. Hampshire is the home of many orchestras, bands and groups. Musician Laura Marling hails originally from Hampshire. The Hampshire County Youth Choir is based in Winchester, and has had successful tours of Canada and Italy in recent years. The Hampshire County Youth Orchestra (with its associated chamber orchestra and string orchestra) is based at Thornden Hall. The game of cricket was largely developed in south-east England, with one of the first teams forming at Hambledon in 1750, with the Hambledon Club creating many of cricket's early rules. Hampshire County Cricket Club today is a successful first-class team, captained by Dimitri Mascarenhas. The main county ground is the Rose Bowl in West End, which has hosted several one day internationals and which, following redevelopment, hosted its first test match in 2011. Notable players include current England batsman Kevin Pietersen. Hampshire have also been captained by former Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne. Hampshire's relatively safe waters have allowed the county to develop as one of the busiest sailing areas in the country, with many yacht clubs and several manufacturers on the Solent. The sport of windsurfing was invented at Hayling Island, which is to the south east of the county.[28] Hampshire has several association football teams, including Premier League side Southampton F.C., and League One side Portsmouth F.C. and Football League Two side Aldershot Town F.C.. Portsmouth F.C. and Southampton F.C. have traditionally been fierce rivals. Portsmouth won the FA Cup in 1939 and 2008 and Football League title twice, in 1949 and 1950, but have spent much of the last 50 years outside the top division and at one stage spent two seasons in the Fourth Division (the lowest division in senior football). Southampton, meanwhile, won the FA Cup in 1976, reached the final in 2003 and spent 27 unbroken years in England's top division between 1978 and 2005. Aldershot F.C. became members of the Football League in 1932 but never progressed beyond the Third Division, and on 25 March 1992 went into liquidation and were forced to resign from the league. A new football club, Aldershot Town F.C. was formed almost immediately, and started life in Division 3 of the Isthmian League. In 2008 Aldershot Town were crowned the Conference National champions and were promoted into the Football League. Hampshire also has a number of Non League football teams. Basingstoke Town, Eastleigh, Farnborough and Havant & Waterlooville play in the Conference South. Bashley Gosport and AFC Totton play in the Southern Football League Premier Division and Sholing F.C. and Winchester City F.C. play in the Southern Football League Division One South and West. Thruxton Circuit is Hampshire's premier motor racing course with the National Motor Museum being located in the New Forest adjacent to Beaulieu Palace House.

The Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students  (AFES) is an evangelical Christian parachurch organisation that aims to encourage university students to believe in and follow Jesus Christ. It is affiliated with, and in 1947 was a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. The young English evangelist, Howard Guinness, toured Australia in 1930 to encourage university students in evangelism. He helped form campus student groups starting in Sydney, then Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart, including Sydney University Evangelical Union (SUEU) and Melbourne University Christian Union (MUCU - originally the Melbourne University Evangelical Union), which celebrated their 75th anniversaries in 2005. Guinness returned in 1933-1934 and founded groups in Perth and Adelaide. These groups, led by the SUEU and the MUCU, joined together to form a network in 1936 as the Australian Intervarsity Fellowship or IVF, which later changed its name to the AFES in 1973. It had over 2000 members by 1959 and today has groups in over 50 campuses across the country in every state and territory, and employs over 100 staffworkers who look after the students on their various campuses.

what is the function of the cerebral association areas,"The association areas are the parts of the cerebral cortex that do not belong to the primary regions. They function to produce a meaningful perceptual experience of the world, enable us to interact effectively, and support abstract thinking and language. The parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes-all located in the posterior part of the cortex-integrate sensory information and information stored in memory. The frontal lobe or prefrontal association complex is involved in planning actions and movement, as well as abstract thought. Globally, the association areas are organized as distributed networks. Each network connects areas distributed across widely spaced regions of the cortex. Distinct networks are positioned adjacent to one another yielding a complex series of interwoven networks. The specific organization of the association networks is debated with evidence for interactions, hierarchical relationships, and competition between networks. In humans, association networks are particularly important to language function. In the past it was theorized that language abilities are localized in the left hemisphere in areas 44 / 45, the Broca's area, for language expression and area 22, the Wernicke's area, for language reception. However, language is no longer limited to easily identifiable areas. More recent research suggests that the processes of language expression and reception occur in areas other than just those structures around the lateral sulcus, including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and pons.","The cerebral cortex is joined to various subcortical structures such as the thalamus the basal ganglia, sending information to hem along efferent connections and receiving information from them via afferent connections. Most sensory information is mapped to the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. Olfactory information, nevertheless, passes through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex also called the piriform cortex. The bulk of connections is from one area of the cortex to another, rather than from subcortical areas. Extracortilal afferents supply primary sensor area at the cortical levels, where the input fibers terminate, up to 20% of the synapses but that in other areas and other layers the percentage is likely to be much lower. Just underneath the verbal correct are interconnected subcortical masses of gray matter called basal ganglia ( or nuclei). The Basal ganglia receive input from the substantial nigra of the midbrain and motor areas of the cerebral cortex and transmit signals back to both of these locations. They are involved in motor control. They are found lateral to the thalamus. The components of the basal ganglia are the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus, the nucleus accumbens and, the putamen, The putamen and globus pallidus are also collectively known as the lentiform nucleus since they both form a lens-shaped body. The putamen and caudate nucleus are also collectively called the corpus striatum after their striped appearance.",,,,,,,,,
what is the cross made of on hot cross buns,"The traditional method for making the cross on top of the bun is to use shortcrust pastry; however, more recently recipes have recommended a paste consisting of flour and water.","Soft and with a touch of spices and packed with dried fruit, hot cross buns are usually a Good Friday treat. Skip the cross marked on top and enjoy these buns year round Every year, as Easter approaches my mind start thinking about different Eater bread recipes. Last year I’ve shared with you a recipe for Romanian Easter bread (Pasca) , Italian Easter bread (Pane di Pasqua) and Greek Eater bread (Tsoureki). Well, today we’re visiting the Great Britain to enjoy a cup of tea with their well know Easter bread – Hot Cross Buns. If you have never made a hot cross buns, prepare yourself to have your kitchen filled with an irresistible aroma of fresh-baked bread, spices and sweetness. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom added to the dough give these buns a nice spicy touch, while the sugar and the dried fruit bring sweetness. I’ve read a few stories where the name actually comes from and it seems the most popular story is related to the Anglo-Saxons. The story says they were making the buns in honor of their goddess of light, Eostre, whose day was celebrating in Spring. Other stories include a few superstitions. Hot cross buns baked and served on Good Friday do not spoil or mold during the year. Keeping a bun in your kitchen until next year to ensure all breads will rise and bake perfectly. Other stories advice to keep a bun for medical purposes. Some say, if a piece of the bun is gives to a sick person, they will immediately recover. There are so many stories, I have no idea which one is actually the real one, but it’s sure is fun reading about them. What’s better than reading, is actually making hot cross buns and enjoying them with a cup of tea. Some recipes for hot cross buns suggest marking the cross before baking and filling it with a paste made from flour, water and shortening. Other recipes have the cross marked but filled right after they are baked with a sweet sugary filling. I prefer mine to be marked after they are baked and cooled. You have to keep in mind when making the cross that the buns must be completely cooled. No warmth or the icing will melt. Optional, if you prefer a darker color for your buns, you can brush them with egg wash (egg yolk mixed with few drops of water) before baking or if you prefer a sweet and shiny top, you can brush the buns with a sugar syrup as soon as you take them out of the oven. My preference is to leave the buns plain. I do not brush them either with egg wash or sugar. The sugar added to the dough brings enough sweetness to the dough to give them a nice brownish color once baked.

what is the meaning of quadrant in math,"The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called quadrants, each bounded by two half-axes.","Our reference angle calculator is a handy tool for recalculating angles into their acute version. All you have to do is simply input any positive angle into the field, and this calculator will find the reference angle for you. This article explains what a reference angle is, providing a reference angle definition. It will also provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to find a reference angle in radians and degrees, along with a few examples. Keep scrolling, and you'll find a graph with quadrants as well! Look at the picture above. Every angle is measured from the positive part of the x-axis to its terminal line (the line that determines the end of the angle) traveling counterclockwise. If you want to find the reference angle, you have to find the smallest possible angle formed by the x-axis and the terminal line, going either clockwise or counterclockwise. Reference angles are useful in trigonometry. If you want to find the sine or cosine of any arbitrary angle, you first have to look for its reference angle in the first quarter. Then you can find the trigonometric function of the reference angle and choose a proper sign. The two axes of a 2D Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions called quadrants. Numbering starts from the upper right quadrant, where both coordinates are positive, and goes in an anti-clockwise direction, as in the picture. Generally, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent) give the same value for both an angle and its reference angle. The only thing that changes is the sign — these functions are positive and negative in various quadrants. Follow the ""All Students Take Calculus"" mnemonic rule (ASTC) to remember when these functions are positive. Make sure to take a look at our law of cosines calculator and our law of sines calculator for more information about trigonometry. Choose your initial angle — for example, 610°. If your angle is larger than 360° (a full angle), subtract 360°. Keep doing it until you get an angle smaller than a full angle. This is the same as finding the modulo. In this example, after subtracting 360°, we get 250°. In this case, 250° lies in the third quadrant. In this case, we need to choose the formula reference angle = angle - 180°. reference angle = 250° - 180° = 70°. If you need a tool to help convert between different units of angle measurements, try out our angle conversion. Yes, each angle has a reference angle. For angles in the first quadrant, i.e., angles less than or equal to 90 degrees, the reference angle is equal to the original angle. The reference angle for 2π is 0. This is because 2π is the same as 0 radians in terms of reference angle, which is in the first quadrant. As such, the references angle is equal to the angle, and is therefore 0. The reference angle for 4π/3 is π/3. 4π/3 is equivalent to 240°, which is in the third quadrant of a circle. As such, the reference angle is equal to the angle minus π, which in this case is π/3.",,,,,,,,,
where did the st louis cardinals play before busch stadium,"Busch Stadium is the Cardinals' fourth home ballpark and the third to bear that name. The Cardinals' original home ballpark was Sportsman's Park from 1882 to 1892 when they played in the American Association and were known as the Browns. In 1893, the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920. The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field. Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns. In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season. The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium, or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005. It was built as the multi-purpose stadium home of both the baseball Cardinals and the NFL football Cardinals, who are now the Arizona Cardinals. The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium.","The web server is not returning a connection.

The grand opening took place on May 29, 1881 with the St. Louis Brown Stockings playing an exhibition game against the Cincinnati Red Stockings. In 1882 the team played for the first time as a professional club, marking the beginning of the professional franchise that would eventually join the National League in 1892 and be renamed the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900. The Browns, who won't be known as the Cardinals until 1900, make their National League debut on Apr. 12 with a 14-10 loss at home to the Chicago Colts, later to be renamed the Cubs. On Apr. 17, the Browns fall to the Reds, 5-1, in the first National League game played on a Sunday. St. Louis opens play in its new park located at Natural Bridge and Vandeventer and open the season with a 10-1 victory over Cleveland. After Anheuser-Busch, Inc. bought, the Cardinals in 1953, Sportsman's Park was renamed Busch Stadium. The Cardinals closed the stadium on May 8, 1966 with a 10-5 loss to the San Francisco Giants. Served as home to the Cardinals from 1966 to 2005. On May 12, 1966, the Cardinals opened new Busch Memorial Stadium in downtown St. Louis by defeating the Atlanta Braves, 4-3, in 12 innings. Busch Stadium II served as host for the 1966 MLB All-Star Game, as well as six World Series (1967, '68, '82, '85, '87, 2004). The Cardinals closed Busch Stadium in 2005, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7-5 on October 2, 2005. On April 10, 2006, the Cardinals opened their new 46,000 seat retro-style downtown ballpark with a 6-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.

who refused his best actor oscar for patton,"He was the first actor to refuse the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Patton in 1970), having warned the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences months in advance that he would do so on philosophical grounds if he won. Scott believed that every dramatic performance was unique and could not be compared to others.","George Campbell Scott (October 18, 1927 – September 22, 1999) was an American stage and film actor, director, and producer. He was best known for his stage work, as well as his portrayal of General George S. Patton in the film Patton, as General Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, and as Ebenezer Scrooge in Clive Donner's 1984 film A Christmas Carol. He was the first actor to refuse the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Patton in 1970), having warned the academy months in advance that he would do so on philosophical grounds if he won.  Scott believed that every dramatic performance was unique and could not be compared to others. George Campbell Scott was born in Wise, Virginia, the son of Helena Agnes (née Slemp; 1904–1935) and George Dewey Scott (1902–1988).[1] His mother died just before his eighth birthday, and he was raised by his father, an executive at Buick. Scott's original ambition was to be a writer like his favorite author, F. Scott Fitzgerald; while attending Redford High School in Detroit, he wrote many short stories, none of which was ever published. As an adult, he tried on many occasions to write a novel, but was never able to complete one to his satisfaction.[2] Scott joined the United States Marine Corps, serving from 1945 to 1949. He was assigned to 8th and I Barracks in Washington, DC, in which capacity he taught English literature and radio speaking/writing at the Marine Corps Institute. His primary duty, however, was as an honor guard for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. He later said his duties at Arlington led to his drinking.[3] After his military service, Scott enrolled in the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism and then became interested in drama. His first public appearance on stage was as the barrister in a university production of Terence Rattigan's The Winslow Boy, directed by H. Donovan Rhynsburger. During rehearsals for that show, he made his first stage appearance—in a student production of Noël Coward's  Hands Across the Sea, directed by Jerry V. Tobias. He graduated from the university in 1953 with degrees in English and theater.[4] Scott first rose to prominence for his work with Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. In 1958, he won an Obie Award for his performances in Children of Darkness (in which he made the first of many appearances opposite his future wife, actress Colleen Dewhurst), for As You Like It, and for playing the title character in William Shakespeare's Richard III (a performance one critic said was the ""angriest"" Richard III of all time).[5] He was on Broadway the following year, winning critical acclaim for his portrayal of the prosecutor in The Andersonville Trial by Saul Levitt. This was based on the military trial of the commandant of the infamous Civil War prison camp in Andersonville, Georgia. His performance earned him a mention in Time. In 1970, Scott directed a highly acclaimed television version of this same play. It starred William Shatner, Richard Basehart, and Jack Cassidy, who was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as the defense lawyer in this production. Scott continued to appear in and sometimes direct Broadway productions throughout the 1960s. The most commercially successful show in which he worked was Neil Simon's Plaza Suite (1968). The show was composed of three separate one-act plays all using the same set, with Scott portraying a different lead character in each act; it ran for 1,097 performances. He made many television appearances, including an episode of NBC's The Virginian, in the episode ""The Brazen Bell"", in which he recites Oscar Wilde's poem ""The Ballad Of Reading Gaol"". That same year, he appeared in NBC's medical drama The Eleventh Hour, in the episode ""I Don't Belong in a White-Painted House"". He appeared opposite Laurence Olivier and Julie Harris in Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory in a 1961 television production.[6] In 1963, Scott starred in the hour-long television drama series East Side/West Side. He portrayed a New York City social worker, along with co-stars Cicely Tyson and Elizabeth Wilson. Scott was a major creative influence on the show, resulting in conflicts with James T. Aubrey, the head of CBS. The Emmy Award-winning program had a series of prominent guest stars, including James Earl Jones. The portrayal of challenging urban issues made attracting advertisers difficult, not helped by the limited distribution.  Not all CBS network affiliates broadcast the show, and it was cancelled after one season.[7] Scott's most famous early role was in the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, in which he played General ""Buck"" Turgidson. In later interviews with Stanley Kubrick, Scott was revealed to have initially refused to camp it up on camera. As a compromise, Kubrick had Scott go over the top in rehearsal, assuring Scott that the cameras were off, which was untrue. Kubrick proceeded to use this version in the final cut, which Scott supposedly resented.[8] In 1965, he was cast, under the direction of John Huston, as Abraham with, among others, co-star Ava Gardner cast as Sarah in the Dino de Laurentiis film: The Bible: In the Beginning which was released by 20th Century Fox in 1966.[9] In 1966, Scott appeared as Jud Barker in the NBC western The Road West, starring Barry Sullivan, Kathryn Hays, Andrew Prine, and Glenn Corbett. Scott won wide public recognition in the film Anatomy of a Murder, in which he played a wily prosecutor opposite James Stewart as the defense attorney. Scott was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Scott portrayed George S. Patton in the 1970 film Patton and researched extensively for the role, studying films of the general and talking to those who knew him. Scott refused the Oscar nomination for Patton, just as he had done for his 1962 nomination for The Hustler, but won the award anyway.[10] In a letter to the Motion Picture Academy, he stated that he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors. However, regarding this second rejection of the Academy Award, Scott famously said elsewhere, ""The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it.""[3][11] Sixteen years later, in 1986, Scott reprised his role in a made-for-television sequel, The Last Days of Patton. The movie was based on Patton's final weeks after being mortally injured in a car accident, with flashbacks of Patton's life. At the time the sequel was aired, Scott mentioned in a TV Guide interview that he told the academy to donate his Oscar to the Patton Museum, but since the instructions were never put in writing, it was never delivered.  (The Best Picture Oscar for Patton was given to the George C. Marshall Foundation Library at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, the same institution that generations of Pattons attended, by producer Frank McCarthy a few weeks after the awards ceremony, and is on display there.) Scott did not turn down the New York Film Critics Award (of which his then wife Colleen Dewhurst said, ""George thinks this is the only film award worth having""[12]). He continued to do stage work throughout the rest of his career, receiving Tony Award nominations for his performance as Astrov in a revival of Uncle Vanya (1973), his Willy Loman in a revival of Death of a Salesman (1975), and his performance as Henry Drummond in a revival of Inherit the Wind (1996). In the latter play, he had to miss an unusually large number of performances due to illness, with his role being taken over by National Actors Theatre artistic director Tony Randall.[13] In 1996, he received an honorary Drama Desk Award for a lifetime devotion to theatre. Scott also starred in well-received productions of Larry Gelbart's Sly Fox (1976) (based on Ben Jonson's Volpone), which ran 495 performances, and a revival of Noël Coward's Present Laughter (1982). He frequently directed on Broadway, as well, including productions of All God's Chillun Got Wings (1975) and Design for Living (1985), as well as being an actor and director (Death of a Salesman, Present Laughter and On Borrowed Time). In 1971, Scott gave two more critically acclaimed performances, as a de facto Sherlock Holmes in They Might Be Giants and as an alcoholic doctor in the black comedy The Hospital. Despite his repeated snubbing of the academy, Scott was again nominated for Best Actor for the latter role. Scott excelled on television that year, as well, appearing in an adaptation of Arthur Miller's The Price, an installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology. He was nominated for, and won, an Emmy Award for his role, which he accepted. Scott also starred in the popular 1980 horror film The Changeling, with Melvyn Douglas. He received the Canadian Genie Award for Best Foreign Film Actor for his performance.[14] In 1981, Scott appeared alongside Timothy Hutton and rising stars Sean Penn and Tom Cruise in the coming-of-age film Taps. In 1982, he was cast as Fagin in the CBS made-for-TV adaptation of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. In 1984, he portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in a television adaptation of A Christmas Carol. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the role. I think I learned to act from people like James Cagney and Paul Muni. And I'm sure I learned more from Bette Davis than anyone. She has enormous presence, a sense of surprise. She sets you up like a great boxer and BAM! she gives you something else. She does have a certain consistent style, but when you examine her work you find enormous variety of color and intelligence. In 1989, Scott starred in the television movie The Ryan White Story, as Charles Vaughan, the lawyer defending Ryan White from discrimination. In 1990, he voiced Smoke, the villain in the television special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue, and he also voiced the villainous Percival McLeach in Disney's The Rescuers Down Under that same year. He was featured in The Exorcist III the same year. In 1997, Scott portrayed Juror #3 in the TV-movie 12 Angry Men, for which he would win another Emmy Award. He hosted the TV series Weapons At War on A&E TV, but was replaced after one season by Gerald McRaney. Weapons At War moved to The History Channel with Scott still credited as host for the first season. Scott was replaced by Robert Conrad after his death in 1999. In 1999, he made his last film, the TV movie Inherit the Wind, portraying Matthew Harrison Brady (ironically opposite the role he had played on stage) with Jack Lemmon as Henry Drummond, with whom he had also worked in 12 Angry Men. Scott had a reputation for being moody and mercurial while on the set. ""There is no question you get pumped up by the recognition,"" he once said, ""Then a self-loathing sets in when you realize you're enjoying it.""[15] A famous anecdote relates that one of his stage costars, Maureen Stapleton, told the director of Neil Simon's Plaza Suite, ""I don't know what to do — I'm scared of him."" The director, Mike Nichols, replied, ""My dear, everyone is scared of George C. Scott.""[16] He had a daughter, Michelle (born August 21, 1954) with Karen Truesdell. He was an atheist.[17] In 1982, Scott appeared in a campaign commercial for Republican U.S. Senator Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut.[18] Like Weicker, Scott was at that time a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. Scott suffered a series of heart attacks in the 1980s.[19] He died on September 22, 1999, aged 71, of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was buried in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California, in an unmarked grave.",,,,,,,,,

who stood in front of the tank in tiananmen square,"More than 29 years after the incident, there is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown. At least one witness has stated that ""Tank Man"" was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest. Shao Jiang, who was a student leader, said: ""I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks."" Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and recorded on video.","Coordinates: 39°54′23.5″N 116°23′59.8″E﻿ / ﻿39.906528°N 116.399944°E﻿ / 39.906528; 116.399944 Tank Man (also known as the Unknown Protester or Unknown Rebel) is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the Chinese military had suppressed the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him.  The incident was filmed and seen worldwide. More than 25 years after the incident, there is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown.[4]  There is at least one witness who has stated that 'Tank Man' was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest.  Shao Jiang was a student leader and he said, ""I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks.""[5]  Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and videoed, with those images reaching the rest of the world. The incident took place at the north edge of Tiananmen Square, along Chang'an Avenue, on June 5, 1989, one day after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests.[6] The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags.[7] As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action.[8] After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse. Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on.  At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leaped in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff. Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.[8] Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, said it was the Chinese government PSB (Public Security Bureau),[9] while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, Time included the ""Unknown Rebel"" in a feature titled ""Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century"".[10] Little is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid the Sunday Express named him as Wang Weilin (王维林), a 19-year-old student[11] who was later charged with ""political hooliganism"" and ""attempting to subvert members of the People's Liberation Army.""[12] However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights.[13] One party member was quoted as saying, ""We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison.""[13] Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man's identity and current whereabouts.[14] There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, reported that he was executed 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.[8] In Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have ""no idea who he was either"" and that he's still alive somewhere on the mainland. The government of the People's Republic of China has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), ""I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,"" and then replied in English, ""I think never killed""  [sic].[15] The government also said the actions of the man not coming to harm showed the humility of the country's military.[16] In a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Jiang Zemin said, ""He was never arrested."" He then stated, ""I don't know where he is now."" He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.[17] Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989[13][18] and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of the 20th century.[1][2][3] A PBS interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.[19] Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China.[13] When undergraduate students at Beijing University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they ""were genuinely mystified.""[20] One of the students said that the image was ""artwork."" It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man that he whispered to the student next to him ""89,"" which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event. It has been suggested that the ""Unknown Rebel,"" if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.[13] At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.[21] Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.[22] On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.[18] The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both Time and Life magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.[22] The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about half a mile (800 meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter.[23] With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk)  hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.[24] Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world[22] and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.[24] He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but didn't win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century. Charlie Cole, working for Newsweek and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to Newsweek.[22] Franklin won a World Press Award for a similar photo.[25]  It was featured in Life's ""100 Photographs That Changed the World"" in 2003. On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter Terril Jones revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.[26] Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,[27] but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.[22] It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Wah's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A ""foreign"" photographer accompanying him suddenly said, ""I am not gonna die for your country,"" and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.[27] In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the world. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua, CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer and NBC cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene.[28][29][30] ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony.[31] After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the ""tank man"" incident occurred.[21][32] In Tom Clancy's 2000 novel The Bear and the Dragon, the Chinese authorities apprehend and execute Tank Man, then bill the surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head. A fictionalized version of the fate of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in Lucy Kirkwood's 2013 play Chimerica.[33] A similar scene is depicted in the music video for Club Foot by the English rock band Kasabian.[34] On 4 June 2013, Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are ""today"", ""tonight"", ""June 4"", and ""big yellow duck"". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a photoshopped version of Tank Man, in which rubber ducks replaced the tanks, had been circulating around Twitter[35] — a reference to Florentijn Hofman's Rubber Duck sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour.[36]",,,,,,,,,

Quantities can be compared in terms of ""more"", ""less"", or ""equal"", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.","Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude.

The work was extended to growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Frances, Wilson Smith and Macfarlane Burnet, leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines. In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War. Greater advances were made in vaccinology and immunology, and vaccines became safer and mass-produced. Today, thanks to the advances of molecular technology, we are on the verge of making influenza vaccines through the genetic manipulation of influenza genes (see figure 1). Figure 1. Avian flu vaccine development by Reverse Genetics technique. Flu vaccine is usually grown in fertilized chicken eggs (see figure 2). In February preceding each fall's flu season (in the Northern hemisphere), three strains of flu are selected and chicken eggs inoculated. As of November 2007, both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs. The European Union has also approved Optaflu, a vaccine produced by Novartis using vats of animal cells. This technique is expected to be more scalable and avoid problems with eggs, such as allergic reactions and incompatibility with strains that affect avians like chickens. A DNA-based vaccination, which is hoped to be even faster to manufacture, is currently in clinical trials, but has not yet been proven safe and effective. Research continues into the idea of a ""universal"" influenza vaccine (but no vaccine candidates have been announced) which would not need to be tailored to work on particular strains, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses. Figure 2. Researchers infect eggs and sort through eggs used for the cultivation of flu vaccine. Vaccines are made the same way they've been made for half a century, relying on tens of millions of chicken eggs to grow the virus. In a 2007 report, the current global capacity of approximately 826 million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the current production of 413 million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8 billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly 2 billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than 3 billion courses would be required to serve these populations. Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population. An effective method of vaccine generation that bypasses the need for eggs is the construction of ""influenza virus-like particle (VLP)"". VLP is a non-egg, non-mammalian cell culture-based vaccine, purified from the supernatants of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells following infection of baculovirus vectors encoding an expression cassette made up of only three influenza virus structural proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix (M1) VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay. Each year, three strains are chosen for selection in that year's flu vaccination by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. The chosen strains are the H1N1, H3N2, and Type-B strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season. Due to the high mutation rate of the virus a particular vaccine formulation is effective for at most about a year. The World Health Organization coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. ""The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network was established in 1952. The network comprises 4 WHO Collaborating Centres (WHO CCs) and 112 institutions in 83 countries, which are recognized by WHO as WHO National Influenza Centres (NICs). These NICs collect specimens in their country, perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization. They ship newly isolated strains to WHO CCs for high level antigenic and genetic analysis, the result of which forms the basis for WHO recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere each year."" The Global Influenza Surveillance Network's selection of viruses for the vaccine manufacturing process is based on its best estimate of which strains will be predominant the next year, amounting in the end to well-informed but fallible guesswork.

In children fever occurs in between 5 and 10%, as may muscle pains or feeling tired. In certain years, the vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome in older people in about one per million doses. It should not be given to those with severe allergies to eggs or to previous versions of the vaccine. The vaccines come in both inactive and weakened viral forms. The inactive version should be used for those who are pregnant. They come in forms that are injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin.[2] Vaccination against influenza began in the 1930s with large scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945.[9][10] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications recommended for a basic health system.[11] The wholesale price in the developing world is about 5.25 USD per dose as of 2014.[12] In the United States it costs less than 25 USD.[13] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the flu vaccine is the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The flu vaccine can also reduce the severity of the flu if a person contracts a strain of the flu that the vaccine did not contain.[14] It takes about two weeks following vaccination for antibodies to protect against the flu.[15] A 2012 meta-analysis found that flu shots were efficacious 67 percent of the time; the populations that benefited the most were HIV-positive adults ages 18 to 55 (76 percent), healthy adults ages 18 to 46 (approximately 70 percent), and healthy children ages 6 to 24 months (66 percent).[16] A vaccine is assessed by its efficacy; the extent to which it reduces risk of disease under controlled conditions, and its effectiveness, the observed reduction in risk after the vaccine is put into use.[17] In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza.[4] Influenza vaccines generally show high efficacy, as measured by the antibody production in animal models or vaccinated people.[18] However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses.[19] However, in most years (16 of the 19 years before 2007), the flu vaccine strains have been a good match for the circulating strains,[20] and even a mismatched vaccine can often provide cross-protection.[21] Trials of both live and inactivated influenza vaccines against seasonal influenza have been summarized in several 2012 meta-analyses. Studies on live vaccines have very limited data, but these preparations may be more effective than inactivated vaccines.[22] The meta-analyses examined the efficacy and effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against seasonal influenza in adults,[4] children,[23] and the elderly.[24][25] The CDC recommend that everyone except children under the age of six months should receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.[7] Vaccination campaigns usually focus special attention on people who are at high risk of serious complications if they catch the flu, such as pregnant women, children over six months, the elderly, and people living with chronic illness or those with weakened immune systems, as well as those to whom they are exposed, such as health care workers.[7][26] As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the household contacts and caregivers of infants should be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant.[26] In children, vaccines again showed high efficacy, but low effectiveness in preventing ""flu-like illness"".[23] In children under the age of two the data are extremely limited, but vaccination appeared to confer no measurable benefit.[23] In the unvaccinated, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu while about 10% of the vaccinated do.[4] Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%.[4] No effect on hospitalization was found.[4] In working adults a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a very modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications.[4]  In healthy, working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons.[5] In health care workers, a 2006 review found a net benefit.[27] Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths.[27]  A 2014 review found benefits to patients when Health Care workers are immunized supported by moderate evidence,[28] based in part on the observed reduction in all-cause deaths in patients whose health care workers were given immunization compared with comparison patients in which the health care workers were not offered vaccine.[29] Evidence for an effect in adults over 65 years old is unclear.[30] Systematic reviews examining both randomized controlled and case control studies found a lack of high-quality evidence.[5][31] Reviews of case control studies found effects against laboratory-confirmed influenza, pneumonia, and death among the community-dwelling elderly.[32][33] The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age.[34] In a non-pandemic year, a person in the United States aged 50–64 is nearly ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than a younger person, and a person over age 65 is over ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than the 50–64 age group.[35] There is a new high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response.[36] Available evidence indicates that the vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine.[37] Vaccinating health care workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.[38][39][40] While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect the elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit.[41] As well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy.[42] The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV.[43] While side effects of the flu vaccine may occur, they are usually minor and the safety of flu vaccines is high. The flu vaccine can cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks of inoculation are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic's well-documented toll of illness, hospitalization, and death.[44] Flu vaccination may lead to side effects such as runny nose and sore throat, which can last for up to several days. Egg allergy may also be a concern, since flu vaccines are typically made using eggs;[45][46] however, research into egg-allergy and influenza vaccination[47] has led some advisory groups to recommend vaccine for those with mild allergies and monitored vaccination for those with severe.[48] A large study of nearly 800 children in the UK with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine.[49][50] On January 17, 2013, the U.S. FDA approved Flublok, a faster-turnaround influenza vaccine which is the first grown in insect cells instead of eggs. Since eggs are not used in its production it avoids the problem with egg allergies.[51] Although Guillain–Barré syndrome had been feared as a complication of vaccination, the CDC states that most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with Guillain–Barré.[52][53]  Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to 1 in 10,000) and increases the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately 10 times higher by 2009 estimates).[54][55] Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations,[56] a large study in China, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine covering close to 100 million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 ""swine"" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects; ""The risk-benefit ratio, which is what vaccines and everything in medicine is about, is overwhelmingly in favor of vaccination.""[57][58]  Several studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine,[59] efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger.[60] Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative. Despite some controversy in the media,[61] the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has concluded that there is no evidence of toxicity from thiomersal in vaccines and no reason on grounds of safety to change to more-expensive single-dose administration.[62] TIV induces protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective)[63] based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages.[64] Both types of flu vaccines are contraindicated for those with severe allergies to egg proteins and people with a history of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[69] In 2008, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, the group that advises the Public Health Agency of Canada, recommended that everyone aged 2 to 64 years be encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccination, and that children between the age of six and 24 months, and their household contacts, should be considered a high priority for the flu vaccine.[71] The NACI also recommends the flu vaccine for:[72] In the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months.[73][74][75] The U.S. government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. Some U.S. states and hundreds of U.S. hospitals require health-care workers to either get vaccinations or wear masks during flu season. These requirements occasionally engender union lawsuits on narrow collective bargaining grounds, but proponents note that courts have generally endorsed forced vaccination laws affecting the general population during disease outbreaks.[79] In USA : The CDC has indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, is not recommended for the 2016-2017 flu season, in the United States.[83] Furthermore, health care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons should receive injections (TIV or QIV) rather than LAIV.[84] In a 2010 survey of United States healthcare workers, 63.5% reported that they received the flu vaccine during the 2010–11 season, an increase from 61.9% reported the previous season. US Health professionals with direct patient contact had higher vaccination uptake, such as physicians and dentists (84.2%) and nurse practitioners (82.6%).[85][86][87] Flu vaccine is usually grown by vaccine manufacturers in fertilized chicken eggs.[88][89] In the Northern hemisphere, the manufacturing process begins following the announcement (typically in February) of the WHO recommended strains for the winter flu season.[88][90] Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs inoculated separately, these monovalent harvests are then combined to make the trivalent vaccine.[91] A DNA-based vaccination, which is hoped to be even faster to manufacture, is as of 2011 in clinical trials, determining safety and efficacy.[92] On November 20, 2012, Novartis received FDA approval for the first cell-culture vaccine.[93][94][95] In a 2007 report, the global capacity of approximately 826 million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the production of 413 million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8 billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly 2 billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than 3 billion courses would be required to serve these populations.[96] Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population. Methods of vaccine generation that bypass the need for eggs include the construction of influenza virus-like particles (VLP). VLP resemble viruses, but there is no need for inactivation, as they do not include viral coding elements, but merely present antigens in a similar manner to a virion. Some methods of producing VLP include cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells and plant-based vaccine production (e.g., production in Nicotiana benthamiana). There is evidence that some VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay (HIA).[97] Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are 11 to 12 days old.[98]  The top of the egg is disinfected by wiping it with alcohol and then the egg is candled to identify a non-veinous area in the allantoic cavity where a small hole is poked to serve as a pressure release.[99]  A second hole is made at the top of the egg, where the influenza virus is injected in the allantoic cavity, past the chorioallantoic membrane.  The two holes are then sealed with melted paraffin and the inoculated eggs are incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius.[98] During incubation time, the virus replicates and newly replicated viruses are released into the allantoic fluid  [100] After the 48 hour incubation period, the top of the egg is cracked and the 10 milliliters of allantoic fluid is removed, from which about 15 micrograms of the flu vaccine can be obtained.  At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers.[100] Done on a large scale, this method is used to produce the flu vaccine for the human population. Each year, three strains are chosen for selection in that year's flu vaccination by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. The chosen strains are the H1N1, H3N2, and Type-B strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season.  Starting with the 2012–2013 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (coincident with the approval of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), the WHO has also recommended a 2nd B-strain for use in quadrivalent vaccines. The World Health Organization coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network's selection of viruses for the vaccine manufacturing process is based on its best estimate of which strains will predominate the next year, amounting in the end to well-informed but fallible guesswork.[102] Formal WHO recommendations were first issued in 1973. Beginning in 1999 there have been two recommendations per year: one for the northern hemisphere (N) and the other for the southern hemisphere (S).[103] Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine are listed in a separate article. Recent WHO seasonal influenza vaccine composition recommendations: The WHO recommends that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses contain the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus.[104] WHO recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses should contain the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus.[105] †Strain A(H1N1)pdm09 is a newer name for the strain used in the 2009 flu pandemic vaccine.[106] Vaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Human vaccine is meant unless specifically identified as a veterinary, poultry or livestock vaccine. The first influenza pandemic was recorded in 1580.[107] the cause of influenza, the orthomyxoviridae was discovered by the Medical Research Council (MRC) of the United Kingdom in 1933.[108] † Because of lack of laboratory confirmation and underreporting among other factors, reported cases are ""likely to be a gross underestimation of the true number of fatalities associated with the [2009] pandemic.""[114] The 18,000 cases are those officially confirmed. Two statistical analyses, using different methods but producing similar results, estimated that the actual number was likely to be about ten times higher.[115][116] In the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, ""Physicians tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and sera (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzae—a name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agent—and several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.""[117] In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens' eggs was reported by Ernest William Goodpasture and colleagues at Vanderbilt University. The work was extended to growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Francis, Jonas Salk, Wilson Smith and Macfarlane Burnet, leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines.[118] In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War.[119] Hen's eggs continued to be used to produce virus used in influenza vaccines, but manufacturers made improvements in the purity of the virus by developing improved processes to remove egg proteins and to reduce systemic reactivity of the vaccine.[120]  Recently, the US FDA has approved influenza vaccines made by growing virus in cell cultures[121] and influenza vaccines made from recombinant proteins[122] have been approved, with plant-based influenza vaccines being tested in clinical trials.[123] According to the CDC: ""Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. [...] Vaccination is associated with reductions in influenza-related respiratory illness and physician visits among all age groups, hospitalization and death among persons at high risk, otitis media among children, and work absenteeism among adults. Although influenza vaccination levels increased substantially during the 1990s, further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed"".[124] The egg-based technology (still in use as of 2005) for producing influenza vaccine was created in the 1950s.[125] In the U.S. swine flu scare of 1976, President Gerald Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. Meanwhile, maximum military containment efforts succeeded unexpectedly in confining the new strain to the single army base where it had originated. On that base a number of soldiers fell severely ill, but only one died. The program was canceled, after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as 400 excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, illustrating that vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result has been cited to stoke lingering doubts about vaccination.[126] In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976.[127] Tom Jefferson, who has led Cochrane Collaboration reviews of flu vaccines, has called clinical evidence concerning flu vaccines ""rubbish"" and has therefore declared them to be ineffective; he has called for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.  His views on clinical trials are considered unethical by mainstream medicine and his views on the efficacy of vaccines are rejected by medical institutions including the CDC and the WHO, and by key figures in the field like  Anthony Fauci.[128] The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings.[129]  In the elderly (aged over 65 years) the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination.[130] In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations.[131] The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden,[132] as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine.[133][134] In healthy working adults (aged 18–49 years), a 2012 review found that vaccination was generally not cost-saving, with the suitability for funding being dependent on the willingness to pay to obtain the associated health benefits.[135] In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings.[136] Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it.[137] Influenza research includes molecular virology, molecular evolution, pathogenesis, host immune responses, genomics, and epidemiology. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies and diagnostic tools. Improved influenza countermeasures require basic research on how viruses enter cells, replicate, mutate, evolve into new strains and induce an immune response. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences[138]  that will help us understand what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current vaccine methods are being researched. A different approach is where Internet content is used to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Bing, and proposed a statistical framework which, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the percentage of influenza-like illness in areas, where vaccinations have been performed. Their impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England.[139] The rapid development, production, and distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines could potentially save millions of lives during an influenza pandemic. Due to the short time frame between identification of a pandemic strain and need for vaccination, researchers are looking at novel technologies for vaccine production that could provide better ""real-time"" access and be produced more affordably, thereby increasing access for people living in low- and moderate-income countries, where an influenza pandemic may likely originate, such as live attenuated (egg-based or cell-based) technology and recombinant technologies (proteins and virus-like particles).[140] As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.[141] In September 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.[142] A quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2012.[143][144] Fluarix Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in December 2012.[145] A ""universal vaccine"" that would not have to be designed and made for each flu season in each hemisphere would be useful, in order to stabilize the supply and to ensure against error in the design or escape of the circulating strains by mutation.  Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades.[146] One promising approach is using broadly neutralizing antibodies that unlike the vaccine used today, which provoke the body to generate an immune response, instead provide a component of the immune response itself.  The first neutralizing antibodies were identified in 1993 via experimentation; with time researchers understood that the flu neutralizing antibodies were binding to the stalk of the Hemagglutinin protein; later researchers identified antibodies that could bind to the head of those proteins. Later yet, researchers identified the highly conserved M2 proton channel as a potential target for broadly neutralizing antibodies.[146][147] The challenges for researchers have been identifying single antibodies that could neutralize many subtypes of the virus, so that they could be useful in any season, and that target conserved domains that are resistant to antigenic drift.[146] Another approach has been taking the conserved domains identified from these projects, and delivering groups of these antigens to provoke an immune response; various approaches with different antigens, presented different ways (as fusion proteins, mounted on virus-like particles, on non-pathogenic viruses, as DNA, and others), are under development.[147][148][149] Efforts have also been undertaken to develop universal vaccines that specifically activate a T-cell response, based on clinical data showing that people with a strong, early T-cell response have better outcomes when infected with influenza and because T-cells respond to conserved epitopes.  The challenge for developers is that these epitopes are on internal protein domains that are only mildly immunogenic.[147] Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have been experimenting with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response.[147][150] ""Vaccination in the veterinary world pursues four goals: (i) protection from clinical disease, (ii) protection from infection with virulent virus, (iii) protection from virus excretion, and (iv) serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (so-called DIVA principle). In the field of influenza vaccination, neither commercially available nor experimentally tested vaccines have been shown so far to fulfill all of these requirements.""[151] Horses with horse flu can run a fever, have a dry hacking cough, have a runny nose, and become depressed and reluctant to eat or drink for several days but usually recover in two to three weeks. ""Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of 2 doses, 3–6 weeks apart, followed by boosters at 6–12 month intervals. It is generally recognized that in many cases such schedules may not maintain protective levels of antibody and more frequent administration is advised in high-risk situations.""[152] It is a common requirement at shows in the United Kingdom that horses be vaccinated against equine flu and a vaccination card must be produced; the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) requires vaccination every six months.[153][154] Poultry vaccines for bird flu are made inexpensively and are not filtered and purified like human vaccines to remove bits of bacteria or other viruses. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Purification to standards needed for humans is far more expensive than the original creation of the unpurified vaccine from eggs. There is no market for veterinary vaccines that are that expensive. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. ""Chicken vaccinators who have accidentally jabbed themselves have developed painful swollen fingers or even lost thumbs, doctors said. Effectiveness may also be limited. Chicken vaccines are often only vaguely similar to circulating flu strains — some contain an H5N2 strain isolated in Mexico years ago. 'With a chicken, if you use a vaccine that's only 85 percent related, you'll get protection,' Dr. Cardona said. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99 percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. 'Chickens are smaller and you only need to protect them for six weeks, because that's how long they live till you eat them,' said Dr. John J. Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than 1 microgram. 'You have to be careful about extrapolating data from poultry to humans,' warned Dr. David E. Swayne, director of the agriculture department's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. 'Birds are more closely related to dinosaurs.'""[155] Researchers, led by Nicholas Savill of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, used mathematical models to simulate the spread of H5N1 and concluded that ""at least 95 percent of birds need to be protected to prevent the virus spreading silently. In practice, it is difficult to protect more than 90 percent of a flock; protection levels achieved by a vaccine are usually much lower than this.""[156] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination.[157] A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.[158] Swine origin influenza virus (SoIV) vaccines are extensively used in the swine industry in Europe and North America. Most swine flu vaccine manufacturers include an H1N1 and an H3N2 SoIV strains. Swine influenza has been recognized as a greater problem since the outbreak in 1976. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine origin flu vaccines are effective in controlling the problem when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.[159] SoIV vaccine manufacture Novartis paints this picture: ""A strain of swine origin influenza virus (SoIV) called H3N2, first identified in the US in 1998, has brought exasperating production losses to swine producers. Abortion storms are a common sign. Sows go off feed for two or three days and run a fever up to 106 °F (41 °C). Mortality in a naïve herd can run as high as 15%.""[160] In 2004, Influenza A virus subtype H3N8 was discovered to cause canine influenza. Because of the lack of previous exposure to this virus, dogs have no natural immunity to this virus. However, a vaccine is now available.[161]",JavaScript must be enabled in your browser to display the table of contents. © 2005 - 2023 Speedy Ceus®. All rights reserved. A CE Provider.,,,,,,,

It has long connected Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, enabling migration of people, cultures and religions. Manipur is primarily an agrarian economy, with significant hydroelectric power generation potential. The natural vegetation occupies an area of about 14,365 km² which is nearly 64% of the total geographical area of the state. The vegetation consists of a large variety of plants ranging from short and tall grasses, reeds and bamboos to trees of various species. Broadly, there are four types of forests - Tropical Semi-evergreen, Dry Temperate Forest, Sub-Tropical Pine and Tropical Moist Deciduous. Manipur has population of 25.7 Lakhs, an increase from figure of 22.94 Lakh. Total population of Manipur as per 2011 census is 2,570,390 of which male and female are 1,290,171 and 1,280,219 respectively. Total area of Manipur is 22,327 sq. km. Density of Manipur is 115 per sq km which is lower than national average 382 per sq km. In 2001, density of Manipur was 103 per sq km. Of the total population of Manipur state, around 67.55 percent live in the villages of rural areas. In actual numbers, males and females were 878,469 and 857,767 respectively. Total population of rural areas of Manipur state was 1,736,236. In rural areas of Manipur, literacy rate for males and female stood at 83.39 % and 67.03 %. Average literacy rate in Manipur for rural areas was 76.20 percent. Total literates in rural areas were 1,142,564. Least touched and least discovered Manipur promises to be the great tourist discovery of the21st century. An oval shaped valley surrounded by blue green hills, rich in art and tradition has inspired description such as the Switzerland of the East with its cascading rapids, tripling rivers, varieties of flowers, exotic blooms and lakes. The people of Manipur include Meitei, Nagas, Kuki-Chin-Mizo and Gorkhas groups and Muslims and other colorful communities which have lived in complete harmony for centuries. The Ministry of Tourism has five Regional offices located at Kolkata (East), Mumbai (West), Delhi (North), Chennai (South) and Guwahati (North East), which are headed by an officer of the level of Deputy Director General designated as Regional Director. Domestic tourists intending to visit Manipur by road via Dimapur/Kohima require Inner Line Permits to pass through Nagaland. These are issued by the Liaison officers of the Government of Nagaland at New Delhi, Calcutta, Guwahati, Shillong and the Sub-divisional officer (Civil), Dimapur, deputy Commissioner, Imphal can also issue permits to tourists traveling by road from imphal to Kohima and Dimapur in Nagaland. The Information Technology and IT Enabled Services sector in India is looking towards Tier-II and Tier-III cities to meet the growing demands of the industry for sourcing its required skilled manpower. The youth of Manipur have not only excelled in the field of Sports, but have already established a noticeable presence in the ITES industry in India. Manipur State is striving to score higher on being business-friendly in terms of the available IT infrastructure. These include: •        Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) unit of Imphal with Earth station and OFC connectivity. •        Up gradation of IT infrastructure at Imphal to provide modern Business-ready built-up office space for IT/ITES firms. •        Internet on the move – Various Telcos like BSNL, Tata Indicom, Airtel etc. are providing Wireless Internet across the State. A high rate of unemployment exists in Manipur, particularly among the educated youth. According to the Live Register of Employment Exchange, the total number of educated job-seekers were recorded as 5, 83.65 thousands. Manipur is rich in natural resources but due to difficult terrain, inadequate infrastructural facilities and varying climatic conditions, the state could not develop much in the industrial sector of its economy. In the initial stage, Govt. policy in the state was one of revival and revitalization of the traditional handlooms and handicrafts of the local habitats. The contribution of the manufacturing sector to the total gross state domestic product at current prices is found to be 6.17 percent. The trend of industrial development and the present local conditions of the state and in consonance with industrial policy of the Government of India, the Govt. of Manipur in its policy announcement of 1990, has decided to focus attention to the small scale and agro-based industries without discouraging the medium and large-scale industries. It is expected to serve the objective of employment generation and dispersal of industries in rural and urban areas. The state has laid emphasis on creating a strong industrial base and employment opportunities in the state through provision of various growth inducing factors based on locally available resources. It is based on locally available raw materials and minerals. In order to promote rapid industrialization, the State Government has over the years been offering attractive package of incentives and concessions to invigorative industries. The khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) was established by the Govt. of India in the year 1957. The Khadi and Village Industries is not only providing employment to people in rural and semi-urban areas at low investment per job, but also utilizes local skill resources and provides part-time as well as full time work to rural artisans, women and minorities. The traditional sector of industries falls within the purview of organizations such as Khadi and Village Industries Commission. The KVIC include artisans in tiny industrial units and defines it as any industry located in a village or town inhabited by population not exceeding 10000 which produces goods and renders services with or without the use of power in which the fixed capital per head does not exceed Rs.15000. Growth Centres are large villages or small towns which have the potential to become the nuclei for the socio-economic development of the surrounding area. The Growth Centres can be identified by the different orders with respect to the quality and quantity of services and facilities, service area and population. A growth centre of lowest order should have services such as agricultural input centre, primary and middle school, maternity and child care centres and daily market. Small-Scale Industries (SSI) is an important segment of the economy, contributing substantially in the form of production, employment and exports. It has continued to play a vital role in the fulfillment of socio-economic objectives. The principal factor for defining small-scale Industries has always been based on the size of investment. Small-Scale Industries are those industries whose investment in fixed assets such as plants and machineries does not exceed Rs.100.00 lakhs (Rs.1 Crore). Investment in plant and machinery in respect of industry related Small-Scale Service and Business Enterprises (SSSBE) were increased to Rs.10.00 lakhs from Rs.5.00 lakhs. For speedy growth of small-scale industries, the Government has already brought about simplifications in the SSI registration procedures. The State Government has introduced this Policy with various components being offered such as, incentives, improved infrastructure facilities, supply of quality power, and credit flow from Bank and Financial institutions, better market linkages and to boost investor confidence. •        All round economic development and to improve living standards. •        Employment opportunities. •        Optimal utilization of both natural and physical resources. •        Develop adequate infrastructures to ensure planned and accelerated industrial development. •        Promote maximum capital investment in the State for economic activities resulting in employment opportunities, improving standard of living of people at large and all-round development of the State. •        Promote modernization and technology up-gradation of existing industrial units. •        Encourage quality control, standardization and competitiveness of local products. •        Promote eco-friendly industries. •             Bio-Technology industries. •             Floriculture. •             Handloom and Handicraft. •             Medicinal Plants. •             Distillation of oils from aromatic plants. •             Mineral based industries. •             Information Technology Trade and Commerce under Export Import mechanisms.

what are poseidon's symbols and what do they mean,"In Greek myth, Poseidon used his trident to create water sources in Greece and the horse. Poseidon, as well as being god of the sea, was also known as the ""Earth Shaker"" because when he struck the earth in anger he caused mighty earthquakes and he used his trident to stir up tidal waves, tsunamis and sea storms. Parallel to its fishing origins, the trident is associated with Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology, the Roman god Neptune.","Trident tattoo designs are usually related to the strength of the gods. The Trident is a mythological and magical weapon in the shape of a three-pointed spear belonging to the gods of the sea. It is a symbol of power over the seas and waters but it is also associated with thunderstorms. In Greek mythology, the trident is connected with Poseidon, the god of the sea. Poseidon and his equivalent in Roman myth, Neptune, used the trident to create water sources, but in anger, he struck the earth causing mighty earthquakes, stir up tidal waves, tsunamis, and sea storms. In Hindu legends, God Shiva used the trident or ‘trishula’ to fight off negativity and evil.

the relationship between the roles of brca genes in dna repair and cancer predisposition,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where they help repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. They are involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. If BRCA1 or BRCA2 itself is damaged by a BRCA mutation, damaged DNA is not repaired properly, and this increases the risk for breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been described as ""breast cancer susceptibility genes"" and ""breast cancer susceptibility proteins"". The predominate allele has a normal, tumor suppressive function whereas high penetrance mutations in these genes cause a loss of tumor suppressive function which correlates with an increased risk of breast cancer.","Inherited mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with a markedly increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Exactly how these mutations cause this increased risk has been the subject of much research over the last 20 years. Learning more about the functions of these genes could help us develop prophylactic strategies to reduce this risk in BRCA mutation carriers—as well as better chemotherapeutics to treat tumors that harbor BRCA mutations. Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene are a major cause of familial breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression. Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) tumor suppressor are a common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein harbors an N-terminal RING motif characteristic of many ubiquitin E3 ligases and two BRCA C terminus (BRCT) motifs that form a phosphoprotein recognition domain (1–4). BRCA1 interacts with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) to form a potent E3 ligase (5, 6) that is thought to regulate multiple pathways, including those responsible for tumor suppression (1–4). To test whether the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is essential for tumor suppression, we examined mice that express Brca1FH-I26A, an enzymatically defective protein with a missense mutation (I26A) in the RING domain that allows assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer but abrogates its E3 ligase activity (7, 8). (Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr. In the mutants, other amino acids were substituted at certain locations; for example, I26A indicates that isoleucine at position 26 was replaced by alanine.) Brca1FH-I26A/+and Brca1FH-WT/+ mice were generated from isogenic embryonic stem (ES) cells that express either Brca1FH-I26A or the corresponding wild-type Brca1FH-WT protein (9) and bred to homozygosity. Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A pups were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and survived to adulthood. Because Brca1-null mice invariably undergo embryonic lethality (10, 11), the viability of Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mice indicates that E3 ligase activity is not essential for all BRCA1 functions. Nonetheless, Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A, but not Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT, males are sterile and have smaller testes, and their seminiferous tubules lack elongated spermatids and spermatozoa (fig. S1), which suggests a block in spermatogenesis. Apart from male sterility and a modest decrease in adult body weight (5 to 10%), Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mice appear indistinguishable from their Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT littermates. Moreover, analyses of Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed that the I26A mutation had no measurable effect on cellular proliferation, chromosomal stability, senescence induction, centrosome number, spindle formation, resistance to genotoxic stress, or ubiquitin foci formation at sites of DNA damage—unlike the hypomorphic Brca1 lesions in MEFs of Brca1tr/tr (12) and Brca1Δ11/Δ11 mice (13), which are known to disrupt tumor suppression (fig. S2). To evaluate whether the E3 ligase activity affects tumor suppression, we initially used a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which the Pdx1-cre transgene triggers KrasG12D and p53R172H expression in pancreatic progenitor cells (14). To test whether Brca1 suppresses formation of these tumors, we generated Pdx1-cre animals carrying KrasLSL-G12D (14) together with conditional-null Brca1flex2 (15) and/or p53flex7 (16) alleles. Although double-mutant KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice succumbed to pancreatic tumors with an average latency (T50) of 68 days, tumor latency was dramatically reduced in triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) with conditional-null Brca1flex2 (T50 = 40 days; P < 0.0001), indicating that wild-type Brca1 suppresses pancreatic tumor development (Fig. 1A). In contrast, triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Pdx1-cre) expressing Brca1FH-I26A developed pancreatic tumors with a similar latency (T50 = 65 days) as that of double-mutant KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice (T50 = 68 days; P = 0.2595) (Fig. 1A). Thus, the tumor suppression potential of enzymatically inactive Brca1 in the pancreas is indistinguishable from that of wild-type Brca1. Fig. 1.   The enzymatic activity of Brca1 is dispensable for tumor suppression. (A) Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curves of KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre (KPC-Brca1+/+; black curve;T50 = 68 days) mice compared with KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre/Brca1flex2/flex2 (KPC-Brca1flex2/flex2; blue curve; T50 = 40 days; P < 0.0001) and KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre/Brca1flex2/FH-I26A (KPC-Brca1flex2/FH-I26A; red curve; T50 = 65 days; P = 0.2595) mice.

(D) Kaplan-Meier survival curves of control Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT (black curve) mice compared with Brca1tr/tr (blue curve; T50 = 529 days; P < 0.0001) and Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A and Brca1FH-I26A/– (red curve; P = 0.5197) mice. These graphs (as well as those in Figure 3) show the percentage of mice that have survived tumor free (Y-axis) after a certain amount of time (X-axis). The researchers made note of how many mice were tumor-free each day, and then translated these data into a graph at the end of the study period. The T50 numbers shown are the times it took for half of the mice to develop tumors. The higher the T50, the better that mouse (or more specifically here, that BRCA1 allele) is at suppressing tumor formation. Note that the X-axes for these panels are very different in scale because the breast tumor models (panels B, C, and D) take much longer to develop compared to the pancreatic tumor model (panel A). In this mouse pancreatic cancer model, the mice have mutations in the oncogene KRAS and the tumor suppressor p53, in addition to different alleles of BRCA1. The flex2 allele of BRCA1 is a null mutation (completely defective), while the I26A allele is a hypomorphic mutation that only abrogates BRCA1 enzymatic function. Notably, the I26A allele (red) is just as effective at suppressing tumors as the normal BRCA1 (black). Notice in the key that the red curve has a flex2 and I26A allele. This mouse is a heterozygote, meaning it has two different copies (alleles) of the BRCA1 gene. Even though this mouse has one defective copy of BRCA1 (flex2), the single I26A copy is sufficient to provide normal tumor-suppression function. In this breast cancer mouse model, the KRAS and p53 mutations are taken out of the equation, and only the BRCA1 mutation is considered. Notice that the scale of the X-axis is eight times as large as the X-axis in panel A. The absence of the background mutations may in part account for the longer latency of  the tumor-free state in the breast cancer model (relative to the prostate cancer model). In fact, all of the mice with the I26A mutation remained breast tumor-free during the experiment. Something else to notice about the X-axis: This experiment took 2 years to complete! That's about the average lifespan of a lab mouse, so they were observed for their entire lifetime. This is another breast cancer model, but the p53 mutation is present in addition to the different BRCA1 alleles. KRAS is normal (not mutated). The X-axis here is shorter than that of B (only BRCA1 mutations), but longer than that of A (KRAS, p53 and BRCA1 mutations). For comparison, the T50 of the flex2/flex2 mice (BRCA1 null mutant) without p53 or KRAS mutations was 512 days (C, blue). Adding the p53 mutation reduced it to 309 days (B, green). Adding the KRAS and p53 mutations and moving the tumor induction to the pancreas reduced the T50 to only 40 days (A, blue). This gives you a sense of how cancer is a genetic disease involving multiple mutations. As the mutations accumulate and alter multiple cellular pathways (cell division, cell signaling, DNA repair, etc.), the cancer becomes more aggressive. Here, the researchers looked at spontaneous tumor formation instead of inducing specific tumors of the breast or pancreas. The time scale here is comparable to the experiment in B, most likely because in both D and B, the KRAS and p53 mutations are not present, just different BRCA1 alleles. The authors also introduce another mutant, the truncation (tr) mutant of BRCA1, which lacks the critical BRCT domains at the C-terminus of the protein. Notice that mice bearing this mutant are much worse off than the normal (black) or I26A mutant (red) mice. The tr mutant looks similar to the flex2/flex2 null mutant (B, green), and they have comparable T50s. We next applied a mouse model of familial breast cancer in which the Wapcre gene elicits mammary-specific inactivation of the conditional-null Brca1flex2 allele (15). However, unlike Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+ females, which form tumors resembling the basal-like breast carcinomas of human BRCA1 mutation carriers (15), all mice expressing enzymatically inactive Brca1 (Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Wapcre/+) remained tumor-free over the 24-month observation period (Fig. 1B). We also monitored three cohorts of Wapcre/+ mice sensitized for tumor development by a conditional p53 mutation (p53LSL-R270H). Whereas mammary tumors developed in control p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females with an average latency of 380 days, which is consistent with previous studies (17), tumor formation was accelerated (T50= 308 days) by conditional Brca1 inactivation in Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of tumor development in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females was indistinguishable from that of control p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P = 0.7502) and significantly slower than that of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, representative oligonucleotide microarray analysis (18) revealed a “simplex” pattern of genomic copy number variation in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors, similar to that of p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors but distinct from the “complex sawtooth” pattern of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors (fig. S3). Thus, mammary-specific loss of Brca1 enzymatic activity does not promote basal-like breast carcinoma in a manner analogous to complete Brca1 inactivation. Although mice lacking Brca1 enzymatic activity (Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A and Brca1FH-I26A/–) are viable, some (18.6%) died of tumors at a very advanced age (Fig. 1D). However, the frequency and kinetics of spontaneous tumor formation in the mutant mice were comparable with those of Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT control animals (P = 0.5197) and significantly lower than those of Brca1tr/tr mice (P < 0.0001) (12). Thus, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for tumor suppression in each of the three GEM cancer models. The BRCT motifs of BRCA1 form a phospho-recognition domain that preferentially binds the phosphorylated isoforms of repair proteins Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP (1, 2). Because most tumor-associated BRCA1 alleles have frameshift/nonsense mutations that eliminate one or both BRCT motifs, BRCT phospho-recognition may be critical for tumor suppression. Indeed, in some families breast cancer susceptibility can be ascribed to missense mutations that cause a single amino acid substitution (for example, S1655F) that disrupts the interaction between the BRCT domain and its cognate phospho-ligands. Structural studies show that BRCA1 residue S1655 donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate group of these phospho-ligands, and that mutation of this residue disrupts their interaction with BRCA1 (19–23). To determine whether BRCT phospho-recognition is required for genome stability and tumor suppression, we mutated the corresponding mouse residue (S1598F) to generate heterozygous (Brca1S1598F/+) and homozygous (Brca1S1598F/S1598F) ES clones (fig. S4). The Brca1S1598F/+ ES cells were injected into blastocysts to derive germline chimeras, and heterozygous animals were then intercrossed to produce homozygous Brca1S1598F/S1598F offspring, which appeared at the expected Mendelian ratio. Apart from male sterility, these mice developed normally and provided a source of Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs. The mutant Brca1 protein of Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs is expressed at normal levels and fails to bind Bach1/FancJ (Fig. 2A). Brca1S1598F/S1598F ES cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress (Fig. 2B) and defective for homology-directed DNA repair (Fig. 2C). In addition, Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs display proliferation defects, chromosomal instability, centrosome amplification, and diminished recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage (figs. S5 and S6). Thus, the S1598F mutation disrupts BRCA1 function in the DNA damage response. To evaluate its effect on tumor suppression, we monitored an experimental cohort of Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females and control cohorts of the p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+,Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+, and Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females described above (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 3A, mammary tumorigenesis was accelerated in experimental Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ mice (T50 = 308 days) relative to p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ animals (T50 = 380 days; P < 0.0001), and the shortened latency was indistinguishable from that of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+animals (T50 = 309 days; P = 0.4543). Thus, the S1598F mutation impairs mammary tumor suppression to a comparable degree as does complete Brca1 inactivation. Pancreatic tumor formation in mice expressing Brca1S1598F (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/S1598F/Pdx1-cre; T50 = 45 days) was also accelerated relative to those expressing wild-type Brca1 (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice; T50 = 68 days; P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3B) and comparable with conditional-null Brca1 mice (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) (T50 = 40 days; P = 0.2632). Furthermore, homozygous Brca1S1598F/S1598F mice were highly tumor-prone (49 out of 72; 68.1%) relative to control animals (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Thus, BRCT phospho-recognition is critical for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression in all three GEM cancer models. Fig. 2. The BRCT phospho-recognition property of Brca1 is critical for the DNA damage response. (A) S1598F ablates the interaction between Bach1/FancJ and endogenous Brca1. MEFs were prepared from mice with a knock-in allele (Bach1WT-FH) encoding wild-type Bach1 with C-terminal Flag-hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes. Bach1WT-FH and Brca1 levels were examined by immunoblotting lysates of Brca1+/+/Bach1WT-FH/+and Brca1S1598F/S1598F/Bach1WT-FH/+ MEFs (left). To evaluate the Brca1/Bach1WT-FH interaction, lysates were immunoprecipitated with a Brca1-specific antiserum or corresponding preimmune serum (pre) and immunoblotted with HA-specific antibodies (right). The input (left) represents 2.5% of the protein amount used for immunoprecipitation (right). (B) Brca1S1598F/S1598F cells are sensitive to genotoxic stress. ES cells proficient (Brca1+/– and Brca1S1598F/+) or deficient (Brca1S1598F/S1598F) for BRCT phospho-recognition were examined for mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity in clonogenic survival assays, together with ES cells homozygous for the hypomorphic Brca1Δ223-763 mutation. (C) BRCT phospho-recognition by Brca1 is essential for homology-directed DNA repair. Brca1+/–, Brca1S1598F/S1598F, and Brca1Δ223-763/Δ223-763 ES subclones containing the direct repeat–green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) substrate integrated into the Pim1 locus were transfected with either an I-SceI expression vector or empty vector. I-SceI strongly induced the number of GFP-positive cells in Brca1+/– cells (clone 4), indicating efficient homology-directed repair, but not in Brca1S1598F/S1598F cells (clones 1 to 3). The reduction in GFP-positive cells in Brca1S1598F/S1598F cells was similar to that of Brca1Δ223-763/Δ223-763 ES cells (clone 5), which are known to be deficient in homology-directed repair (28). This Figure examines the cellular effects of a mutation (S1598) that ablates the BRCT phospho-recognition property of BRCA1. This technique allows researchers to look at protein-protein interactions. First, one protein is isolated or ""pulled down"" using an antibody that targets that protein. Next, the pulled-down material is analyzed for the presence of a second protein, using another antibody that targets that protein. If a band appears in a particular lane of an IP, the two proteins interact under the particular conditions of that lane. Here, the authors ran an immunoprecipitation assay to test for interactions between BRCA1 and one of its know BRCT phospho-ligands (called BACH1 or FANCJ). They started by pulling down BRCA1 protein, and then looked to see if BACH1 was present (bound to BRCA1). The box on the right is the most important: When BRCA1 is normal (+/+), BACH1 interacts with it. In the S1598F mutant (SF/SF), BACH1 is not present, indicating that the interaction between these two proteins is abolished by this mutation. This is an analysis of sensitivity to a DNA damaging agent, mitomycin C (MMC). MMC induces covalent links between DNA strands, which can cause problems during DNA replication. If a cell is deficient in DNA repair, this damage will accumulate and start to kill the cells. The authors compared cells with different alleles of BRCA1 to see which ones best survived treatment with MMC. The cells with at least one copy of normal BRCA1 (open squares and black diamonds) survive fairly well until the highest doses. In contrast, the S1598F mutant and another mutant, Δ223-763, do not survive MMC treatment. This result indicates that the cells with those BRCA1 mutations are defective in DNA repair. Notice the Y-axis is logarithmic, meaning the scale changes as you move up or down the axis. This is another analysis of DNA repair capability. The authors designed a construct that can code for the fluorescent protein GFP. But it is set up in such a way that it can only express the protein if it is cut and then repaired by homology-directed repair. I-SceI is an enzyme that cuts DNA at a specific sequence in the GFP construct. If homology-directed repair is functional, GFP expression will increase after I-SceI is added. The only clone where this is the case is #4, which is also the only clone with a normal (+) copy of BRCA1. The others have mutant BRCA1 proteins, and are therefore defective in homology-directed repair. Fig. 3. BRCT phospho-recognition is essential for Brca1 tumor suppression. (A) Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curves of p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ (PC-Brca1+/+; black curve; T50 = 380 days) females compared with Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ (PC-Brca1flex2/flex2; blue curve; T50 = 309 days;P < 0.0001) and Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ (PC-Brca1flex2/S1598F; green curve; T50 = 308 days; P < 0.0001) females.

(C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves of Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT (black curve) mice compared with Brca1tr/tr (blue curve; P < 0.0001) and Brca1S1598F/S1598F (green curve; P < 0.0001) mice. To make the S1598F mutant mice, the authors created mutant forms of BRCA1 and introduced them into embryos. For a simplified explanation of how scientists create mice with specific mutations using embryonic stem cells, watch this video. Figure 3 uses the same Kaplan-Meier curves and the mouse cancer models used in Figure 1. Panel A  is analogous to Figure 1C in that the authors are using the same model. Here, the authors show that mice with the S1598F mutation survive the induced breast cancer as well as those with null mutations (flex2) in BRCA1. Here, the authors have induced mutations in both KRAS and p53 in pancreatic tissue. The corresponding panel (identical mouse model) is seen in panel A of Figure 1. When either a null mutation (flex2) or the hypomorphic S1598F missense mutation is introduced into BRCA1, the tumor-free survival time decreases as compared to the normal copy of BRCA1. As with the different panels in Figure 1, the X-axis in panel B is very different in scale than A. The addition of the KRAS mutation and moving the tumor induction to the pancreas has dramatically decreased the survival time. This figure is analogous to panel D in Figure 1. Instead of inducing tumors in specific tissues, the authors monitored mice with different Brca1 alleles for tumor development in any tissue. Note that the tumor-free survival curve of S1598F-mutant mice resembles that of the BRCA1 truncated (tr) mutant mice. However, the average survival time of both mutants is less than that of normal BRCA1 (FH-WT) mice. BRCA1 is thought to regulate diverse cellular processes by ubiquitinating multiple protein substrates (1–4). Indeed, on the basis of the same mutation (I26A) used here the E3 ligase activity has been implicated in BRCA1 control of centrosome duplication (24), checkpoint activation (25), mitotic spindle assembly (26), and tumor cell motility (27). In light of these observations, the viability of mice lacking BRCA1 enzymatic activity was unexpected. Because mice homozygous for null Brca1 mutations undergo embryonic lethality (10, 11), our results suggest that the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for much of normal development. Thus, many of the known and unknown functions of BRCA1 may be mediated independent of its ability to catalyze ubiquitination. From a medical standpoint, the key function of BRCA1 is its ability to suppress tumor formation in breast and ovarian tissues. Like BRCA1, many other oncoproteins and tumor suppressors possess enzymatic activity. In most cases, the enzymatic function has proven to be integral to the oncogenic process, and in some cases it can be targeted for therapeutic gain, as illustrated by the clinical success of certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, because enzymatically inert Brca1 is sufficient to suppress tumor formation in several settings (Fig. 1), including a model of human basal-like breast cancer, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 appears to be dispensable for tumor suppression. A role for the E3 ligase activity in BRCA1 tumor suppression was predicated partly on the fact that this activity is ablated by certain tumor-associated lesions of the RING domain, such as the C61G and C64G missense mutations (6). However, these mutations also disrupt the interaction between BRCA1 and its partner protein BARD1 (5). Because mammary-specific inactivation of either Brca1 or Bard1 elicits breast tumors with the same basal-like phenotype (15), the tumor suppression activity of BRCA1 is probably mediated by the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. Unlike the tumorigenic C61G and C64G mutations, the synthetic I26A mutation used in this study specifically ablates the enzymatic activity of BRCA1 but allows proper assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (7). Thus, the tumorigenic RING mutations are likely to compromise BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression primarily by impairing BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimerization. The mouse model of hereditary breast cancer has provided meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. First, the identical pattern of breast carcinogenesis in conditional Brca1-,Bard1-, and Brca1/Bard1-null mice implies that tumor suppression is dependent on the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (15). Second, as shown here tumor suppression does not require the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1. Third, our data also suggest that the ability of the BRCT domain to bind its phospho-ligands is critical for BRCA1 tumor suppression. In light of this result, it is noteworthy that BRCA1/BARD1 forms distinct protein complexes (A, B, and C) based on BRCT-mediated interactions with three different repair proteins (Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP) (1, 2). Because tumor suppression appears to be dependent on BRCA1 association with one or more of these BRCT phospho-ligands (and/or others yet to be discovered), these interactions may provide valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.

why do tokyo and kyoto have the same letters,"In Japanese, the city has been called Kyō (京), Miyako (都), or Kyō no Miyako (京 の 都). In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto (""capital city""), after the Chinese word for capital city, jingdu (京都). After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (東京, meaning ""Eastern Capital"") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saikyō (西京, meaning ""Western Capital""). Contemporary Kyoto is occasionally referred to as thousand-year capital (千年 の 都).","Possibilities are tremendous but task is daunting…this is what I feel…but not our PM. I visited Varanasi some 20 years ago but memories have come alive while watching PM in Japan. As I know Varanasi, the city of Kashi Vishwanath temple, Dhashdhmedh Ghat, Manikarnika Ghat, BHU, IIT, Sarnath, Five – Star Hotels, Tourists, Gangaji ki Aarti…it has tremendous potential as a tourist destination but for its infrastructure. Now that it has caught attention of our PM, it cannot escape transformation. PM’s main agenda of this visit to Japan. So what are the similarities, what are the differences, what are the opportunities and what are the threats? For this, it is important to know how splendid is Japanese city Kyoto. Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Osaka on August 30 and, within hours, oversaw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe to turn Varanasi into a ‘smart city’ with help from Kyoto. The pact is in line with Modi’s vision of building 100 ‘smart cities’ across India. Under the smart heritage cities programme, Kyoto will provide cooperation in the fields of conservation and modernisation of cities, as well as art, culture and academics. While Kyoto and Kashi share many similarities historically, there is a wide gap in where they stand today. First, the similarities: Kyoto is called the city of ten thousand shrines, while Varanasi boasts of numerous temples and ghats. Kyoto has been the imperial capital of Japan for more than 1,000 years, while Varanasi is considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Both cities also have rivers flowing alongside them. Now, the differences: Kyoto has modernised while keeping its old city, temples and monuments alive, while Varanasi has languished in its past glory. Kyoto’s streets are wide and clean, with magnificent tree-lined boulevards — something Modi witnessed on his way to the luxurious Westin hotel. Varanasi’s squalor and narrow roads have prompted the PM to resolve to clean up the city. Varanasi’s Ganga river is polluted and the ghats need repair, while Kyoto has a number of rivers, canals and other navigable waterways. While Yodo, Kamogawa and Katsura rivers flow through Kyoto, its Late Biwa canal is a major infrastructure milestone. These differences are likely to be highlighted by Kyoto’s mayor Daisaku Kadokawa in his a presentation to Modi on the subject. Modi’s plan of 100 ‘smart cities’ is one of the major focus areas during the visit. The Prime Minister is keen on rejuvenating Indian cities as urban centres, and Kyoto is a magnificent example of how a city preserves its cultural heritage while modernising itself. It, therefore, dovetails into PM’s own emphasis on rejuvenation of cities in India while preserving their cultural heritage as also his focus on what is widely known as ‘smart cities’. Kyoto, in the Japanese lexicon, is known as a smart city which is environmentally friendly, which preserves its heritage and which is at the cutting-edge of technology. Could you see some parallels between Kyoto and Varanasi? Yes we can ancient history, culture, heritage, holiness, temples, art & craft, rivers, Ghats, Education and IT Hub, food and cuisine. No wonder Modiji has chosen Japan to do the job of transforming on the lines of Kyoto. I thought of sharing history and present of Kyoto city of Japan on which Varanasi’s transformation has been modelled, traditional, cultural yet modern. Indeed the task is humongous, but worth trying. Probably it will be the most challenging task for Japan…but Japanese love challenges! Let me share with you, what is the challenge is all about. How did this elaborate transformation happened? What it will take to transform Varanasi? The city suffered extensive destruction in the Ōnin War of 1467-1477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. Battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve the court nobility (kuge) and religious factions as well. Nobles’ mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since. There was some consideration by the United States of targeting Kyoto with an atomic bomb at the end of World War II because, as an intellectual center of Japan, it had a population “better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon.” In the end, at the insistence of Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by Nagasaki. As a result, the Imperial City (Emeritus), of Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as machiya. However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the Kyōto Station complex. Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. Kyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, with a height just above 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) above sea level. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the Ujigawa to the south, the Katsuragawa to the west, and the Kamogawa to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in the prefecture with an area of 827.9 square kilometres (319.7 sq mi). The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang’an (present-day Xi’an). The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Ukyō (the right sector of the capital) being on the west while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Nakagyō, Shimogyō, and Kamigyō-ku still follow a grid pattern. Today, the main business district is located to the south of the old Imperial Palace, with the less-populated northern area retaining a far greener feel. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names. Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate. With its 2000 religious places- 1600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrinesas well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact, it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: The Kyoto Gyoen area including the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sento Imperial Palace, homes of the Emperors of Japan for many centuries; Katsura Imperial Villa, one of the nation’s finest architectural treasures; and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa, one of its best Japanese gardens. In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from Shijō to Kōmei. Other sites in Kyoto include Arashiyama, the Gion and Pontochō geisha quarters, the Philosopher’s Walk, and the canals which line some of the older streets. Traditional Japanese crafts are also major industry of Kyoto, most of which are run by artisans in small plants. Kyoto’s kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Such businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as sales of traditional goods stagnate. Kyoto Station is the center for transportation in the city. The second-largest in Japan, it houses a shopping mall, hotel, movie theater, Isetan department store, and several local government facilities all under one fifteen-story roof. We don’t give little old Europe enough credit. Packed into a comparably small space to that of the rest of the world, it has pretty much got everything covered. From beaches to glaciers, our little continent has plenty to offer those unable to trot across the globe. So for every iconic picture you see of some Caribbean coastline or Himalayan mountain range, just remember that there might be an equally bucket list worthy alternative right on your doorstep (or indeed a budget airline flight away).  Plan your trip on skyscanner.com but not before comparing two identicals so that you get the levy towards finanlising your budget and make headway towards your journey. Mexico’s beaches vs. Greece’s beaches Many people dream of visiting one of Mexico’s beaches, to drink Mojitos and soak up the sun, but if you’re not able to make the 10 hour flight then a great alternative has to be Greece – one of the best countries for a full-proof beach holiday. Some of the most spectacular have to be in Zante, their white sands and clear waters make them a popular sunbathing spot. Australia’s coastline vs. Portugal’s Algarve Australia’s Twelve Apostles limestone stacks in Victoria are incredible, but Portugal’s Praia da Marinha also packs a punch. The famous Algarve beach is surrounded by crooked rocks and cliffs and has many coves and caves to explore. Mongolian Desert vs. Gran Canaria The Gobi desert is a fascinating place – there really is something romantic about the idea of setting forth into the wilderness to experience the isolation of this inhospitable environment, with only a camel as your companion. However, you can still experience a desert adventure while on your holidays in the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. Lying on the same latitude as the Sahara, it’s no surprise that the south of the island has some impressive sand dunes… and yes, you can still visit them by camel. Chile’s glaciers vs. Iceland’s glaciers If this is something on your bucket list, maybe think about saving up for it sooner rather than later. Patagonia’s San Rafael Glacier is melting fast and experts estimate that it will have completely disappeared by 2030. BUT, if you don’t make it across the world in time, Iceland has some of the world’s most incredible ice structures – it’s in the name I guess. Glacier walks are a popular day trip for many tourists (Icelandic Mountain Guides offer a variety of tours) and chances are you might get to tick ‘seeing the northern lights’ off your list too. Many head to Thailand to island hop around some of Southeast Asia’s most beautiful islands. However, in Europe there are plenty of opportunities to do the same. If you don’t fancy going so far away, Italy has many islands from large, popular ones such as Sardinia and Sicily to many more remote ones such as the Pelagi islands, two of which are completely unpopulated. You will still be able to enjoy fantastic weather and gorgeous scenery – without the long-haul flight. Thai lakes vs. Croatian lakes The likes of Cheow Lan Lake in Khao Sok National Park are enough to make anyone hop on a plane to Thailand but Croatia’s Plitvice Lakes’ rushing waterfalls and lush surrounding forests make it an equally popular place to visit – and justifiably so. New Zealand’s mountain ranges vs. Italian mountain ranges New Zealand is the ultimate adventure destination. It’s sprawling mountain ranges make it top of many avid hiker’s travel wish-list, wishing to tackle one of the nine ‘Great Hikes’ and witness some spectacular scenery at the same time. If your budget doesn’t allow you an around the world ticket, Italy’s Alps, Dolomites and Appennino mountain ranges still allow the trepid explorer to lace up their hiking boots and explore the rocky terrain. Nepal’s Mountains vs. Swiss Alps Nepal has Everest. And seven other mountains that are among the top ten in the world. Fair enough. Keep them on your to do list. Europe’s mountains may not be able to compete in height, but they certainly can in scenery. The snow covered Swiss Alps for example, are unbelievably beautiful and are a rewarding hike for anyone willing and able to tackle them. Indonesia’s volcanoes vs. Canary Islands’ volcanoes Many travel to Indonesia to stand face to face with some of the earth’s most violent and active volcanos. There are over 120 here that frequently erupt, making Indonesia the most geographically unstable country in the world. If you fancy your tumultuous volcanic activity in a slightly smaller, and closer to home scale, the Canary Islands have a chain of seven across the islands. Mount Teide in Tenerife boasts the title of being the highest peek in Spain and the third biggest volcano on earth. Surely that’s worth a visit? Courtesy: Skyscanner.com Bali has been a dream destination for me, I have always yearned to visit Bali for some reason since 1995 (since my marriage) but that was not to be. The history, the culture, the beaches, the temples, the wild-life, the waterfalls and the shopping has always fascinated me in Bali. It is a complete package for the wanderer, adventurer, worshipper and shopper in me. I am planning my second honeymoon to Bali with the help of skyscanner.com. I started my search for the cheap flight as I am based out of Mumbai and need to fly to Bali, Indonesia. After filling the dates of travel and destination details, I had a host of options before me of flights offering very competitive rates. I zeroed in for Malaysian Air flight to fly on October 24th and return on October 30th, 2014. The price of ticket is unbelievable…at just Rs. 34,000 approx. considering the fact that I have only Rs. One Lakh for my entire trip. The price of ticket was indeed a big motivation for moving ahead with my travel plans… …Now I instructed my Gini (Skyscanner.co.in) to get me a good hotel which is in my budget and provide me some exquisite experience at the same time. Giving my fetish for good hotels and that too at a good price, I thought it will be difficult for Gini, but Lo & behold! I had host of hotels, resorts and places of stay at my disposal. I started looking at them one by one, now it was my turn to be confused. So I began the daunting task of screening the hotels, but on Skyscanner this journey was smooth beyond my imagination. The hotels listed had all the details including price details. In no time, I zeroed in to a hotel which looked quite impressive and was in my budget too…& that was Garden View Cottage, in Ubud which is located in the cool lush Central Highlands of Bali famed for its arts and crafts. Just south of Ubud, buffered by the Monkey Forest Sanctuary in the enchanting village of Nyuh Kuning Garden View looks like a haven of peace and harmony. Surrounded by shimmering fields edged by greenful gardens and home of refreshing “Mango Blue” Swimming pool looks like ‘the’ place for my stay in Bali. The package cost was unbelievable, Rs. 26,000 for entire six days, what a deal – incredible! I am delighted to the core. Though a true-blue Mumbaikar, and a regular user of public transport, I don’t use public transport ever for any of my trips, as venture out for the much needed break from using public transport. Now it was time for me to check on Car rentals which I find most expensive part in any trip be it in India or abroad. This will cost me around Rs. 6000 maximum, this way it accommodates my husband’s flight ticket too and big budget for shopping for my home and my darling daughter Tanyaa and her host of sisters & friends.

A truly Malaysian cultural journey through a tropical, hilly and demanding terrain…read complete account here before setting out for this adventure in Langkawi, Malaysia. It is a sporty and adventurous year for Malaysia. The country hosted the Ironman 70.3 Putrajaya version in April this year and will be holding the Ironman Malaysia in Langkawi on September 27, 2014. The event is presented by a collaboration of World Triathlon Council. Ironman Malaysia is one of 32 qualifying races on the global Ironman circuit that culminates with the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii each October. Professional athletes will be competing for a total prize of US$40,000 (RM127, 000) for Ironman Malaysia. “Ironman Malaysia is a great platform for athletes to showcase their talent and energy. Malaysia, especially Langkawi, being an ideal location for adventure sports as well as scenic beauty is an idyllic venue for Ironman Malaysia,” says, Mr. Manoharan Periasamy, Director, Tourism Malaysia, India. The name “Ironman Triathlon” is also associated with the original Ironman triathlon which is now the Ironman World Championship. Held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, the world championship has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978 and is preceded by a series of qualifying Ironman events. Ironman World Championships has become known for its gruelling length, harsh race conditions, and Emmy Award winning television coverage. Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board, popularly known as Tourism Malaysia, was established to promote Malaysia as a top-of-mind tourist destination showcasing Malaysia’s unique wonders, attractions and cultures; develop domestic tourism and enhance Malaysia’s share of the market for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE). Tourism Malaysia’s objective is to promote Malaysia as an outstanding tourist destination and make the tourism industry a major contributor to the socio-economic development of the nation. In India, Tourism Malaysia offices are conveniently located in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. In 2014, Malaysia celebrates its fourth VISIT MALAYSIA YEAR (VMY) with the theme “Celebrating 1Malaysia Truly Asia”. The VMY 2014 promotional campaign has started this year with a series of year-long special events and activities leading to VMY 2014. It will contribute to the Government’s target to receive 36 million tourist arrivals and RM168 billion in receipts by 2020, as outlined in the Malaysia Tourism Transformation Plan (MTTP) 2020. Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C. – The Lincoln Memorial not only celebrates the life of the 16th president through a striking structure and interactive museum, but also carries his message of peace following the devastation of the Civil War. The words of his second inaugural address, carved into marble on the walls of the monument, would be a worthwhile plea to any of today’s war zones: “With malice toward none; with charity for all … let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan – to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nation” USS Missouri, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii – A battleship seems like an odd place to celebrate peace, but it was on the deck of the USS Missouri where the Japanese and Allies signed the peace treaty to end World War II on Sept. 2, 1945. Now docked in Pearl Harbor, where the war began for the U.S., the massive USS Missouri is open for guided tours of the inner workings of the ship, its history, and the very spot where the war formally ended. As Gen. Douglas MacArthur said at the time, “Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve it always. These proceedings are closed!” Amsterdam Hilton, Netherlands – On a lighter note, John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s ” bed-in for peace ” took place in a suite at the Amsterdam Hilton in 1969. Part of their year was immortalized in the song ” Ballad of John and Yoko .” Their protest/performance art project certainly didn’t end the war in Vietnam or anyplace else, but it was a noteworthy effort. You can actually stay in the same suite they used, now updated and full of Beatles memorabilia and a nice sound system, where you can put John’s “Give Peace a Chance” on auto-play. If you can’t make it to Amsterdam, you can also stay in the suite in Montreal’s Fairmont. The Queen Elizabeth where John and Yoko staged a second “bed-in” and wrote and recorded peace anthem. The Wall for Peace, Paris – This relatively unknown monument to peace sits in Champs des Mars within view of the Eiffel Tower. The 50-foot long, 30-foot high wall of steel and etched glass contains the word “peace” inscribed in 32 languages in its translucent surface. Inspired by the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the Wall for Peace also has a series of nooks where visitors can place their own messages of peace. Originally meant to be installed for just a three-month exhibit, the wall has stood in the park since 2000, showing that even here in a park dedicated to the god of war, peace has some staying power. Hiroshima Peace Memorial, Japan – Suffering the devastation of an atomic attack tends to make one focused on peace, and this moving memorial near ground zero of the August 1945 bombing is a scenic and thought-provoking spot. The stark steel-and-concrete skeleton of the Genbaku Dome was one of the few structures left standing after the bombing, and it has been preserved and converted into a museum surrounded by cherry tree-filled Peace Memorial Park . The museum’s exhibits displaying the horrors of war finish with a wall of messages for peace from the humble, the famous, and the famously humble Mother Theresa, who wrote, “Let us love one another … so that the terrible evil that had brought so much suffering to Hiroshima may never happen again.” The Peace Palace, The Hague, Netherlands – Funded by American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and constructed in 1912, the Peace Palace was inspired by The Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907. The conferences were meant to promote world peace and reduce the savagery of war. It didn’t work, as World War I began in Belgium a year after the palace was dedicated. But the war ended, and the palace still remains, now housing the International Court of Justice (which tries war criminals), the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the Peace Palace Library. They’re trying. The scenic grounds of the palace host temporary and permanent peace exhibits, and The Hague (“International City of Peace and Justice”) has citywide celebrations to commemorate the United Nations Peace Day on September 21. National Peacekeeping Monument, Ottawa, Canada – Only in polite Canada could you have a national monument dedicated to “reconciliation.” The Peacekeeping Monument, across from the Peace Tower in the capital complex in Ottawa, commemorates the service of more than 110,000 Canadians who have been part of United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world. It includes a quote by former Canadian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Lester Pearson (whose government also introduced universal health care and abolished the death penalty): “We need action not only to end the fighting, but to make the peace.” Palace of Versailles, France -The 1919 Treaty of Versailles has been blamed as a root cause for World War II as well as for the current mess in the Middle East, but it at least did formally mark the end of World War I, granting at least a temporary peace to a weary continent. Visitors to Versailles can now walk through the Hall of Mirrors , where politicians from around the world gathered for the ceremony, and see the Louis XV desk where the document was signed. Even amid heavy summer crowds of visitors to Versailles, you can still find some peace and quiet walking through the palace’s extensive gardens. The beautiful thing about Scotland (other than the scenery of course) is that it is so small that most things are within driving (or boating) distance. So, whether you are planning a road trip around the country, or just fancy a break from the city, there are plenty of opportunities to see some gorgeous views. Skyscanner reveal 11 of the most beautiful places in Scotland. Travelknots highly recommend Road trips by Skyscanner.com. Courtesy: Skyscanner.com Red Fort is witness to the dawn of August 15, 1947 when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, First PM of Independent India made the historical speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Delhi and since then it has been the permanent venue for the big speech i.e. Independence day address to citizens of free India. The Red Fort stood for the sovereign authority of the Mughal badshah, even when actual control of the territories had passed to others. For independent India, the Red Fort came to epitomise the sovereignty of Delhi and, by extension, the unity of India. The Red Fort is an iconic symbol of India. On Independence Day, the prime minister hoists the national flag at the main gate of the fort and delivers a nationally-broadcast speech from its ramparts. This year’s Independence Day evoked the keen interest not only amongst Indian citizens but Indians all over the world, head of states, diplomats…alike! After all it was first address of newly elected Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi from ramparts of Red Fort on August 15, 2014. Excitement was palpable amidst people who had gathered at Red Fort to get the glimpse of Tri Colour unfurled by Mr Modi and his eagerly awaited speech. Not just India but the whole world was keen to know the mind of the first Indian PM born after Indian independence. This was reflected by the fact that the MEA was pleasantly surprised as it was inundated by requests for passes from an unprecedented large number of Heads of Foreign Missions posted in Delhi. Normally, out of the 153 Foreign Missions in New Delhi, just about 50-60 Missions approach the MEA for passes to attend the Independence Day ceremony at Red Fort. But this time the MEA received requests for passes from a record number 150 diplomatic missions. Given the enormous interest shown by foreign diplomatic missions, the MEA had to stretch itself further and made arrangements for simultaneous English translation for the benefit of the foreign diplomatic corps, yet another first. Yet, there was one facet of national life that has defied the intrusions of the new Republic: Popular memory. Despite many attempts to impose some order into India’s myriad past, there remains a fundamental gulf between ‘history’ and memory. The sanitised version sees Independence as a seamless journey from darkness to light. But that’s not how most Indians recall narrations of the past by grandparents and elders. & thus making the Red Fort even more significant. Anybody who has been to Delhi or has lived in Delhi has not missed an opportunity to visit Red Fort and I am sure has great memories attached to his visit. Besides political significance which Red Fort enjoys, it has special significance as historical monument, UNESCO heritage site and tourist destination. It has been a mute witness to various political and historical event which unfurled in Delhi. The Red Fort was the residence of the Mughal emperors of India for nearly 200 years, until 1857. It is located in the centre of Delhi and houses a number of museums. In addition to accommodating the emperors and their households, it was the ceremonial and political centre of Mughal government and the setting for events critically impacting the region. Undoubtedly it has great significance for tourists visiting Delhi not just from India but across the globe to visit Red Fort which stands on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road, close to Jama Masjid and extends upto Chandani Chowk. It is famous for its light and sound show which is being held at 7:30 3every evening and is a big draw amidst tourists. The long and short of story is that we all love visiting Red Fort – Old generations, New generations. It is a must visit on our itinery. I have some very special memories attached to it when I used to go there for Independence Day celebration with my father to watch Mrs. Indira Gandhi, PM of India who exuded great power then, what a delight it was to watch her speech from ramparts of Red Fort. Not only this, after this we would move to Nai Sarak to pick up some lovely second hand books which I loved to read. Cherish memories of my father who is no more…and his frequent visits to Red Fort on some pretext or the other. Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort in 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed in 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort’s boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort. The fortress-palace was a focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. It’s planning and aesthetics represent the zenith of Mughal creativity prevailing during Shah Jahan’s reign. His successor Aurangzeb added the Pearl Mosque to the emperor’s private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous. After witnessing rise and fall of many Mughal emperors, 1911 saw the visit of the British king and queen for the Delhi Durbar. In preparation of the visit, some buildings were restored. The Red Fort Archaeological Museum was also moved from the drum house to the Mumtaz Mahal. With the Salimgarh Fort, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered puja at the famous 5th century Pashupatinath temple in Nepal on last Monday of Shravan. Modi was at the temple of Lord Shiva for about 45 minutes on a day which is considered pious as it was a Monday that falls in the month of ‘Shravan’. Though I have always been curious about this temple since the time I had seen Devanand’s movie dum maro dum as a child which was extensively shot in Kathmandu and particularly in the temple. Since then it has been on my travel wish list. Now there is a revived interest in the Hindu shrine owing to Modiji’s visit to Nepal and Pashupati Nath temple. Pashupatinath Temple, with its astonishing architectural beauty, stands as a symbol of faith, religion, culture and tradition. Regarded as the most sacred temple of Hindu Lord Shiva in the world, Pashupatinath Temple’s existence dates back to 400 A.D. The richly-ornamented pagoda houses the sacred linga or phallic symbol of Lord Shiva. Thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to pay homage to this temple, that is also known as ‘The Temple of Living Beings’. The temple is UNESCO listed World Heritage Site and its unique Features include  only four priests, appointed by the King, can touch the idol of Lord Shiva. The priests are always from south India and it is believed that this tradition have been started by Sage Shankaracharaya in 6th century. Its architecture is worth talking home about, the two level roofs of the temple are embellished with gold and the four main doors are adorned with silver.  The temple is famous for its awe-inspiring and astounding pagoda architecture. The western door has a statue of a large Bull, Nandi, is ornamented in gold. This black stone idol, about 6 ft in height and circumference, adds to the beauty and charisma of the temple. The present architectural nature of Pashupatinath temple came into existence as a result of renovation by Queen Gangadevi during the reign of Shivasimha Malla (1578-1620 AD). The Hindu temple is located on the banks of the Bagmati River in Deopatan, a village 3 km northwest of Kathmandu. It is dedicated to a manifestation of Shiva called Pashupati (Lord of Animals). It attracts thousands of pilgrims each year, mostly from India. There are a lot of Indian pujaris at the temple. There is a tradition of keeping four priests and one chief priest at the temple from among the Bramhins of south India for centuries. According to legend, the temple was constructed by Pashupreksha of the Somadeva Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, but the first historical records date from the 13th century. Pashupati was a tutelary deity of the ancient rulers of the Kathmandu Valley; in 605 AD, Amshuvarman considered himself favored by his touching of the god’s feet. By the later Middle Ages, many imitations of the temple had been built, such as in Bhaktapur (1480), Lalitpur (1566) and Benares (early 19th century). The original temple was destroyed several times until it was given its present form under King Bhupalendra Malla in 1697. According to a legend, especially the Nepalamahatmya and the Himavatkhanda, the Hindu god Shiva once fled from the other gods in Varanasi to Mrigasthali, the forest on the opposite bank of the Bagmati River from the temple. There, in the form of a gazelle, he slept. When the gods discovered him there and tried to bring him back to Varanasi, he leapt across the river to the opposite bank, where one of his horns broke into four pieces. After this, Shiva became manifest as Pashupati (Lord of Animals) in a four-face (chaturmukha) linga. Pashupati area is regarded as one of the most important places of pilgrimages for the followers of Hinduism. Thousands of devotees from within and outside the country come to pay homage to Pashupatinath every day. And on special occasions like Ekadasi, Sankranti, Mahashivratri, Teej Akshaya, Rakshabandhan, Grahana (eclipse), Poornima (Full moon day) the whole atmosphere turns festive and mirthful as people congregate here in a far greater number. During the Shivaratri (also spelled Shivratri) festival Pashupatinath temple is lit with ghee lamps throughout the night and the temple remains open all night. Thousands of devotees take ritual baths in the Bagmati river on the day of the festival and observe a fast for the whole day. Hundreds of sadhus (sages) from different parts of Nepal and India come here on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. In August, during the Teej festival, thousands of women visit the temple to bathe in the holy waters of the Bagmati River. Because this ritual is meant to bring a long and happy marriage, many women dress in red saris, which are traditionally worn for wedding ceremonies. Full moon and New moon days are also considered auspicious to visit the temple. You should also include this on your travel wish list.

It is considered the cultural center of Japan with 1,600 Buddhist temples, four hundred Shinto shrines, palaces, gardens and architectural treasures. Kyoto was spared during the fire bombing of World War II, making it the only large Japanese city that still has an abundance of pre-war buildings and a popular destination for tourists. The city has many small factories run by artisans who produce traditional Japanese crafts. Kyoto's kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center for kimono manufacturing. Kyoto is known as one of the academic centers of Japan, and is home to 37 institutions of higher education, including Kyoto University. Today the city has a population of close to 1.5 million and is the capital of Kyoto Prefecture, as well as a major part of the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto metropolitan area. Though archaeological evidence places the first human settlement on the islands of Japan to approximately 10,000 B.C.E., relatively little is known about human activity in the area before the sixth century C.E. During the eighth century, the powerful Buddhist clergy began to interfere in the affairs of the Imperial government, and the emperor chose to relocate the capital to a region far from the Buddhist influence. The new city, Heiankyō (平安京　, ""Heian capital"") became the seat of Japan's imperial court in 794. Later, the city was renamed Kyoto (""capital city""). Kyoto remained Japan's capital until the transfer of the government to Edo (now Tokyo) in 1868 at the time of the Imperial Restoration (some Japanese still consider it to be the legal capital). After Edo was renamed Tokyo, (meaning ""Eastern Capital""), Kyoto was known for a short time as Saikyo (西京, Saikyō, ""Western Capital""). In 1945, at the end of World War II, the Target Committee of the United States Manhattan Project placed Kyoto at the top of the list of targets for the dropping of the atomic bomb. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Stimson adamantly refused to bomb Kyoto because it ""was the ancient capital of Japan, a historical city, and one that was of great religious significance to the Japanese."" He had visited the city several times and was ""very much impressed by its ancient culture."" Kyoto was removed from the list and its architectural treasures were preserved. Kyoto is the only large Japanese city that still has an abundance of prewar buildings, such as machiya (traditional townhouses). However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the controversial Kyoto Station complex. Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. Kyoto is located on the middle-western portion of the island of Honshū. Surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, Kyoto is famous for its stifling summer nights with no breezes. Kyoto sits above a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Large scale urbanization has reduced the amount of rain draining into the table and wells across the area are drying up at an increasing rate. As of 2005, the city had an estimated population of 1,474,764 and a population density of 1,775 persons per square kilometer. The total area is 827.9 square kilometers. The original city (the modern-day wards of Nakagyō, Shimogyō-ku and Kamigyō) was laid out in a grid pattern, modeled after the ancient Chinese capital during the Tang Dynasty, Changan, (present-day Xi'an), in accordance with traditional Chinese geomancy, with the Imperial Palace facing south. The Imperial Palace's southward orientation is also the reason why Sakyō-ku (the ""Left Capital"") is in the east, Ukyō-ku (the ""Right Capital"") is in the west. Today, the main business district is located in the south and center of town, with the less populated northern area retaining more vegetation. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names (Japanese streets typically are not named). Kyoto has eleven wards (ku). The main hall of Kiyomizu-dera is notable for its vast veranda, supported by hundreds of pillars, which juts out over the hillside and offers impressive views of the city. The expression ""to jump off the stage at Kiyomizu"" (「清水の舞台から飛び降りる」) refers to an Edo period tradition that held that, if one were to survive jumping from the stage, one's wish would be granted. Beneath the main hall is the waterfall Otowa-no-taki, where three channels of water, which is believed to have therapeutic properties and confer health, longevity, and success in studies on anyone who imbibes them, drop into a pond. The temple complex contains several other shrines, notably Jishu-jinja, including Okuninushino-Mikoto, a god of love and ""good matches."" Jishu-jinja possesses a pair of ""love stones"" placed 18 meters apart, which lonely visitors attempt to walk between with their eyes closed. Success in reaching the other stone, eyes closed, is taken as a presage that the pilgrim will find love. Kinkaku-ji (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion Temple), the informal name of Rokuon-ji (鹿苑寺, “Deer Garden Temple”), was originally built in 1397 as a retirement villa for Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. His son converted the building into a Zen temple of the Rinzai school. The temple was burned down several times during the Ōnin War. The entire pavilion except the basement floor is covered with pure gold leaf. The pavilion functions as a shariden, housing relics of the Buddha. On the roof of the pavilion is a golden fenghuang or ""Chinese phoenix."" The temple was burned down in 1950 by a mentally disturbed monk; the present structure dates from 1955, and restoration of the gold leaf and lacquer coatings was completed in 1987. Ginkaku-ji ( 銀閣寺), the ""Temple of the Silver Pavilion,"" is a Buddhist temple in the Higashiyama District of Kyoto. The temple's official name is Jishō-ji (慈照寺). It was built in 1474 by the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who sought to emulate the golden Kinkaku-ji commissioned by his grandfather Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. The Kannon hall, known as Ginkaku, the Silver Pavilion, was originally to be covered in silver, but construction was halted due to the increasing severity of the Ōnin War, which broke out in 1467, and the silver covering never placed on the pavilion. The building, originally intended to be a monument to ostentation, is now taken as an example of Japanese refinement and restraint. Like Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji was originally built to serve as a place of rest and solitude for the Shogun. It is said Ashikaga Yoshimasa sat in the pavilion, contemplating the calm and beauty of the gardens as the Ōnin War worsened and Kyoto was burned to the ground. In 1485, Yoshimasa became a Zen Buddhist monk, and after his death the villa became a Buddhist temple, renamed Jishō-ji. In addition to that building, the temple features wooded grounds covered with a variety of mosses, and a Japanese garden, supposedly designed by the great landscape artist Soami. The rock and sand garden of Ginkaku-ji is particularly famous, and a pile of sand said to symbolize Mount Fuji has now come to be a part of the garden. The Heian Jingū (平安神宮) is a Shinto shrine. The torii before the main gate is one of the largest in Japan, and the main building, or shaden (社殿), is designed to imitate the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It was built in 1895 for the 1,100th anniversary of the establishment of Heiankyō (the old name of Kyoto). The shrine is dedicated to Emperor Kammu, who moved the capital to Heian and Emperor Kōmei, the last before Emperor Meiji moved the capital to Tokyo. Ryōan-ji (Shinjitai, 竜安寺; Kyūjitai, 龍安寺, The Temple of the Peaceful Dragon) is a Zen temple located in northwest Kyoto. Belonging to the Myōshinji school of the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism, the temple is famous for its karesansui (dry landscape) rock garden, thought to have been built in the late 1400s. The garden consists of raked gravel and fifteen moss-covered boulders, which are placed so that, when looking at the garden from any angle (other than from above) only fourteen of the boulders are visible at one time. It is traditionally said that only through attaining enlightenment would one be able to view the fifteenth boulder. Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyōto Gosho, 京都御所) was the Imperial Palace of Japan for much of its history, from the Heian Period, when the Imperial capital was moved from Nara to Heian-kyo (平安京), (Kyoto), until the Meiji Restoration, when the capital was moved to Tokyo. The Taisho and Showa Emperors had their coronation ceremonies at Kyōto Gosho. Since it was first built in 794, the palace has been destroyed and rebuilt eight times, six of them during the 250-year-long peace of the Edo period. The version currently standing was completed in 1855, the Heian period architecture and style reproduced perfectly. The main gate on the front, south, side of the palace has a cypress-wood roof, and is supported by four pillars. On either side of it trees were planted, which would become very famous and sacred, a cherry (sakura) on the left, and a tachibana tree on the right. This gate was used on the rare occasions by the emperor to welcome a foreign diplomat or dignitary, as well as for many other important ceremonies of the state. The Katsura Imperial Villa (桂離宮, Katsura Rikyū), or Katsura Detached Palace, one of Japan's most important large-scale cultural treasures, is a villa with associated gardens and outbuildings in the western suburbs of Kyoto. Its gardens are masterpieces of Japanese gardening, and the buildings are one of the greatest achievements of Japanese architecture. The Shūgaku-in was originally constructed 1655 – 1659 by the retired Emperor Go-Mizunoo. The Upper Garden features a large artificial pond, created by building an earthen dam across a ravine; the pond contains a number of small islands. Unlike the typical Japanese garden, it is a very large stroll garden, making extensive use of the technique of ""borrowed scenery."" After Go-Mizunoo's death, his daughter Princess Mitsuko became a nun, and established another temple there, the Ryinku-ji, in what later became the Middle Garden. Tenryū-ji (天龍寺), more formally known as Tenryū Shiseizen-ji (天龍資聖禅寺), located in Susukinobaba-chō, Ukyō Ward, is the head temple of the Tenryū sect of Rinzai Zen Buddhism. The temple was founded by Ashikaga Takauji, primarily to venerate Gautama Buddha, and its first chief priest was Musō Soseki. The temple is ranked as the most important (Rinzai) Zen temple in Kyoto. In the early Heian period, Empress Tachibana no Kachiko, wife of Emperor Saga, founded a temple called Danrin-ji (檀林寺) on the site of present-day Tenryū-ji. The temple fell into disrepair over the next four hundred years, before, in the mid-thirteenth century, Emperor Gosaga and his son Emperor Kameyama turned the area into an imperial villa they christened ""Kameyama Detatched Palace"" (亀山殿, kameyamadono). The name ""Kameyama,"" which literally means ""turtle mountain,"" was selected due to the shape of Mount Ogura, which lies to the west of Tenryū-ji—it is said to be similar to the shape of a turtle's shell. The palace was converted into a temple at the behest of Ashikaga Takauji, who became shogun in 1338. Ashikaga had opposed the failed Kemmu Restoration initiated by Emperor Go-daigo, who then decreed that Ashikaga should be hunted down and executed. When Emperor Go-daigo passed away, Ashikaga recommended that Zen monk Musō Soseki construct a temple for his memorial service. At one time, the massive grounds (roughly 330,000 square meters) were said to contain some 150 sub-temples, however, the temple was plagued with numerous fires, and all of the original buildings have been destroyed. Most of the buildings seen today are reconstructions from the latter half of the Meiji period. The Kamo Shrines, Kamigamo Jinja (上鴨神社),  and Shimogamo Jinja (下鴨神社) are a pair of Shinto shrines, dedicated to Kamo Wake-ikazuchi, the kami of thunder, and feature prominently in the Aoi Festival, which occurs in May and involves a procession between the two shrines, horse races, and archery. Kamigamo Shrine, the “higher” or “upper” Kamo Shrine, dating most likely to the seventh century, is famous for its Haiden hall, rebuilt in 1628. A number of priests' residences are situated on its grounds. Its two large conical sand mounds memorialize the holy trees that once served to welcome spirits. The pagoda of Tō-ji stands 57 meters high, and is the tallest wooden tower in Japan. It dates from the Edo period, when it was rebuilt by order of the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu. The pagoda has been, and continues to be, a symbol of Kyoto. On the 21st of each month, a famous flea market is held on the Tō-ji temple grounds. This market is popularly called Kōbō-san, in honor of Kōbō Daishi, who died on March 21. Daigo-ji (醍醐寺) is a Shingon Buddhist temple in Fushimi-ku. The main image (honzon) is Yakushi. Rigen-daishi (Shōbō) founded the temple in 874. More than seven centuries later, Toyotomi Hideyoshi held a famous cherry-blossom viewing party there. Saihō-ji (西芳寺), a Rinzai Zen Buddhist temple famed for its moss garden, is commonly referred to as ""Koke-dera"" (苔寺) meaning ""moss temple,"" and is also known as ""Kōinzan Saihō-ji"" (洪隠山西芳寺). According to temple legend, Saihō-ji was constructed during the Nara period by Gyōki, on the location of one of Prince Shōtoku's former retreats. The temple first operated as a Hossō temple dedicated to Amitabha, and was known as ""Saihō-ji"" (西方寺) a homophone of the current name. The name was selected because Amitabha is the primary buddha of Pure Land Buddhism, known in Japanese as ""Saihō Gokuraku Jōdo"" (西方 極楽浄土). Legend states that such famous Japanese monks as Kūkai and Hōnen later served as the chief priests of the temple. Although the veracity of these legends is questionable, it is believed that such a predecessor to the current temple did, in fact, exist. Over time, the temple fell into disrepair, and in 1339, the chief priest of the nearby Matsunoo Shrine, Fujiwara Chikahide, summoned the famous Japanese gardener Musō Soseki to help him revive Saihō-ji as a Zen temple. Saihō-ji was destroyed by fire during the Ōnin War, and twice ravaged by floods during the Edo period, but has since been rebuilt. Ironically, the moss for which the temple is known was not part of Musō's original design. According to French historian François Berthier, the garden's ""islands"" were ""carpeted with white sand"" in the fourteenth century. The moss came much later, of its own accord during the Meiji era (1860-1912), when the monastery lacked sufficient funds for upkeep.[2] Hongan-ji (本願寺, temple of the original vow) is the name of a number of Buddhist temples through Japan's history. However, it refers primarily to a pair of temples, which were once one, in Kyoto. The Hongan-ji was established as a temple in 1321, on the site of the Otani Mausoleum, where Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land) sect was buried. Kakunyo became the first chief priest of the Hongan-ji, and dedicated it to the worship of Amida Buddha. The Hongan-ji first gained power and importance in the fifteenth century, when Rennyo became its eighth chief priest. However, the Tendai sect, based on Mount Hiei, saw this expansion as a threat and attacked the Hongan-ji three times with their army of sohei (warrior monks). Rennyo fled to Yoshizaki, Fukui where he founded the Ikko sect. During the Sengoku period, fearing the power of the monks of the Hongan-ji, Oda Nobunaga tried to destroy it. For ten years, he laid siege to the Ishiyama Hongan-ji in Osaka, one of the two primary temple fortresses of the Ikko sect.[3] In 1602, just after Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun, he decreed that the Hongan-ji be split in two. Kyonyo, the twelfth chief priest of Hongan-ji became the first of the Higashi Honganji (or, “The Eastern Temple of the Original Vow”), while Junyo became chief priest of the Nishi Honganji (or, “The Western Temple of the Original Vow”).[3] During the Meiji Restoration in the 1860s, the government set down new guidelines for the management of religious organizations and an organization called Shinshu Otani was put in control of the Higashi Hongan-ji. In 1987, the temple was renamed ""Shinshu Honbyo,"" or New Buddhist Mausoleum, and its purpose reverted to that of a mausoleum. The Nishi Hongan-ji (西本願寺), like the Higashi Hongan-ji, features a huge Goei-do　 (御影堂), founder's hall and a smaller Amida-do (阿弥陀堂), or Buddha hall, housing an image of the Amida Buddha. It also contains two Noh stages, one of which claims to be the oldest in existence, and the Kokei no Niwa (虎渓の庭) gardens. The Goei-do at Higashi Hongan-ji dates from 1895 and vies with a number of other structures for the claim of largest wooden building in the world. Other notable sites in and around Kyoto include Kōzan-ji, the Nijo Castle, Arashiyama and its picturesque lake, the Gion and Pontochō geisha quarters, the Philosopher's Walk (a favorite path of philosopher Kitaro Nishida), and the canals which line some of the older streets. The ""Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto"" are listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The city's industry is mainly comprised of small factories, most of which are run by artisans who produce traditional Japanese crafts. Kyoto's kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center for kimono manufacturing. These businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as traditional goods are in less demand. Kyoto's only sizable heavy industry is electronics: the city is home to the headquarters of Nintendo, as well as the headquarters of OMRON, Kyocera (Kyoto Ceramic) and Murata Machinery. The apparel giant Wacoal also operates in Kyoto. However, the growth of high-tech industry has not compensated for the decline in traditional industry, and as a result, Kyoto's total manufacturing output has declined relative to other cities in Japan. The Toei Uzumasa Eigamura (also known as Kyoto Studio Park and Toei Movie Land) is called the ""Hollywood of Japan.""[4] Like Universal Studios, Eigamura is a film set and theme park in one, and many Japanese period movies were shot here. It features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings including the old Nihonbashi Bridge, a traditional court house, a Meiji period police box and part of the former Yoshiwara red light district, which are used as settings for period movies and television dramas. Occasionally an actual film shooting takes place, and park visitors are welcome to observe the action. Kyoto is known as one of the academic centers of Japan, and is home to 37 institutions of higher education. The three largest and best-known local universities are Doshisha University, Kyoto University, and Ritsumeikan University. Kyoto University is considered to be one of the top universities in Japan, boasting several Nobel laureates such as Yukawa Hideki. Kyoto also has a unique higher education network called the Consortium of Universities in Kyoto, which consists of three national, five public (prefectural and municipal), and 41 private universities, as well as the city and four other organizations. The consortium does not offer a degree; hence is not a federal body like University of London, but offers the courses as part of a degree at participating universities. The city transportation is centered around Kyoto Station (京都駅, Kyoto-eki). The station is the second largest in Japan and holds a shopping mall, hotel, movie theater, Isetan department store, and several local government facilities under one fifteen-story roof. The Tokaido Shinkansen Line (see below) as well as all local rail lines connect here. For many travelers it is a hub of travel and a good place to catch all the buses the city has to offer. Kyoto's municipal bus network and subway system are extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take taxis or tour buses. Bicycles are an important form of personal transportation in the city, and are considered a part of Kyoto's urban identity. The geography and scale of the city are such that the city may be easily navigated on a bicycle. In soccer, Kyoto is represented by Kyoto Purple Sanga who rose to J. League's Division 1 in 2005. Because of the popularity of the nearby Hanshin Tigers, Kyoto has never had a team in Japanese professional baseball, though the Tigers play several neutral-site games at Kyoto's Nishi Kyogoku stadium every year, but Kyoto's high school baseball teams are strong.

It is a proportionality factor that relates energy scales and temperature scales in several equations. P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, and T is temperature. Rearranging the equation, you can solve for R: E is the cell potential, E0 is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of mole of electrons exchanged, F is Faraday's constant, and Q is the reaction quotient. The gas constant is equivalent to the Boltzmann constant, just expressed in units of energy per temperature per mole, while the Boltzmann constant is given in terms of energy per temperature per particle. From a physical standpoint, the gas constant is a proportionality constant that related the energy scale to the temperature scale for a mole of particles at a given temperature. Units for the gas constant vary, depending on other units used in the equation. The value of the gas constant 'R' depends on the units used for pressure, volume and temperature. Prior to 2019, these were common values for the gas constant. In 2019, the SI base units were redefined. Both Avogadro's number and the Boltzmann constant were given exact numerical values. As a consequence, the gas constant also now has an exact value: 8.31446261815324 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. Because of the relatively recent definition change, use care when comparing calculations prior to 2019 because the values for R are slightly different before and after the redefinition. Some people assume the symbol R is used for the gas constant in honor of the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault, who performed experiments that were first used to determine the constant. However, it's unclear whether his name is the true origin of the convention used to denote the constant. A related factor is the specific gas constant or individual gas constant. This may be indicated by R or Rgas. It is the universal gas constant divided by the molar mass (M) of a pure gas or mixture. This constant is specific to the particular gas or mixture (hence its name), while the universal gas constant is the same for an ideal gas. The United States government uses a defined value of R, indicated by R*, in its definition of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere. Agencies using R* include NASA, NOAA, and the USAF. By definition, R* is exactly 8.31432×103 N⋅m⋅kmol−1⋅K−1 or 8.31432 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. While this gas constant value is inconsistent with the Boltzmann constant and Avogadro constant, the discrepancy is not huge. It does deviate slightly from the ISO value of R for calculating pressure as a function of altitude.

where does brown fit in the color spectrum,"In terms of the visible spectrum, ""brown"" refers to high wavelength (low frequency) hues, yellow, orange, or red, in combination with low luminance or saturation. Since brown may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum, composite adjectives are used such as red brown, yellowish brown, dark brown or light brown.","One of the first brown pigments was umber, a dark brown clay that contains iron and manganese oxides. The word brown comes from Old English “brún,” used for any dusky or dark shade of color. Brown represents earthiness. While brown might be considered a little dull compared to the other colors, brown also represents simplicity, health, and dependability. UPS (United Parcel Service) long ago adopted brown as its corporate color, and companies today often use brown paper to denote a natural product. Although brown may not be as glamorous as other colors, its importance in painting is highly recognized by artists, who use browns such as burnt sienna and burnt umber to create subtle gradations from light to dark. The color brown therefore enables artists to create a sense of realism on the canvas. Humanity had pure brown pigments from the beginning of art. Umber is a natural earth color with many natural (raw umber, raw sienna) and manmade (burnt umber, burnt sienna) variations, providing painters throughout history with many brown shades to satisfy their visual needs. In the 17th century, another natural earth color came into use, namely Van Dyke brown. Although earthy browns were available for artists’ use, in the 18th and 19th centuries European artists commonly used a brown called ""mommia"" that was made from corpses. Egyptian mummies were exhumed and processed for commercial use as artist paint. Another odd source of the color brown was the cuttlefish, whose secretions of dark ink were used to create sepia dye. These days, artificial dyes have replaced cuttlefish ink for sepia. Brown may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum because it refers to more hues (yellow, orange, or red) in combination with low luminance or saturation. Its shades are named using composite adjectives, such as red brown, yellowish brown, dark brown, and so forth. Browns can be made from primary colors, mixing blue with yellow to get green and then, mixing green with red. Browns can also be made simply by mixing orange or red color with a bit of black paint. Timeline of brown pigments. Top, Rembrandt, History Painting, 1626, Leiden, Stedelijk Museum. Middle, detail. Bottom, cross-section. Ground is the term describing the layer applied to the support as a preparation for painting. In early panel paintings, the ground consisted of inert white filler (chalk or gesso (mineral gypsum)) bound with animal skin glue. In the early 16th century, artists began to color their grounds dark brown because doing so made it possible to execute a painting more rapidly and freely. Dark brown grounds were also exploited in the composition of a painting, either by leaving parts exposed, as can be seen in the detail of the shaded part along the forehead and nose, where the brown ground is partly visible. The evolution was complete by the 17th century, when it became unusual to paint onto a white surface. Rembrandt used carbon black as the main tinting pigment for the ground layer. In this cross-section from the top part of the white sash of the man on the extreme left of the painting, we can see from bottom to top the brown colored chalk and glue ground followed by a bit brighter second thin ground. Next, another dark mixture was used for the under painting and finally the lead white layer of the sash. Brown and orange are more closely related than you might have imagined. The perceived color depends upon which white a color is compared with. This is particularly true for tertiary colors like brown, which is perceived only in the presence of a brighter color contrast; otherwise it looks orange. Orange is still perceived as such, regardless of the general illumination level. Look at these two disks in the image. They are objectively identical, but the one in a brighter light looks brown, while the one in the shadow looks orange. The indefinable nature of brown could be the reason why Japanese do not have a specific word for it but refer to brown with names such as “tea-color"" and ""fallen-leaf.”","Xsmn 27/05/22Praesent vestibulum molestie lacus.

However, we cannot deny that a pretty face makes us much more attractive. Beautiful skin always makes you confident even when you don’t apply makeup. Therefore, the question is how to get a beautiful face skin? The thing that women fear most may be the effect of aging on their facial skin. When it comes to signs of aging, you usually think of wrinkles and saggy skin. However, in fact, aging spots which are one of the most common signs of skin aging occur when you are 40 years old or earlier if you are frequently exposed to the sun. Nowadays, the term that companies working in the field of skin care call this skin aging phenomenon is dark spots. These dark spots are a common skin condition, but not many of us really understand them. Are you worried about this condition? Don’t worry! The following article will help you. If you want to have perfect facial skin, apply the home remedies for dark spots introduced below. You can do natural treatments at home because they are very simple. Do not think that inexpensive measures are not effective because you will be surprised at the results they bring to your facial skin. However, before that, let’s learn some basic information about dark spots to get the best view on them! Ephelides are dark spots that often appear in people with thin and white skin. Ephelides may also appear on face skin due to genetic factors or excessive sun exposure. Characteristics of the ephelides are well demarcated, which are round or irregularly shaped spots of dark or light brown color. They are quite large in size and quite dim in color. Ephelides may fade in winter They’re all here and ready to answer your questions online or by phone. Keep asking questions until you get the answer you need. Lentigines are the medical term for some dark freckles caused by sunburn. Lentigines are dark spots that appear in people with dark skin. Lentigines are discrete hyperintense lesions. The color of lentigines varies from light brown to black. The leading cause of lentigines is excessive exposure to sunlight. Lentigines may fade when you reduce or stop sun exposure. Lentigines are characterized by circular or oval spots. They are 1-5 mm in diameter and have light brown, dark brown, or black. Each of these dark spots is called lentigo simplex. It is very rare due to heredity. Lentigines do not fade in winter. According to experts, to get rid of lentigines is difficult because it depends on the level and area of lentigines, as well as their distribution density. It seems to be more difficult to treat lentigines than ephelides because lentigines have stronger melamine particles, and they are deeply embedded in the dermis. Melasma is one of the factors that make many women unconfident when facing a crowd. Melasma often occurs in a lot of people, even when you are young. Melasma is accompanied by the appearance of the round, small, and dark spots. The color of melasma is yellowish brown, light brown, or dark brown. Melasma often appears into the clusters, distributed mainly on the cheekbones, nose, forehead, and chin. The cause of melasma is the overgrowth of melanin pigments due to sun exposure. If the dark spots of melasma are not treated timely, they will tend to spread and turn into darker spots that become more difficult to treat. Tortoise is red, brown, reddish-brown or black spots that may appear anywhere on the body, especially in the cheek and neck. Tortoise is more common at the age of 55 and over, but sometimes it also occurs in younger people (about 30 years old). Tortoise usually occurs in sun-exposed skin areas such as the face and neck and looks quite similar to melasma. These areas will be hyper-pigment, which leads to discolored skin. People with white skin are more susceptible to tortoise than people with dark skin. Tortoise is not a sign of cancer or any other dermatological illness. It makes women feel sad because it is a sign of skin aging. Tortoise increases in size and gets darker in color over time. Post-inflammatory pigmentation is short-term pigmentation after injury (e.g., heat or fire burn) or inflammatory skin disorder (e.g., infection, dermatitis). These spots have different colors, from pink to red, from brown to black, depending on the color and depth of the color changes. They are similar to small freckles. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation makes the skin dark and shiny or looks like a “new” skin. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation affects people with acne. It is usually caused by cosmetic interventions such as chemical exfoliation. People can get dark spots on the skin after sun exposure or indoor tanning. Body parts that are most exposing to the sun, such as the face, arms, or hands, are most likely to have sunspots. If your family or your relatives have lentigines, the risk you develop lentigines is very high. The treatment of lentigines, in this case, is very difficult. This is also the cause of dark spots on the face in many women, especially in women over the age of 30. Hormonal disorders may be caused by many factors such as irregular menstrual cycle, using antibiotics, birth control pills for a long time, etc. For women from 30 years old and postnatal women, the appearance of dark spots on their face is most likely to be due to hormonal changes and hormonal imbalance. Lowered estrogen levels are responsible for changes in the skin at this stage: wrinkled skin, reduced elasticity, and dark spots, etc. The use of too many types of cosmetics, especially those with toxic substances to whiten skin, will make the skin thin. Therefore, the skin is also easier to catch the sun, creating a good opportunity to burn and have dark spots on the face. Stress: Psychological stress increases the risk of skin problems, especially the appearance of dark spots on the face. Environmental pollution: Poor living environment, dust, toxic substances, etc. may make the dark spots on your face worse. Nutrition: Improper addition of nutrients and vitamins to the skin affects the health of your skin. People whose relatives get melasma or freckles are also likely to have melasma or freckles. Besides, people who regularly work outdoors, often expose to the sun, are also more likely to experience dark spots on the face. In addition, women at the age of 30 and over are also prone to this condition. There, you have discovered some information about dark spots on face. To overcome this condition, many people have come to the beauty salons to recover their facial skin. This takes a lot of money and time.

our common future from one earth to one world summary,"The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. The Brundtland Report claimed that poverty reduces sustainability and accelerates environmental pressures -- creating a need for the balancing between economy and ecology. As such, the Report offered ""(the) analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development"" within such societies (1987: 16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed (and expanded); this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.","“Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. The concept of sustainable development can be traced to 1987 and the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) – commonly known as the Brundtland Commission, named for its Chair, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and its report, Our Common Future. The commission was charged with developing recommendations for paths towards economic and social development that would not achieve short-term economic growth at the expense of long-term environmental and economic stability. The central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of ""sustainable development"" is that of intergenerational equity and the Commission presented the environment as something beyond physicality, to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation. The Brundtland Commission Report recognized that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognized that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialized and industrializing societies existed. As such, the Report offered “[the] analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987: 16).  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brundtland_Commission). The Brundtland Commissioners came from 21 very different nations.  They ended the report by stating: ""In our discussions, we disagreed often on details and priorities. But despite our widely differing backgrounds and varying national and international responsibilities, we were able to agree to the lines along which institutional change must be drawn. We are unanimous in our conviction that the security, well-being, and very survival of the planet depends on such changes, now."" That was over 25 years ago... The work of many involved in sustainable development, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is based on the definitions and frameworks set out by the Brundtland Commission. The GRI has developed protocols for the development of sustainability plans generally and for specific sectors;  and overall, recommends that organizations determine a sustainability strategy to guide their actions internally and with stakeholders.
