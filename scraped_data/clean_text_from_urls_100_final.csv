Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and CARICOM. The country speaks English as its official language. The capital, and its main port, is Kingstown. Its national bird is the Saint Vincent Amazon, an endemic bird of the Saint Vincent island.[3] Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. The Queen does not live in the islands but she is represented in the country by the Governor-General, currently Sir Frederick Ballantyne. Control of the government rests with the elected prime minister and his or her cabinet. The current Prime Minister is Ralph Gonsalves. The country has no formal armed forces, although the police has a Special Service Unit that has a supporting role on the island. The Parliament is unicameral is formed only by the House of Assembly with 21 seats: 15 representatives elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms and 6 appointed senators. The last elections were held on 13 December 2010 and the next will be held in 2015.[1] The island now known as Saint Vincent was originally named Youloumain[4]  by the native Caribs. The Caribs inhabited Saint Vincent before the Europeans arrived, and it is possible still to find Carib artifacts in the island. Christopher Columbus explored in 1498 the main island on Saint Vincent's Day.[5] The Caribs did not allowed Europeans to settle in Saint Vincent until 1719 when some French people came from Martinique and began to grow coffee, tobacco, indigo, cotton and sugar cane with the help of African slaves. In 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, France gave control of Saint Vincent to Britain; France took the island again in 1779, but the British then regained Saint Vincent under the Treaty of Versailles (1783). In 1834 slavery was abolished and people from the Portuguese island of Madeira and from India came to work as agricultural workers.[5] In 1871 the group of islands became part of the Windward Islands Colony and in 1956 a member of the Federation of the Windward Islands. In 1958 Saint Vincent joined the Federation of the West Indies and in 1969 it got full internal self-government. Finally in 1979 it became an Independent Sovereign State within the Commonwealt.[5] The estimated population in 2003 was 103,220. The population density is 265 persons per square kilometre. The ethnic composition was 66% Black, 19% Mixed, 6.0% East Indian, 4.0% European (mainly Portuguese), 2.0% Carib Amerindian, 3.0% others.[1] The official language of the islands is English but most people use the Vicentian Creole English.[6] The people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was 75% Protestant (47% Anglicans, 28% Methodists), 13% Catholics, 12% other (Hindu, Seventh-Day Adventists, other Protestant).[1] Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a group of islands of the Caribbean Sea. It lies to the west of Barbados, south of Saint Lucia and north of Grenada in the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. There are 32 islands and cays, including the main island of Saint Vincent (344 square kilometres (133\xa0sq\xa0mi)) and the northern two-thirds of the Grenadines (45 square kilometres (17\xa0sq\xa0mi)), which are a chain of small islands stretching south from Saint Vincent to Grenada. The largest and most populated Grenadines islands are Bequia, Mustique, Canouan and Union Island.[7] The Saint Vincent Passage is between the Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent islands, and the Bequia Channel is between the Grenadines and Saint Vincent islands. The Grenadines islands lie between the islands of Saint Vincent in the north and Grenada in the south. Neither Saint Vincent nor Grenada are Grenadine islands. The islands north of the Martinique Channel belong to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the islands south of the channel belong to Grenada. Administratively, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is divided into six parishes. Five parishes are on Saint Vincent, while the sixth is made up of the Grenadine islands. Kingstown is located in the Parish of Saint George and is the capital city and central administrative centre of the country. Tropical rainforest climate is a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season - all months have mean precipitation values of at least 60 millimetres (2.4\xa0in). Tropical rainforest climates have no pronounced summer or winter; it is typically hot and wet throughout the year and rainfall is both heavy and frequent.[8] The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is Af (Tropical Rainforest Climate).[8] The average yearly temperature is 27\xa0°C (81\xa0°F). The coolest months are between November and February. During the rainy season, May through October, rain is frequent in the mountains of St. Vincent with the annual average rainfall being 380 centimetres (150\xa0in) away from the coast and 200 centimetres (79\xa0in) on the coast.[7]"", 'It looks like the page you’re looking for is not available.

who was the man who stood in front of a tank,"['This will be an interesting look at history. On this Day, Interesting Histories, Mysteries of History and more… June 5th 1989 was the day during the Tiananmen Square protests that a man, now referred to as ‘Tank Man’, stepped in the path of an advancing column of tanks. The man delayed the tank’s for over an hour. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank’s attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and shown worldwide. The event occurred the day after protestors had been violently suppressed by Chinese force, known as the Tiananmen Square massacre. This has become an iconic image in world history from a time of terror in China. The man in the picture is still unknown to this day despite being the centre of such a high profile situation, what happened to the crew of the tank is also unknown. China during this time was a dangerous and militaristic country and with what occurred the day before it would be believable to think the man and even the tank crew were killed in the aftermath.

After killing a trainer in\xa0Kingsport, Tennessee, she was hanged in nearby\xa0Erwin, Tennessee, in 1916. Her death is sometimes interpreted as a\xa0cautionary tale\xa0of circus\xa0animal abuse\xa0during the early 20th century. On September 11, 1916, a homeless man named Red Eldridge, who landed a job as a transient hotel clerk\xa0was hired as an assistant elephant trainer by the\xa0Sparks World Famous Shows\xa0circus. He was killed by Mary in\xa0Sullivan County, Tennessee, on the evening of September 12. Eldridge led the elephant parade, although he was not qualified, riding on the top of Mary’s back; Mary was the star of the show, riding at the front. There have been several accounts of his death. One, recounted by W.H. Coleman, who claimed to be a witness, is that he prodded her behind the ear with a hook after she reached down to nibble on a\xa0watermelon\xa0rind. She went into a rage, snatched Eldridge with her trunk, threw him against a drink stand and stepped on his head, crushing it. “collided its trunk vice-like about [Eldridge’s ] body, lifted him 10 feet in the air, then dashed him with fury to the ground… and with the full force of her beastly fury is said to have sunk her giant tusks entirely through his body. The animal then trampled the dying form of Eldridge as if seeking a murderous triumph, then with a sudden… swing of her massive foot hurled his body into the crowd.” It is clear from the photo of her hanging that Mary was either tuskless or had short ‘tushes’ common amongst female Asian elephants. The details of the aftermath are confused in a maze of sensationalist\xa0newspaper\xa0stories and\xa0folklore. Most accounts indicate that she calmed down afterward and didn’t charge the onlookers, who began chanting, “Kill the elephant! Let’s kill it.” Within minutes, local\xa0blacksmith\xa0Hench Cox tried to kill Mary, firing five rounds with little effect.\xa0Meanwhile, the leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included. The circus owner, Charlie Sparks, reluctantly decided that the only way to quickly resolve the potentially ruinous situation was to kill the wounded elephant in public. On the following day, a foggy and rainy September 13, 1916, Mary was transported by rail to\xa0Erwin\xa0,\xa0Unicoi County, Tennessee, where a crowd of over 2,500 people (including most of the town’s children) assemb led in the\xa0Clinchfield Railroad\xa0yard. The elephant was hanged by the neck from a railcar-mounted industrial\xa0crane\xa0between four o’clock and five o’clock that evening. The first attempt resulted in a snapped chain, causing Mary to fall and break her hip as dozens of children fled in terror. The severely wounded elephant died during a second attempt and was buried beside the tracks. A veterinarian examined Mary after the hanging and determined that she had a severely infected tooth in the precise spot where Red Eldridge had prodded her. Although the authenticity of a widely distributed (and heavily retouched) photo of her death was disputed years later by\xa0Argosy\xa0magazine,\xa0other photographs taken during the incident confirm its provenance. I think Mary was treated appallingly and those that killed her should have been punished for such a heinous act . However in 1916 \xa0the world was a very different place and many folks had strange primitive attitude towards animals and animal welfare. Thankfully we now live in a more enlighten time and we are way to busy killing each other to execute our fella animals.

See: palacebarracksmemorialgarden.co.uk for more details and memorials A British Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Officer approaches a suspect device at the junction of Manor Street and Oldpark Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Manor Street marked the line between protestant and catholic neighbourhoods. The quotation on the sign on the building to the left is from the Old Testament (Amos 4:12) and it reads: Probably the most discouraging thing to possibly read before approaching something that may or may not blow you to pieces. What is even more morbid is that the technician pictured is already within the “kill” radius for an explosive of that size. Fortunately, the technician in this photo did not lose his life, the bomb did not explode. The Ammunition Technicians of the Royal Logistic Corps became highly experienced in bomb disposal, after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and other groups. The bombs employed by the PIRA ranged from simple pipe bombs to sophisticated victim-triggered devices and infra-red switches. The roadside bomb was in use by PIRA from the early 1970s onwards, evolving over time with different types of explosives and triggers. Improvised mortars were also developed by the IRA, usually placed in static vehicles, with self-destruct mechanisms. During the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland, 23 British ATO bomb disposal specialists were killed in action. The EOD squad who served in Northern Ireland pioneered gears and tactics. For example the first EOD robot was made from a wheelchair stolen from a hospital and a various pulleys and some bits of wood. Also they were first to use the protective suit. The EOD suit only protects from the shrapnel that is ejected by an explosive device, it does not prevent the technician from being killed by the pressure wave produced by a large explosion. The issue is that the bomb suit stops fragmentation injuries, but explosive force doesn’t care about the suit. Either the explosive force hits you without it and you haemorrhage and die, or it hits the suit and the suit hits you and you haemorrhage and die. It’s useful, but for smaller pipe – bombs, grenades, and small IED objects. Bomb disposal is the process by which hazardous explosive devices are rendered safe. Bomb disposal is an all-encompassing term to describe the separate, but interrelated functions in the military fields of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and improvised explosive device disposal (IEDD), and the public safety roles of public safety bomb disposal (PSBD) and the bomb squad. The Ammunition Technicians of the Royal Logistic Corps (formerly RAOC) became highly experienced in bomb disposal, after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and other groups. The bombs employed by the PIRA ranged from simple pipe bombs to sophisticated victim-triggered devices and infrared switches. The roadside bomb was in use by PIRA from the early 1970s onwards, evolving over time with different types of explosives and triggers. Improvised mortars were also developed by the IRA, usually placed in static vehicles, with self-destruct mechanisms. During the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland, 23 British ATO bomb disposal specialists were killed in action. A specialist Army unit, 321 EOD Unit (later 321 EOD Company, and now part of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC), was deployed to tackle increased IRA violence and willingness to use bombs against both economic and military targets. The unit’s radio call-sign was Felix. Many \xa0believe this to be an allusion to the cat with nine lives and led to the phrase “Fetch Felix” whenever a suspect device was encountered, which later became the title of the 1981 book Fetch Felix. However, the real reason could be either of two possibilities. All units in Northern Ireland had a callsign to be used over the radios. 321 Company, a newly formed unit, didn’t have such a callsign, so a young signaller was sent to the OC of 321 Coy. The OC, having lost two technicians that morning, decided on “Phoenix“. This was misheard as “Felix” by the signaller and was never changed. The other possible reason is that the callsign for RAOC was “Rickshaw”; however, the 321 EOD felt it needed its own callsign, hence the deliberate choice of “Felix the Cat with nine lives”. 321 Coy RAOC (now 321 EOD Sqn RLC) is unique in that it is the most decorated unit (in peace time) in the British Army with over 200 gallantry awards, notably for acts of great bravery during Operation Banner (1969–2007) in Northern Ireland. British Ammunition Technicians of 11 EOD Regiment RLC were requested by the US Forces commanders to operate in support of the US Marine Corps in clearing the Iraqi oilfields of booby traps and were among the first British service personnel sent into Iraq in 2003 prior to the actual ground invasion.

The photograph was published a week later in Life magazine, among many photographs of celebrations around the United States that were presented in a twelve-page section titled “Victory Celebrations”. A two-page spread faces three other kissing poses among celebrators in Washington, D.C.; Kansas City; and Miami opposite Eisenstaedt’s, which was given a full-page display. Kissing was a favorite pose encouraged by media photographers of service personnel during the war, but Eisenstaedt was photographing a spontaneous event that occurred in Times Square soon before the announcement of the end of the war on Japan was made by U.S. President Harry S. Truman at seven o’clock. Similar jubilation spread quickly with the news. Because he was photographing rapidly changing events during the celebrations, Eisenstaedt did not have an opportunity to get the names and details. \xa0The photograph does not clearly show the face of either person involved, and numerous people have claimed to be the subjects. The photograph was shot just south of 45th Street looking north from a location where Broadway and Seventh Avenue converge. Soon afterward, throngs of people crowded into the square and it became a sea of people. The photograph was taken at 5:51\xa0p.m. ET, according to Donald W. Olson and his team. It was taken with a Leica IIIa. In two different books he wrote, Alfred Eisenstaedt gave two slightly different accounts of taking the photograph and of its nature. In Times Square on V.J. Day I saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight. Whether she was a grandmother, stout, thin, old, didn’t make a difference. I was running ahead of him with my Leica looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me. Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse. If she had been dressed in a dark dress I would never have taken the picture. If the sailor had worn a white uniform, the same. I took exactly four pictures. It was done within a few seconds. Only one is right, on account of the balance. In the others the emphasis is wrong\xa0— the sailor on the left side is either too small or too tall. People tell me that when I am in heaven they will remember this picture. I was walking through the crowds on V-J Day, looking for pictures. I noticed a sailor coming my way. He was grabbing every female he could find and kissing them all\xa0— young girls and old ladies alike. Then I noticed the nurse, standing in that enormous crowd. I focused on her, and just as I’d hoped, the sailor came along, grabbed the nurse, and bent down to kiss her. Now if this girl hadn’t been a nurse, if she’d been dressed dark clothes, I wouldn’t have had a picture. The contrast between her white dress and the sailor’s dark uniform gives the photograph its extra impact. U.S. Navy photo journalistVictor Jorgensen captured another view of the same scene, which was published in the New York Times the following day. Jorgensen titled his photograph Kissing the War Goodbye. It shows less of Times Square in the background, lacking the characteristic view of the complex intersection so that the location needs to be identified, it is dark and shows few details of the main subjects, and it does not show the lower legs and feet of the subjects. Unlike the Eisenstaedt photograph, which is protected by copyright, this Navy photograph is in the public domain as it was produced by a federal government employee on official duty. While the angle of the photograph may be less interesting than that of Eisenstaedt’s photo, it clearly shows the actual location of the iconic kiss occurring in the front of the Chemical Bank and Trust building, with the Walgreens pharmacy signage on the building façade visible in the background. The surprised woman on the left in Jorgensen’s photograph has been positively identified as Kay Hughes Dorius of Utah. Edith Shain wrote to Eisenstaedt in the late 1970s claiming to be the woman in the picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor’s Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought she might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject. Since the identity of the woman had been claimed, in its August 1980 issue, the editors of Life asked that the kissing sailor come forward. In the October 1980 issue, the editors reported that eleven men and three women had come forward claiming to be the subjects of the photograph. Listed in the October 1980 issue as claiming to be the woman were Greta Friedman and Barbara Sokol as well as Edith Shain. On June 20, 2010, Shain died at age 91 of liver cancer.In April 2012 the issue of who the woman was, remained, as a new book on the topic was about to be released. The authors, George Galdorisi and Lawrence Verria, stated that Shain could not have been the woman because her height of just four feet ten inches was insufficient in comparison with the height of any of the men claiming to be the sailor. Galdorisi and Verria used interviews of claimants, expert photo analysis, identifying people in the background and consultations with forensic anthropologists and facial recognition specialists. They concluded that the woman was Greta Zimmer Friedman and that she was wearing her dental hygienist uniform in the photograph. “It wasn’t my choice to be kissed,” Friedman stated in a 2005 interview with the Library of Congress. “The guy just came over and grabbed!” she said, adding, “That man was very strong. I wasn’t kissing him. He was kissing me.” \xa0“I did not see him approaching, and before I know it I was in this tight grip,” Friedman told CBS News in 2012. Friedman died at age 92 on September 8, 2016, in Richmond, Virginia, due to health complications of old age. Numerous men have claimed to be the sailor, including Donald Bonsack, John Edmonson, Wallace C. Fowler, Clarence “Bud” Harding, Walker Irving, James Kearney, Marvin Kingsburg, Arthur Leask, George Mendonça, Jack Russell, and Bill Swicegood. The issue regarding the identity of the kissers is no longer contended in a court of law. George Mendonsa of Newport, Rhode Island, on leave from the USS\xa0The Sullivans\xa0(DD-537), was watching a movie with his future wife, Rita, at Radio City Music Hall when the doors opened and people started screaming the war was over. George and Rita joined the partying on the street, but when they could not get into the packed bars decided to walk down the street. It was then that George saw a woman in a white dress walk by and took her into his arms and kissed her, “I had quite a few drinks that day and I considered her one of the troops—she was a nurse.” In one of the four pictures that Eisenstaedt took, Mendonsa claims that Rita is visible in the background behind the kissing couple. In 1987, George Mendonsa filed a lawsuit against Time Inc. in Rhode Island state court, alleging that he was the sailor in the photograph and that both Time and Life had violated his right of publicity by using the photograph without his permission. After Time Inc. removed the case to federal court, Mendonsa survived a motion to dismiss. Mendonsa was identified by a team of volunteers from the Naval War College in August 2005 as “the kisser”. His claim was based on matching his scars and tattoos to scars and tattoos in the photograph. They made their determination after much study including photographic analysis by the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who were able to match scars and tattoo spotted by photograph experts, and the testimony of Richard M. Benson, a photograph analysis expert, professor of photographic studies, plus the former Dean of the School of Arts at Yale University. Benson stated that “it is therefore my opinion, based upon a reasonable degree of certainty, that George Mendonsa is the sailor in Mr. Eisenstaedt’s famous photograph.” The identity of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa’s account of the events of the day, the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows in the photographs suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, whose hour hand appears closer to the 6 o’clock position than to the 2 o’clock position; and to Victor Jorgensen’s account of the circumstances of his own picture; concluding that Mendonsa’s version of events is untenable. Carl Muscarello is a retired police officer with the New York City Police Department, now living in Plantation, Florida. In 1995, he claimed to be the kissing sailor. He claimed that he was in Times Square on August 14, 1945, and that he kissed numerous women. A distinctive birthmark on his hand enabled his mother to identify him as the subject. Edith Shain initially said she believed Muscarello’s claim to be the sailor and they even dated after their brief reunion. But in 2005, Shain was much less certain, telling the New York Times, “I can’t say he isn’t. I just can’t say he is. There is no way to tell.” Muscarello has described his condition on August 14, 1945 as being quite drunk and having no clear memory of his actions in the square, stating that his mother claimed he was the man after seeing the photograph and he came to believe it. Glenn McDuffie laid claim in 2007 and was supported by Houston Police Department forensic artist Lois Gibson. Gibson’s forensic analysis compared the Eisenstaedt photographs with current-day photographs of McDuffie, analyzing key facial features identical on both sets. She measured his ears, facial bones, hairline, wrist, knuckles, and hand, and compared those to enlargements of Eisenstaedt’s picture. I could tell just in general that yes, it’s him. But I wanted to be able to tell other people so I replicated the pose. In the August 14, 2007, issue of AM New York McDuffie said he passed five polygraph tests confirming his claim to be the man. McDuffie, a native of Kannapolis, North Carolina, who had lied about his age so he could enlist at the age of 15, went on after the war to play semi-pro baseball and work for the United States Postal Service. He says that on that day he was on the subway to Brooklyn to visit his girlfriend, Ardith Bloomfield. He came out of the subway at Times Square, where people were celebrating in the streets. Excited that his brother, who was being held by the Japanese as a prisoner of war, would be released, McDuffie began hollering and jumping up and down. A nurse saw him, and opened her arms to him. In apparent conflict with Eisenstaedt’s recollections of the event, McDuffie said he ran over to her and kissed her for a long time so that Eisenstaedt could take the photograph: I went over there and kissed her and saw a man running at us…I thought it was a jealous husband or boyfriend coming to poke me in the eyes. I looked up and saw he was taking the picture and I kissed her as long as took for him to take it. Gibson had also analyzed photographs of other men who have claimed to be the sailor, including Muscarello and Mendonça, reporting that neither man’s facial bones or other features match those of the sailor in the photograph. On August 3, 2008, Glenn McDuffie was recognized for his 81st birthday as the “Kissing Sailor” during the seventh-inning stretch of the Houston Astros and New York Mets game at Minute Maid Park.[citation needed] McDuffie died on March 14, 2014. Life‘s October 1980 issue did not include Muscarello or Glenn McDuffie. These claims have been made much more recently. Mendonça and Friedman (both individually and together), as well as Shain, Muscarello, and McDuffie, were widely interviewed in the succeeding years by Life, PBS, NBC, CBS, and others. The life stories of Mendonça and Friedman, and how they came to be in Times Square that day, as well as the reasons they are considered most likely to be the ones photographed, are the subject of a detailed book on the photo. Mendonça recognizes Friedman, to the exclusion of any other woman, as the “nurse” he kissed in the photographs (or, to be precise, the woman in the white uniform, as Friedman was a dental assistant—a nurse’s uniform was customary in a dentist’s office to be worn by female assistants and hygienists in that era). As part of a World War II memorial at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts, a new painting titled Victory Kiss by Jim Laurier of New Hampshire was first unveiled on August 24, 2013, to honor the event captured in the photo. George Mendonça was in attendance for the unveiling. In 2005, John Seward Johnson II displayed a bronze life-size sculpture, Unconditional Surrender, at an August 14, 2005, sixtieth-anniversary reenactment at Times Square of the kiss. His statue was featured in a ceremony that included Carl Muscarello and Edith Shain, holding a copy of the famous photograph, as participants. Johnson also sculpted a 25-foot-tall (7.6\xa0m) version in plastic and aluminum, which has been displayed in several cities, including San Diego and Sarasota.The 25-foot (7.6\xa0m) version was moved to New York City again on August 12, 2015, for a temporary display. In the 2009 film Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, two characters jump into a life-size enlargement of the photograph, finding themselves in a monochrome Times Square. One of them cuts in on the sailor for a kiss with the nurse. In the 2009 film Watchmen, during the opening credits, the Times Square V-J celebration is shown with a costumed heroine, Silhouette, kissing a female nurse as a photographer captures the moment. In 2009 a furor over the placement of a derivative of the photograph on public land arose in Sarasota, Florida. Television and radio programs concentrated on it, and letters to the editor were printed for months. Letters and articles in the local press continue to debate the central issue of the objections in 2015. The statue was given ten years to stay on the public land by a slim majority of city council members. In the 2010 film Letters to Juliet, the photograph is featured in a scene where a magazine editor questions a writer about her fact-checking regarding the image. In the The Simpsons episode “Bart the General“, victory celebrations following a “war” between two groups of children include a boy in a sailor outfit kissing Lisa as a photograph is taken. She then slaps the boy, exclaiming, “Knock it off!” In 2012, while performing a show for the Marines during the New York City Fleet Week, singer Katy Perry kissed a man on stage, replicating the pose. In the 2012 film Men in Black III, a time traveling character views The Kiss. In the 2014 video game Wolfenstein: The New Order, an alternative history version of the V-J Day kiss (V-A Day in the timeline) appears as a Nazi soldier forcing himself on the nurse.

He was one of the most highly experienced and well-qualified candidates accepted into the Group Air Force № 1(the first squad of cosmonauts of the USSR) . Komarov was declared medically unfit for training or spaceflight twice while he was in the program, but his perseverance and superior skills and his knowledge as an engineer allowed him to continue playing an active role. During his time at the Cosmonaut Training Center, he contributed to space vehicle design, cosmonaut training and evaluation and public relations. He was eventually selected to command the first Soviet multiman Voskhod 1 spaceflight that presented a number of technical innovations in the Space Race. Komarov was later chosen for the rigorous task of commanding Soyuz 1 as part of the Soviet Union‘s bid to reach the Moon first. His spaceflight on Soyuz 1 made him the first Soviet cosmonaut to fly into outer space more than once, and he became the first human to die on a space mission—he was killed when the Soyuz 1 space capsule crashed after re-entry on 24 April 1967 due to a parachute failure. However, because he died when the capsule crashed into the ground, he is not considered to be the first human fatality in outer space. Komarov was born in Moscow on 16 March 1927, where he grew up along with his sister Matilde. His father was a labourer who worked at various low-paid jobs to support the family. In 1935, Komarov began his formal education in the local elementary school. Here he showed a natural aptitude for mathematics. In 1941, Komarov left school because of World War II, and the German invasion of the U.S.S.R., and he became a laborer on a collective farm. He showed an interest in aeronautics from an early age, and he collected magazines and pictures about aviation, in addition to making model aircraft and his own propeller. At the age of fifteen in 1942, Komarov entered the “1st Moscow Special Air Force School” to pursue his dream of becoming an aviator. Shortly thereafter, his family learned that Komarov’s father had been killed in an “unknown war action.” Of necessity because of the German invasion, the flight school was soon moved to the Tyumen Region in Siberia for the duration of the war. Students there learned a wide variety of subjects besides aviation – including zoology and foreign languages. In 1945, Komarov graduated from flight school with honors. Hostilities ended in World War II before Komarov was called on to enter combat. In 1946, Komarov completed his first year of training at the Chkalov Higher Air Force School in Borisoglebsk in Voronezh Oblast. He then completed his training at the A.K. Serov Military Aviation College in Bataisk. Komarov’s mother died in 1948, seven months before his graduation (in 1949) at which he received his pilots wings and commission as a lieutenant in the Soviet Air Force. In December 1949, Komarov served as the pilot of a fighter plane with the 383rd Regiment of the 42nd North Caucasian Fighter Air Division that was based in Grozny. Komarov married Valentina Yakovlevna Kiselyova in October 1950. He was promoted to senior lieutenant in 1952, and he was later assigned as the chief pilot of the 486th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 279th Fighter Air Division in the Prikarpate Region. Komarov continued to fly in that position until 1954, and then he enrolled in an engineering course at the N.E. Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy. In 1959, Komarov was promoted to the rank of senior engineer-lieutenant. Later that year he achieved his goal of becoming a test pilot at the Central Scientific Research Institute at Chkalovsky. In September 1959, Komarov was promoted to engineer-captain and invited to participate in the selection process for cosmonaut candidate along with approximately 3,000 other pilots.[4] He was one of only twenty candidates selected for “Air Force Group One”, he and the others reported to the newly formed TsPK just outside Moscow for assignment on 13 March 1960. Although eminently qualified, Komarov was not chosen in the top six candidates, because he did not meet the age, height and weight restrictions specified by the “Chief Designer” of Russia’s space program: Sergei Korolev. “If the criteria had been different,” the cosmonaut trainer Mark Gallai noted in an interview, “certainly Komarov, who was very intelligent, would have been in the group. He had Air Force Academy flight experience. He had a great influence on the design of the Vostok and [the] Voskhod.” At age 32, Komarov was the second oldest of the pilots chosen – Sergei Korolev had specified a maximum age of just 27. Of the first intake, only two members, Pavel Belyayev (of Voskhod 2) and Komarov, were also graduates of the Soviet Air Force Academy. In addition, of the intake, only Komarov had experience as a flight test engineer on new aircraft. Shortly after beginning his training Komarov was hospitalised for a minor operation in May 1960, which left him medically unfit for physical training for approximately 6 months. At the time, the selection criteria placed a heavy emphasis on the physical condition of cosmonauts and any imperfection led to instant disqualification. Since Komarov already held engineering qualifications, he was allowed to remain a part of the program after assuring the administration he would be able to catch up. He continued with the required academic studies while recovering. He returned to training in October, because his recovery was more rapid than medical staff had expected. During that time he assisted his younger peers with their academic studies; earning him the casual nickname of “The Professor” which he shared with Belyayev who was two years his senior. In 1961 the first space flights began. By 1962, Komarov was the third highest paid cosmonaut, due to his qualifications, rank and experience. He earned 528 rubles a month, with only cosmonauts 1 and 2 Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov being more highly paid. When Georgi Shonin demonstrated an unacceptable level of g-force susceptibility in the centrifuge he was replaced by Komarov in May 1962 for planned dual Vostok missions. Komarov was selected as back up for Pavel Popovich (Vostok 4), but subsequent routine ECG testing of Komarov revealed a heart irregularity and he was pulled from the program and replaced by Boris Volynov. The same heart irregularity grounded American astronaut Deke Slayton. After Komarov persistently lobbied medical and military personnel to be readmitted into the program he was allowed to return to training. In 1963, cosmonaut training was conducted in 6 Groups, with Komarov being selected in Group 2 with Valery Bykovsky and Volynov. \xa0This group was to train for missions of up to five days in duration scheduled for the latter part of 1963. In May 1963 Alekseyev proposed to Kamanin that Komarov be named backup for Vostok 5 rather than Khrunov because his suit was ready. Komarov was later named in a further group for planned missions in 1964 with Belyaev, Shonin, Khrunov, Zaikin, Gorbatko, Volynov, and Leonov. The training groups were formed for later Vostok missions, (Vostok 7–13) but no actual crews were assigned and the missions did not occur under the auspices of the original Vostok program. In December 1963, Komarov was shortlisted for flight by Kamanin with Volynov and Leonov, having completed two years of training. In April 1964 Komarov was declared space-flight ready with Bykovsky, Popovich, Titov, Volynov, Leonov, Khrunov, Belyayev, and Lev Demin. From this group the commander of the planned Voskhod mission scheduled for late 1964 would be chosen. In May the group was reduced to Volynov, Komarov, Leonov, Khrunov. During training, Komarov lived at the TsPK (which would later be nicknamed Star City by the Soviet press) with his wife Valentina and their two children Yevgeny and Irina. There he enjoyed hunting, cross country skiing, ice hockey and other social activities with his fellow trainees in their leisure time. Komarov was well liked by his peers and was referred to by them as Volodya (a diminutive of his first name). Pavel Popovich noted that Komarov was respected for his humility and experience: “…he was already an engineer when he joined us, but he never looked down on the others. He was warm-hearted, purposeful and industrious. Volodya’s prestige was so high that people came to him to discuss all questions: personal as well as questions of our work.” Fellow cosmonaut Alexei Leonov described him as “…very serious. He was a first-class test pilot.” By July 1964, only seven cosmonauts remained eligible for the Voskhod crew after some of them had been disqualified on medical grounds. On 6 July, Komarov was named as the commander of the back-up crew for Voskhod 1. After much heated debate over several months about the selection of the crew between Nikolai Kamanin and Sergei Korolev, Komarov was named as prime crew commander on 4 October 1964, by the State Commission; \xa0just eight days before its scheduled launch. Kamanin played tennis with the Voskhod crew that evening and noted that Komarov played poorly in comparison to his crew: Boris Yegorov and Konstantin Feoktistov. On 9 October, Komarov and the crew inspected the Voskhod with Korolev and other members of the administration. Later that day they were interviewed by the state press and played tennis for the benefit of photographers. On the morning of 11 October, Komarov was given various communist relics to take with him into space the following day. In the afternoon the crew again inspected the capsule and were given their final instructions by Korolev. Komarov was the only member of the crew to have undertaken extensive training and was the only member with any flight experience; the two other crewmen being civilians. His call sign was “Ruby” (Russian: Рубин). During the mission Komarov performed various tasks with the other crew members, including medical and navigational tests and observing the Aurora Borealis. He also made a number of radio transmissions, including a greeting to the Tokyo Olympics which had opened on 10 October. Some of the transmissions Komarov made were recorded by amateur radio operators like Sven Grahn. The mission lasted just over twenty-four hours. After the crew landed safely they were flown back to the launch site at Tyuratam (also known as Baikonur to disguise its true location). Kamanin noted in his diary that while his crew were in good spirits, Komarov was fatigued. On 19 October, Komarov and his crew made reports in Red Square and attended an audience at the Kremlin. After the success of this short but scientifically important mission he was promoted to colonel. The success of the mission earned Komarov the awards of the Order of Lenin and Hero of the Soviet Union. In December 1964, the RSVN (Strategic Rocket Forces) requested that Komarov be transferred from the VVS (Soviet Air Force) to the RSVN, in a move possibly motivated by the poor record of the RSVN in producing successful rockets compared to the VVS. The request was opposed by Kamanin. In 1965, Komarov worked with Yuri Gagarin in supervising preparations for the flight of Voskhod 2, which carried out the first attempt of an extravehicular activity in outer space. These preparations included fitting of space suits on the cosmonauts and briefings for the spaceflight. In April of that year, Komarov toured St. Petersburg, Russia, with Kamanin, Gagarin, Gherman Titov, Belyayev, and Leonov, and Komarov visited Petropavlovsk Fortress with Valentin Glushko where he had conducted the first rocket experiments in the early 1930s. In September that year, Komarov toured West Germany. Komarov was assigned to the Soviet Soyuz program along with Yuri Gagarin and Alexei Leonov. In July 1966, Komarov was reprimanded by Kamanin for his unauthorised disclosure, while in Japan, that “the Soviet Union will, at the scheduled time, fly an automated spacecraft around the Moon and return it to (the) Earth, to be followed by a dog flight, then a manned circumlunar flight.” The following month Komarov clashed with other engineers over ongoing design problems in which zero-G tests showed that the Soyuz module hatch was too small to allow the exit of a fully suited cosmonaut safely. Meanwhile, Komarov and his fellow cosmonauts had their groups and assignments constantly revised and they became increasingly anxious about the lack of response to their concerns about the design and manufacture of space craft which had been raised in a letter to Leonid Brezhnev by Yuri Gagarin on their behalf. Komarov was selected to command the Soyuz 1, in 1967, with Yuri Gagarin as his backup cosmonaut. During the preparations for the spaceflight, both cosmonauts were working twelve- to fourteen-hour days. On orbital insertion, the solar panels of the Soyuz module failed to fully deploy thereby preventing the craft from being fully powered and obscuring some of the navigation equipment. Komarov reported: “Conditions are poor. The cabin parameters are normal, but the left solar panel didn’t deploy. The electrical bus is at only 13 to 14 amperes. The HF (high frequency) communications are not working. I cannot orient the spacecraft to the sun. I tried orienting the spacecraft manually using the DO-1 orientation engines, but the pressure remaining on the DO-1 has gone down to 180.” Komarov tried unsuccessfully to orient the Soyuz module for five hours. The craft was transmitting unreliable status information and communications were lost on orbits 13 through 15 due to the failure of the high frequency transmitter which would have maintained radio contact while the craft was out of range of the ultra-high frequency (UHF) receivers on the ground. As a result of the problems with the craft, the second Soyuz module which was to have carried cosmonauts to perform an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) to the Soyuz 1 was not launched and the mission was cut short. Komarov was ordered to re-orient the craft using the ion system on orbits 15 to 17. The ion engine system failed. Komarov did not have enough time to attempt a manual re-entry until orbit 19. Manual orientation relied on using the equipped Vzor device, but in order to do this, Komarov needed to be able to see the Sun. To reach the designated landing site at Orsk the retro-fire would need to take place on the night side of the Earth. Komarov oriented the spacecraft manually on the dayside then used the gyro-platform as a reference so that he could orient the craft for a night side retro-fire. He successfully re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere on his 19th orbit, but the module’s drogue and main braking parachute failed to deploy correctly and the module crashed into the ground, killing Komarov. According to the 1998 book Starman, by Jamie Doran and Piers Bizony, as Komarov sped towards his death, U.S. listening posts in Turkey picked up transmissions of him crying in rage, “cursing the people who had put him inside a botched spaceship.” On 25 April, a response to Komarov’s death by his fellow cosmonauts was published in Pravda: “For the forerunners it is always more difficult. They tread the unknown paths and these paths are not straight, they have sharp turns, surprises and dangers. But anyone who takes the pathway into orbit never wants to leave it. And no matter what difficulties or obstacles there are, they are never strong enough to deflect such a man from his chosen path. While his heart beats in his chest, a cosmonaut will always continue to challenge the universe. Vladimir Komarov was one of the first on this treacherous path.” When interviewed on 17 May by the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, Yuri Gagarin alluded to the failure of the administration to listen to the concerns about the Soyuz module that were identified by the cosmonaut corps and that Komarov’s death should teach the establishment to be more rigorous in its testing and evaluation of “all the mechanisms of the spaceship, even more attentive to all stages of checking and testing, even more vigilant in our encounter with the unknown. He has shown us how dangerous the pathway to space is. His flight and his death will teach us courage.” In May 1967, Gagarin and Leonov criticised program head Vasily Mishin‘s “poor knowledge of the Soyuz spacecraft and the details of its operation, his lack of cooperation in working with the cosmonauts in flight and training activities” and asked Kamanin for him to be cited in the official report into the crash. After Komarov’s death, the communications systems on board all Soviet spacecraft were modified because Komarov’s voice transmissions from Soyuz 1 had blocked its telemetry signals. “He was our friend. Before his death the press and public had paid little attention to the extreme risks we took.” On 26 April 1967, Komarov was given a state funeral in Moscow, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square. The American astronauts requested the Soviet government to allow a representative to attend, but were turned down. Komarov was posthumously awarded his second Order of Lenin and also the Order of Hero of the Soviet Union. Kamanin noted in his diary that over 10,000 people were present at this service, “some driving hundreds of kilometres for the event.” Komarov has been featured on commemorative First Day Covers and stamps for his contribution to the space program – from several different countries. Komarov is commemorated with other prominent figures from the early Russian space program with a bust on Cosmonauts Alley in Moscow, and he is also honored with a monument at the crash site near Orsk. Before leaving the Moon on Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong‘s final task was to place a small package of memorial items to honor Komarov, Yuri Gagarin, and the Apollo 1 astronauts Virgil Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee. Komarov’s name also appears on a commemorative plaque left at Hadley Rille on the Moon by the commander of Apollo 15, David Scott in memory of 14 deceased NASA astronauts and USSR cosmonauts, along with a small sculpture entitled Fallen Astronaut, on 1 August 1971. This plaque and the sculpture represent those astronauts and cosmonauts who died in the quest to reach outer space and the Moon. The asteroid 1836 Komarov, discovered in 1971, was named in the honor of Komarov, as was a crater on the Moon.[35] This asteroid and the cosmonaut inspired the composer Brett Dean to write a piece of symphonic music commissioned by conductor Simon Rattle in 2006. The composition is named Komarov’s Fall, and it can be found on the EMI Classics Album of Simon Rattle’s The Planets. Among other honors, the Vladimir M. Komarov Astronautical Rocketry Club (ARK) in Ljubljana has also borne Komarov’s name since 1969. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale‘s V.M. Komarov Diploma is named in Komarov’s honor. There was formerly a Soviet satellite-tracking ship named for Komarov, the Kosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. The Estonian band Sõpruse Puiestee (Friendship Boulevard) wrote a song “Planeetidegi vahel kehtib raskus” (“Difficulty stands even between planets”) in honor of Komarov. This recording was completed 43 years after Komarov’s death, on 24 April 2010. The French electro band named Kowalsky wrote a song “Lost” (2008) in honor of Komarov, in which the listener can hear his last words. The American progressive metal band Cormorant wrote a song “Unearthly Dreamings” (2011) about Komarov’s failed space mission. Mehmet Baydur, a Turkish playwright who died on 24 November 2001, wrote a play titled Vladmir Komarov about what happened on his last day, 24 April 1967. The Finnish band This Empty Flow wrote a song called “Towards Distant (the death of Komarov during re-entry).” It includes a broadcast message made by Komarov during the Soyuz 1 flight Valentina Komarov, the widow of Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov, kisses a photograph of her dead husband during his official funeral, held in Moscow’s Red Square on April 26, 1967.

AP photojournalist Horst Faas took this iconic photo on June 18, 1965, during the Vietnam War with the 173rd Airborne Brigade Battalion on defense duty at Phouc Vinh airstrip in South Vietnam. The headband message “War is Hell” typified an acerbic attitude of many young American soldiers who were likely drafted and sent to the remote southeastern Asia jungles to engage in deadly and terrifying combat. A lot of the soldiers wrote graffiti on their helmets with inscriptions of their attitudes about where they were and why they were there. The contrast is what makes this photo iconic. You have this, bright, young handsome soldier with a smile on his face and then you have the text on his helmet. Take the helmet out, and this could easily be a high school yearbook photo. His face betrays a sense of innocence, but when you look at his helmet, you can tell that he is anything but. You know that he has witnessed the horrors of war firsthand and is trying to cover it all up on the outside. The identity of the soldier was unknown for many decades until recently when he was identified as Larry Wayne Chaffin from St. Louis. He served with that brigade in Vietnam for exactly one year beginning in May 1965 and when the photo was taken he was 19. Chaffin had many problems adjusting to civilian life when he returned from Vietnam. He died at the age of 39 from complications that arose from diabetes, an ailment he might have contracted from exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. He died in 1985. The “War is Hell” quote originates from William Tecumseh Sherman’ address to the graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy (19 June 1879); but slightly varying accounts of this speech have been published. Sherman was a Union Army general during the American Civil War. He succeeded General U.S. Grant as commander of the Western Theatre of that war in the spring of 1864. “I’ve been where you are now and I know just how you feel. It’s entirely natural that there should beat in the breast of every one of you a hope and desire that some day you can use the skill you have acquired here. Suppress it! You don’t know the horrible aspects of war. I’ve been through two wars and I know. I’ve seen cities and homes in ashes. I’ve seen thousands of men lying on the ground, their dead faces looking up at the skies. I tell you, War is Hell!“. (Photo credit: Associated Press Photos). Horst Faas (28 April 1933\xa0– 10 May 2012) was a Germanphoto-journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner. He is best known for his images of the Vietnam War. Born in Berlin, Germany, Faas began his photographic career in 1951 with the Keystone Agency, and by the age of 21 he was already covering major events concerning Indochina, including the peace negotiations in Geneva in 1954. In 1956 he joined the Associated Press (AP), where he acquired a reputation for being an unflinching hard-news war photographer, covering the wars in Vietnam and Laos, as well as in the Congo and Algeria. In 1962, he became AP’s chief photographer for Southeast Asia, and was based in Saigon until 1974. His images of the Vietnam War won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1965. In 1967 he was severely wounded in the legs by a rocket-propelled grenade. In 1972, he collected a second Pulitzer, for his coverage of the conflict in Bangladesh. Inside Bangladesh, photographer Rashid Talukder considered it too dangerous to publish his photographs and he released them more than twenty years after Horst’s photographs had appeared. Faas is also famed for his work as a picture editor, and was instrumental in ensuring the publication of two of the most famous images of the Vietnam War. The notorious “Saigon Execution” photograph, showing the summary execution of a Viet Cong prisoner by Saigon police chief Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, taken by Eddie Adams in Saigon on February 1, 1968 was sent under his direction. Nick Ut‘s famous “Napalm Girl” photograph caused a huge controversy over at the AP bureau; an editor had objected to the photo, saying that the girl depicted was naked and that nobody would accept it. Faas ordered that Ut’s photo be sent over the wire. In September 1990, freelance photographer Greg Marinovich submitted a series of graphic photos of a crowd executing a man to the AP bureau in Johannesburg. Once again, AP editors were uncertain if the photos should be sent over the wire. One editor sent the images to Faas, who telegrammed back, “send all photos.” In 1976, Faas moved to London as AP’s senior photo editor for Europe; he retired in 2004. In retirement he organised reunions of the wartime Saigon press corps and ran international photojournalism symposiums. He produced four books on his career and other news photographers, including Requiem, a book about photographers killed on both sides of the Vietnam War, co-edited with fellow Vietnam War photojournalist Tim Page. In 2012 the subject of his iconic photo (a soldier at Phouc Vinh airstrip) is claimed to be Larry Wayne Chaffin, a soldier with the 173rd Airborne Brigade Battalion, who was on defence duty (18 June 1965) during the Vietnam War.

Since Japanese coastal defense guns were firing at the plane while it was in the water during take-off, this brave young man, after rescuing the pilot, manned his position as machine gunner without taking time to put on his clothes. A hero photographed right after he’d completed his heroic act. Naked. Photo taken by Horace Bristol (1908-1997). In 1941, Bristol was recruited to the U.S. Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, as one of six photographers under the command of Captain Edward J. Steichen, documenting World War II in places such as South Africa, and Japan. He ended up being on the plane the gunner was serving on, which was used to rescue people from Rabaul Bay (New Britain Island, Papua New Guinea), when this occurred. In an article from a December 2002 issue of B&W magazine he remembers: “…we got a call to pick up an airman who was down in the Bay. The Japanese were shooting at him from the island, and when they saw us they started shooting at us. The man who was shot down was temporarily blinded, so one of our crew stripped off his clothes and jumped in to bring him aboard. He couldn’t have swum very well wearing his boots and clothes. As soon as we could, we took off. We weren’t waiting around for anybody to put on formal clothes. We were being shot at and wanted to get the hell out of there. The naked man got back into his position at his gun in the blister of the plane.” The identity of the gunner has never been established . Horace Bristol (November 16, 1908 – August 4, 1997) was a twentieth-century American photographer, best known for his work in Life. His photos appeared in Time, Fortune, Sunset, and National Geographic magazines. Bristol was born and raised in Whittier, California, and attended the Art Center of Los Angeles, originally majoring in architecture. In 1933, he moved to San Francisco to work in commercial photography, and met Ansel Adams, who lived near his studio. Through his friendship with Adams, he met Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, and other artists. He was copy reader at night for the Los Angeles Times after graduating from Belmont High School. In 1936, Bristol became a part of Life‘s founding photographers, and in 1938, began to document migrant farmers in California’s central valley with John Steinbeck, recording the Great Depression, photographs that would later be called the Grapes of Wrath collection. In 1941, Bristol was recruited to the U.S. Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, as one of six photographers under the command of Captain Edward J. Steichen, \xa0documenting World War II in places such as South Africa, and Japan. Bristol helped to document the invasions of North Africa, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Following his documentation of World War II, Bristol settled in Tokyo, Japan, selling his photographs to magazines in Europe and the United States, and becoming the Asian correspondent to Fortune. He published several books, and established the East-West Photo Agency. Following the death of his wife in 1956, Bristol burned all his negatives, packed his photographs into storage, and retired from photography. He went on to remarry, and have two children. He returned to the United States, and after 30 years, recovered the photographs from storage, to share with his family. Subsequently he approached his alma mater, Art Center College of Design, where the World War II and migrant worker photographs became the subject of a 1989 solo exhibition. The migrant worker photos would go on to be part of the J. Paul Getty Museum‘s Grapes of Wrath series. Bristol lived in Ojai, California, until his death in 1997 at the age of 89. Bristol’s work is displayed around the world, including the Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2006, a documentary was made, The Compassionate Eye: Horace Bristol, Photojournalist, written and directed by David Rabinovitch.

He committed self-immolation as a political protest against the end of the Prague Spring resulting from the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact armies. In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the liberalising reforms of Alexander Dubček‘s government during what was known as the Prague Spring. Prague-born Palach decided to sacrifice himself in protest of the invasion and set himself on fire, in Wenceslas Square, on 16 January 1969. According to a letter he sent to several public figures, an entire clandestine resistance organization had been established with the purpose of practicing self-immolation until their demands were met; however, it seems that such a group never existed.[1] The demands declared in the letter were the abolition of censorship and a halt to the distribution of Zprávy, the official newspaper of the Soviet occupying forces. In addition, the letter called for the Czech and the Slovak peoples to go on a general strike in support of these demands.[2] An earlier draft of the letter that Palach wrote also called for the resignation of a number of pro-Soviet politicians,[3] but that demand did not make it into the final version, which included the remark that “our demands are not extreme, on the contrary”. Palach died from his burns several days after his act, at the hospital. On his deathbed, he was visited by a female acquaintance from his college and by a student leader, to whom he had addressed one of the copies of his letter. It was reported that he had pleaded for others not to do what he had done but instead to continue the struggle by other means, although it has been doubted whether he really said that.[4] According to Jaroslava Moserová, a burns specialist who was the first to provide care to Palach at the Charles University Faculty Hospital, Palach did not set himself on fire to protest against the Soviet occupation, but did so to protest against the “demoralization” of Czechoslovak citizens caused by the occupation. The funeral of Palach turned into a major protest against the occupation, and a month later (on 25 February 1969) another student, Jan Zajíc, burned himself to death in the same place, followed in April of the same year by Evžen Plocek in Jihlava. Palach was initially interred in Olšany Cemetery. As his gravesite was growing into a national shrine, the Czechoslovak secret police (StB) set out to destroy any memory of Palach’s deed and exhumed his remains on the night of 25 October 1973. His body was then cremated and sent to his mother in Palach’s native town of Všetaty while an anonymous old woman from a rest home was laid in the grave.[6] Palach’s mother was not allowed to deposit the urn in the local cemetery until 1974. On 25 October 1990 the urn was officially returned to its initial site in Prague. On the 20th anniversary of Palach’s death, protests ostensibly in memory of Palach (but intended as criticism of the regime) escalated into what would be called “Palach Week”. The series of anticommunist demonstrations in Prague between 15 and 21 January 1989 were suppressed by the police, who beat demonstrators and used water cannons, often catching passers-by in the fray. Palach Week is considered one of the catalyst demonstrations which preceded the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia 10 months later.[citation needed] After the Velvet Revolution, Palach (along with Zajíc) was commemorated in Prague by a bronze cross embedded at the spot where he fell outside the National Museum, as well as a square named in his honour. The Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek, who left Czechoslovakia the following year, named an asteroid which had been discovered on 22 August 1969, after Jan Palach (1834 Palach). There are several other memorials to Palach in cities throughout Europe, including a small memorial inside the glacier tunnels beneath the Jungfraujoch in Switzerland. Several later incidents of self-immolation may have been influenced by the example of Palach and his media popularity. In the spring of 2003, a total of six young Czechs burned themselves to death,[7] notably Zdeněk Adamec, a 19-year-old student from Humpolec who burned himself on 6 March 2003 on almost the same spot in front of the National Museum where Palach burnt himself, leaving a suicide note explicitly referring to Palach and the others who had committed suicide in the 1969 Prague Spring.[8]) Just walking distance from the site of Palach’s self-immolation, a statuary in Prague’s Old Town Square honours iconic Bohemian religious thinker Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1415. Himself celebrated as a national hero for many centuries, some commentary has linked Palach’s self-immolation to the execution of Hus.[9][10][11] The music video for the song “Club Foot” by the band Kasabian is dedicated to Palach. The composition “The Funeral of Jan Palach” performed by The Zippo Band and composed by Phil Kline is a tribute. He is mentioned in The Stranglers‘ bassist, Jean-Jacques Burnel‘s 1979 solo album, Euroman Cometh. After seeking political asylum in the United States, Polish artist Wiktor Szostalo commemorated Jan Palach in his “Performance for Freedom” proclaiming “I am Jan Palach. I’m a Czech, I’m a Pole, a Lithuanian, a Vietnamese, an Afghani, a betrayed You. After I’ve burnt myself a thousand times, perhaps we’ll win”.[12] On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, a statue sculpted by András Beck as a tribute to the student was transported from France to the Czech Republic. The statue was installed in Mělník, the city where Jan Palach did his studies.[13] Italian songwriter Francesco Guccini wrote a song “La Primavera di Praga” in dedication to Jan Palach, compared to religious scholar Jan Hus: “Once again Jan Hus is burning alive”. Polish singer Jacek Kaczmarski wrote a song about Palach’s suicide, called “Pochodnie” (“Torches”). The Italian far-right Folk group, ”La Compagnia dell’Anello” released a song dedicated to him, titled Jan Palach. The Kasabian, British band, released the “Club Foot” on their 2004 debut album Kasabian on 17 May 2004 in the UK. The video of this song is dedicated to Jan Palach. The Luxembourg-based Welsh composer Dafydd Bullock was commissioned to write “Requiem for Jan Palach” (op 182) to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of Palach’s suicide. It includes a setting of words which appeared briefly on a statue in Wenceslas Square after the event, before being erased by the authorities: “Do not be indifferent to the day when the light of the future was carried forward by a burning body”.[14] In their 1983 song “Nuuj Helde” the Janse Bagge Bend (from the Netherlands) asks whether people know why Jan Palach burned. This song was meant to make the general public aware of heroes. Palach featured in a monologue radio play entitled “Torch No 1” on BBC Radio 4, directed by Martin Jenkins, and written by David Pownall. Palach was played by Karl Davies.[15] French documentary filmmaker Raymond Depardon directed a 1969 film about Jan Palach. Norwegian songwriter Hans Rotmo mentioned Palach’s name among other notable political activists such as Victor Jara and Steve Biko in his 1989 song “Lennon Street”. Norwegian songwriter and singer Åge Aleksandersen mentioned Palach’s name in his 1984 song “Va det du Jesus”. A sequence of poems exploring the implications of Palach’s death called One Match by the poet Sheila Hamilton were published in issue 51 of the Dorset-based poetry serial, Tears in the Fence (ed. David Caddy) in 2010. A three-part 2013 Czech-Polish television show “Burning Bush“, directed by Agnieszka Holland, is situated around the events that happened after Jan Palach’s self-immolation. American Metal band Lamb of God wrote a song on their studio album VII: Sturm und Drang, entitled “Torches”, that was inspired by Palach’s actions.[citation needed] In the Czech republic, many towns have streets or squares named after Palach, of which perhaps most notable is the Jan Palach Square in central Prague. He also had streets named after him in Luxembourg city (Luxembourg), Angers and Parthenay (France), Kraków (Poland), Assen and Haarlem (Netherlands), Varna (Bulgaria) and Nantwich (United Kingdom). In Rome (Italy) (as well as in many other Italian towns), there is a central square named after Palach with a commemorative statue. The oldest rock club in Croatia is named Palach. It is situated in Rijeka since 1969 to this day. There is a bus station in the town of Curepipe, Mauritius named after Jan Palach. A student hall in Venice, Italy on the Giudecca island has also been given the name of Jan Palach.

As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank’s attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and seen worldwide. Currently, there is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the tank man. 1989 Raw Video: Man vs. Chinese tank Tiananmen Square The incident took place near Tiananmen on Chang’an Avenue, which runs east-west along the north end of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, on June 5, 1989, one day after the Chinese government’s violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests.[4] The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags, one in each hand.[5] As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with his bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action.[6] After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse. Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver’s hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank’s turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner’s hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on. At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff. Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.[6] Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, said it was the Chinese government PSB (Public Security Bureau),[7] while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, Time included the “Unknown Rebel” in a feature titled Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century.[8] Little is publicly known of the man’s identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid the Sunday Express named him as Wang Weilin (王维林), a 19-year-old student[9] who was later charged with “political hooliganism” and “attempting to subvert members of the People’s Liberation Army.”[10] However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights.[11] One party member was quoted as saying, “We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison.”[11] Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man’s identity and current whereabouts.[12] There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President’s Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, reported that he was executed 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.[6] In Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have “no idea who he was either” and that he’s still alive somewhere on the mainland. The government of the People’s Republic of China has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), “I can’t confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,” and then replied in English, “I think…never killed” [sic].[13] At the time, the party’s propaganda apparatus referred to the incident as showing the “humanity” of the country’s military.[14] In a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Jiang Zemin said, “He was never arrested.” He then stated, “I don’t know where he is now.” He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.[15] Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989[11][16] and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of the 20th century.[1][2][3] However, a PBS interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.[17] Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China.[11] When undergraduate students at Beijing University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they “were genuinely mystified.”[18] One of the students said that the image was “artwork.” It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man, that he whispered to the student next to him “89”–which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event. It has been suggested that the “Unknown Rebel,” if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.[11] At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.[19] Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.[20] On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.[16] The widest coverage of the event, and one of the best-known photographs of the event, appearing in both Time and Life magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.[20] The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about half a mile (800\xa0meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter.[21] With Widener running out of film, a friend hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.[22] Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world[20] and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.[22] Wider shot by Stuart Franklin showing column of tanks. Charlie Cole, working for Newsweek and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to Newsweek.[20] Franklin won a World Press Award for a similar photo.[23] It was featured in Life\u200d\u200d\u200a’\u200b\u200ds “100 Photographs That Changed the World” in 2003. On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter Terril Jones revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.[24] Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,[25] but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.[20] It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener’s work, they re-checked Wah’s negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener’s. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A “foreign” photographer accompanying him suddenly said, “I am not gonna die for your country,” and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.[25] In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the world. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua and CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer appear to be the only two television cameramen who captured the scene.[26][27] ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony.[28] After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the “tank man” incident occurred.[19][29] Stuart Franklin (born London, 16 June 1956[1]) is a photographer, a member of Magnum Photos, and a former President of Magnum Photos (2006–2009).[2] He was born at Guys Hospital, London. Franklin studied drawing under Leonard McComb in Oxford and Whitechapel, London, and from 1976–1979 photography at West Surrey College of Art and Design, where he graduated with a BA. Moreover, between 1995 and 1997, he studied geography at the University of Oxford, first receiving a BA and the Gibbs Prize for geography. He received a doctorate in Geography from the University of Oxford in 2000.[1] From 1980 until 1985, Franklin worked with Agence Presse Sygma in Paris. During that time he photographed the civil war in Lebanon, unemployed people in Britain, famine in Sudan and the Heysel Stadium disaster. Joining Magnum Photos in 1985,[2] he became a full member in 1989. In the same year, Franklin photographed the uprising in Tiananmen Square and shot one of the Tank Man photographs, first published in Time Magazine, as well as widely documenting the uprising in Beijing [3][4] earning him a World Press Photo Award. In 1989 Franklin traveled with Greenpeace to Antarctica. He worked on about twenty stories for National Geographic between 1991 and 2009, subjects including Inca conqueror Francisco Pizarro and the hydro-struggle in Quebec and places such as Buenos Aires and Malaysia.[1] In addition, he worked on book and cultural projects. In October 2008, his book Footprint: Our Landscape in Flux was published by Thames & Hudson. An ominous photographic document of Europe’s changing landscape, it highlights Franklin’s deep ecological concern. During 2009 Franklin curated an exhibition on Gaza – “Point of No Return” for the Noorderlicht Photo Festival. Since 2009 Franklin has focused on a long term landscape project in Norway published as “Narcissus” in 2013. Recently Franklin has worked on documentary projects on doctors working in Syria, and immigration in Calais. He leads a programme in documentary photography at Høgskulen i Volda, Norway.

Earthrise is a photograph of the Earth taken by astronaut William Anders in 1968, during the Apollo 8 mission. Nature photographer Galen Rowell declared it “the most influential environmental photograph ever taken.”[1] This had been preceded by the crude 1966 black-and-white raster earthrise image taken by the Lunar Earthrise is the name given to NASA image AS8-14-2383, taken by astronaut William Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, the first manned voyage to orbit the Moon.[1][2] Initially, before Anders found a suitable 70\xa0mm color film, mission commander Frank Borman took a black-and-white photograph[3] of the scene, with the Earth’s terminator touching the horizon. The land mass position and cloud patterns in this image are the same as those of the color photograph entitled Earthrise.[4] The photograph was taken from lunar orbit on December 24, 1968, with a highly modified Hasselblad 500 EL with an electric drive. The camera had a simple sighting ring rather than the standard reflex viewfinder and was loaded with a 70\xa0mm film magazine containing custom Ektachrome film developed by Kodak. An audio recording of the event is available[5] with transcription[6] which allows the event to be followed closely – excerpt:[7] There were many images taken at that point. The mission audio tape establishes several photographs were taken, on Borman’s orders, with the enthusiastic concurrence of Lovell and Anders. Anders took the first color shot, then Lovell who notes the setting (1/250th of a second at f/11), followed by Anders with another two at varying exposures. A nearly full-page black and white reproduction of Borman’s image may be viewed on page 164 of his 1988 autobiography, captioned, “One of the most famous pictures in photographic history — taken after I grabbed the camera away from Bill Anders”. Borman was the mission commander and notes[8] (pg. 212) that this is the image “the Postal Service used on a stamp, and few photographs have been more frequently reproduced” [but see above]. The photograph reproduced in the Frank Borman autobiography is not the same image as the Anders photograph; aside from the orientation, the cloud patterns differ. The stamp issue reproduces the cloud, color, and crater patterns of the Anders picture. Anders is described (pg. 193) by Borman as holding “a masters degree in nuclear engineering”; Anders was thus tasked as “the scientific crew member … also performing the photography duties that would be so important to the Apollo crew who actually landed on the Moon”. In Life ‘s 100 Photographs that Changed the World, wilderness photographer Galen Rowell called Earthrise “the most influential environmental photograph ever taken.”[9] Another author called its appearance the beginning of the environmental movement.[10] U.S. postage stamp (Scott #1371) In 1969, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp (Scott # 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon. The stamp featured a detail (in color) of the Earthrise photograph, and the words, “In the beginning God…”, recalling the Apollo 8 Genesis reading. On April 6, 2008 (Japan Standard Time), the first 1080p high-definition Earthrise video was captured, both a full Earthrise and Earthset video, by the JAXA lunar orbiter mission, SELENE (better known in Japan by its nickname Kaguya). After successfully orbiting the Moon for 1 year and 8 months, it was crashed intentionally onto the lunar surface at 18:25 UTC on June 10, 2009.[11] Earthrise Revisited 2013, a recreation showing the rising Earth as it must have looked to Anders, Borman, and Lovell in 1968. In 2013, in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission, NASA issued a video about the taking of the photograph.[12] This computer-generated visualization used data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which had provided detailed images of the lunar surface that could be matched with those taken every 20 seconds by an automatic camera on Apollo 8. The resulting video, re-creating what the astronauts would have seen, was synchronized with the recording of the crew’s conversation as they became the first humans to witness an Earthrise. The video included explanatory narration written and read by Andrew Chaikin.[13] An earthrise that might be witnessed from the surface of the Moon would be quite unlike moonrises on Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, one side of the Moon always faces toward Earth. Interpretation of this fact would lead one to believe that the Earth’s position is fixed on the lunar sky and no earthrises can occur, however, the Moon librates slightly, which causes the Earth to draw a Lissajous figure on the sky. This figure fits inside a rectangle 15°48′ wide and 13°20′ high (in angular dimensions), while the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from Moon is only about 2°. This means that earthrises are visible near the edge of the Earth-observable surface of the Moon (about 20% of the surface). Since a full libration cycle takes about 27 days, earthrises are very slow, and it takes about 48 hours for Earth to clear its diameter.[14] During the course of the month-long lunar orbit, an observer would additionally witness a succession of “Earth phases”, much like the lunar phases seen from Earth. That is what accounts for the half-illuminated globe seen in the photograph. I’m no expert, \xa0but I sincerely believe that we are not alone in the universe . I just find it inconceivable that out of these vast numbers our solar system is the only place that life took\xa0hold and evolved into the beautiful earth we know today. I’m no Expert . But I assume that every thing that was needed to create the conditions for life on earth were no doubt abundant throughout space during the birth and evolution\xa0 of space and the\xa0birth of\xa0Galaxies . I’m not saying that life\xa0is \xa0abundant throughout our galaxy and the billions of \xa0other galaxies out there , but surely the same elements that kick started life on earth must have travelled through space and found a home on other worlds out there. Unfortunately \xa0due to the vast distances to these other worlds and galaxies we will never be able to travel to them or indeed send space ships and probes to unlock their secrets. I expect that most life forms out there are single cell and far below the complex life forms that are found on earth. The mind boggle….

After four days of harassment that threatened her safety, her parents forced her to withdraw from the school. In 1956, forty black students applied for transfers at a white school.\xa0 This was after the passing of the Pearsall Plan in North Carolina. At 15 years of age, on 4 September 1957, Dorothy Counts was one of the four black students enrolled at various all-white schools in the district; She was at Harry Harding High School, Charlotte, North Carolina. Three students were enrolled at other schools, including Central High School. The harassment started when the wife of John Z. Warlick, the leader of the White Citizens Council, urged the boys to “keep her out” and at the same time, implored the girls to spit on her, saying, “spit on her, girls, spit on her.” Dorothy walked by without reacting, but told the press that many people threw rocks at her—most of which landed in front of her feet—and that many spat on her back. Photographer Douglas Martin won the 1957 World Press Photo of the Year with an image of Counts being mocked by a crowd on her first day of school. More abuse followed that day. She had trash thrown at her while eating her dinner and the teachers ignored her.\xa0The following day, she befriended two white girls, but they soon drew back because of harassment from other classmates. Her family received threatening phone calls and after four days of extensive harassment—which included a smashed car and having her locker ransacked, her father decided to take his daughter out of the school.[1] At a press conference, he said: It is with compassion for our native land and love for our daughter Dorothy that we withdraw her as a student at Harding High School. As long as we felt she could be protected from bodily injury and insults within the school’s walls and upon the school premises, we were willing to grant her desire to study at Harding. The family moved to Pennsylvania, where Counts attended an integrated school in Philadelphia, and later earned a degree from Johnson C. Smith University. She has spent her professional career in child care resources. In 2008, Harding High School awarded Counts an honorary diploma. In 2010, Counts received a public apology from a member of the crowd which harassed her in 1957.[7] In 2010, Harding High School renamed its library in honor of Counts-Scoggins, an honour rarely bestowed upon living persons.

Groningen, The Netherlands', 'Studies are a roller-coaster ride for many students. One day, you might feel energized and motivated to attend lectures and compose homework assignments. The other day, you might get overwhelmed by competing work and study duties, suffer burnout, or lack the inspiration to do anything, as there’s too much on your plate. It’s normal for modern students who usually juggle many responsibilities and combine studies, work, childcare, and many other routines a regular human being can’t manage at once. Thus, it’s fully okay that you sometimes feel you need help. Once you experience frustration and academic burnout, it’s vital to give yourself a breath of fresh air and take a pause without undermining your grades. In this case, an academic writing helper can come in handy as a discrete and efficient tool for closing your academic gaps without confessing to your problems. However, choosing an essay writing service USA for regular use is always challenging. There are so many scammers online that you might have grown distrustful of online service providers. Thus, it’s important to do your due diligence and evaluate the candidates against a set of quality parameters. The good news is that EssayUSA is your go-to provider; our company meets the most rigorous quality requirements and stands apart from the crowd of competitors due to service excellence. We’ve been in the sphere of academic writing for quite a long time and have established a solid reputation for the company, thus becoming a safe bet for students and researchers at all levels. Welcome to a place where students find the needed help and study better without overstretching their mental and financial resources. This is a unique package of benefits you can get with every order, and our company’s reputation fully guarantees all these advantages’ presence at every stage of service delivery. However, that’s not all you get here. By working with our professional essay writing service, you can get a set of appealing freebies coming with every order (regardless of its size): Thus, you pay only for the pages your author composes on the given prompt; the rest is delivered free of charge to give your assignment a finished, polished look and make it ready for submission. Another feature that distinguishes us from other essay writing services in USA is a strong commitment to top writer talent selection. We have developed a proprietary system of writer recruitment and screening to ensure only seasoned authors with a passion for writing get to the team. Here are the main principles of our hiring process. You can be 100% confident in receiving our company’s top-notch college paper writing service because we have only seasoned experts on board. Thus, we never experience emergencies like a writer’s inability to finish the paper on time, critical errors in interpreting the prompt, or grave grammar or syntax errors in the ready text. This way, you can be sure of the quality of the resulting product and submit it to your professor without worries. There’s no chance that our paper writer will submit poor-quality or plagiarized work, as the drafts pass through several checks before their delivery to the client. First, an editor reviews the assignment for consistency with the prompt, general quality, and readability. Second, a QA department member runs a plag check for every document to guarantee that the paper is fully original and ready for submission. Thus, you always receive the final variant of your assignment free from any errors, typos, or unoriginal fragments. We have set many instruments for checking the candidates’ credentials, diplomas, and portfolio samples in an effort to guarantee that only professional essay writers are welcomed to the team. Qualified HR managers and recruiters scan all documents and hold face-to-face interviews, either personally or online, to determine whether the contenders can fit our company’s writing family well. We value many soft skills besides writing excellence, so writers need to prove that they are a good match for the company in a variety of ways by showing their outstanding academic writing work and revealing such qualities as leadership, punctuality, communication skills, and academic integrity. As soon as you decide to use our paper writing services, you don’t need to master rocket science. The process is very simple and straightforward, with little input on your part. Here are a couple of steps you should take to delegate an academic assignment to our professionals. The first point of contact is the ordering form. You can either fill it out at once and send us an inquiry or send a note to one of our managers, like “please write an essay for me.” A manager will respond in minutes, giving you clear instructions and providing a rough estimate of the order’s price based on your general requirements. When filling out the form, you should indicate the deadline for your order, the number of pages you need, the referencing style, the complexity level, and the subject/topic of your task. Our calculator will produce a more precise calculation for your assignment based on these input details. Now that the calculations are done, and you’re okay with the final quote, you should go on to produce the payment. We work with several payment gateways to guarantee flexibility for our customers, so you can check the list and choose a method that works best for you. Once you choose the preferred payment method, you will be prompted to checkout, where you should cover 100% of the order’s cost. The basic value of our college paper writing service is regular communication between the client and the writer. If you have a small assignment and submit all the details at once, the writer may not bother you with plenty of questions or clarification requests. But if your work is extensive, and you’re interested in discussing the progress with your assigned expert, you will receive regular and informative communication from our writers. Feel free to ask your author questions, request progress reports, or instruct them on the drafts with constructive feedback. Your writer will send you the final product for review as soon as the paper is completed. At this point, it’s your task to dedicate some time to a thorough check for compliance and consistency, as our editors perform only technical polishing of texts. They may not know your professor’s requirements or your individual writing style, so your input is vital at this point. Besides, you should notify the author if you notice any grammar, syntax, or content errors and ask for free revisions. The author will perform all changes free of charge and within your given timeframe. Another indisputable advantage of our USA essay writer service is the ability to complete all orders promptly without giving false promises or undermining your deadlines. It’s such a shame to pay money for an essay or research paper in hopes of closing the task on time and to receive nothing but excuses in the end. We know how unjust it feels and have done everything possible to avoid such situations. How do we achieve timely completion of all assignments? We have curators assigned to teams of authors; they monitor every writer’s performance on the tasks in progress and check up with them on whether they’re on track with an assignment. As soon as the early signs of delays or problems surface, they either assist the authors or reallocate the task early enough to complete the client’s order on time. This way, you are fully protected against emergencies and unexpected bottlenecks in the writer’s work. We monitor the situation and deliver completed texts ahead of the deadline to meet your expectations and ensure high grades. That’s why many loyal customers trust us and delegate even urgent, burning tasks to our team members. The benefit of any college essay writing service in USA is the ability to meet various clients’ needs without delays. We have a large set of projects at work every day, with some of them having extended deadlines of 10-14 days and others due in a couple of hours. Proper order and workload management take place in a sophisticated software system that allows us to avoid writer overload and bottlenecks in submission. So, you can always turn to us with a task of any urgency and complexity, knowing that it will be given enough attention and completed without delays. We can manage even orders with 3-6 hours of a deadline if you are crystal clear in your instructions and explain the task in detail. Thus, our experts often serve as your grade saviors, as they work in different time zones and can compose a great paper for you in the nighttime. We’re sure you’ll be relieved to know that using academic writing services USA is generally okay and it’s a common practice among students of all study levels. Here are the reasons pushing people to order their papers online instead of sitting down to write them on their own. Time is the most precious currency today, as most people lack the traditional 24 hours available in one calendar day. Regular students must attend lectures, do homework, study for independent projects, keep their room or apartment clean, buy and cook food, work part-time, and sleep well to restore their resources for the next day. Sometimes, students already have a family and need to care for their minor children. Thus, it’s always a life full of pressures and competing priorities. Amid the unending cycle of chores and due tasks, you can hire EssayUSA experts and relieve the academic workload, giving yourself and your family a few days of rest and warm communication. Students are only in the process of mastering their professional disciplines, so they often fail to embrace some topic or task properly. The risk of doing the guesswork and submitting an off-topic assignment is too high, so why not entrust the task to people who know for sure what it should be like? EssayUSA pros are well-versed in all academic tasks and will surely write what your professor will like. It often happens that the fast-moving, stressful college life places you into the conditions of chronic stress or burnout. You can identify that state by seeing no motivation and inspiration for the next assignment or when trying to compose a simple essay and having no success with writing even a couple of lines. In this case, there’s no sense in torturing yourself and squeezing creativity; ask our writers to do the task and take a breath of fresh air, resuming your resourcefulness and interest in studies. So, as you can see, EssayUSA can become your safe bet when you are looking for an essay writer service and think, “who can write my essay the way I would do it?” Besides affordable prices and numerous free extra essay writing services you get at zero cost, you are introduced to a large professional team of experts with years of daily writing experience. This way, you can learn from the best and hone your writing skills day by day, looking at the examples of well-written assignments we deliver upon your orders. Our company prioritizes timeliness and quality, and our loyal clients return with more assignments as they trust our approach and like working with professionals.

If u was in this mans situation I would just stand there and follow them for no reason and I have no idea why did this person do this and on second thought I would probably just be upset and then after I’m done being upset and there’s a whole tank in front on me I’m getting out of there because I don’t want to get hurt. When I first saw this and this was my first time seeing this I thought he would get hurt because it’s a tank and tanks are very big and huge and has lots of guns on/in it such as the main weapon called the big cannon on the front and has some room inside and has a machine gun and other more things I think and I also don’t know lots about tanks. I I’m very thankful that the person didn’t get hurt and if so that would be bad and the person that hurt I think might go to jail because that person didn’t do anything and anything bad. When I first saw the video I thought it was a cartoon movie or something because I have never saw it but I heard of it but I just forgot and I think there’s a cartoon tv show or a movie and I will be checking that out. That was very brave of him doing that because that would be pretty scary if a tank is right in front of you and would have gone a very bad situation if the person is going through a bad day and might have or can’t control themselves and it would turned up bad. @ Logan, I like that you posting very detailed posts, but most of this is copied and pasted off of Wikipedia. Please write in your own words next time! If I was tank man the first thing that is going throu my head is ""pleas stop pleas stop"" then when the tankes stop i\'d bee like ""go a way!"" and the when the tank tries to go around i\'m thinking no way. @Harmon- I think you need to elaborate more details as per the criteria. @harmon, I love your sentences but you have a error. It is please. You forgot to put a e in please. Great job. Ninth... What do you mean by the tank ""stepping"" on you? There are also a few spelling errors in your PAR. You should read it over and revise it. :) By the way, in the end, the tank had led away by serval men nearby. One of them is wearing white and rides a bicycle, others had those blue coats on too. So I had an inference that they the characters in the Forbidden City? Since I still remember there are tanks and people riding the bicycle on the cover of Forbidden City. I’ve compared it with the video, it’s sooooo similar?! (I’m not sure if it’s actually the way I’m thinking but yeah, that’s my connection and inferences to the story.) @ Wendy - Great job! I really see how much you have improved on your writing from the start. :) Though, I think it can improved more! Remember that it is a comma after the day in a date, not another period. (E.g. Jan. 25, 2019) Also, remember that you cannot combine two sentence with just a comma. Add a conjunction word if needed. Otherwise, I liked reading your writing a lot!

This error was generated by Mod_Security.', 'As Southern Californians, we are fortunate to live in a region with unrivaled natural resources and beauty. Within a short walk or drive from our homes, we find a vast array of indigenous flora and fauna and a diverse tableau of microclimates. Yet for all the natural beauty that surrounds us, it is no surprise to learn that today’s children are spending increasingly less time outdoors playing and interacting with nature. A constant din of news reports laments increasing rates of childhood obesity, which has in fact doubled in the past 20 years. We hear mounting concerns over the adverse effects of overused technology. And according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children spend an astounding average of seven hours per day on entertainment media including TV, computers, phones and other electronic devices. In fact, from 1981 to 1997 children’s free playtime dropped 25%. Generation Z is expected to be the first generation to have a shorter lifespan than preceding generations. Anyone over 40 will reminisce about the days when kids played outside, unsupervised, until the street lights came on. Those days are certainly gone. But in spite of the cautionary tales of today’s children being overscheduled, stressed out and removed from the natural world, Millennials and Gen Z are actually far more environmentally aware and concerned then prior generations, which is hopeful. So we took a look around our own community and found inspiring stories of kids learning about nature and wildlife while very young, and teens translating that knowledge into action during young adulthood. Twin brothers Austin Nash and Brandon Nash developed a love of the wilderness and conservation as young boys while traveling to national parks with their parents. Experiencing firsthand the majestic beauty of these national treasures fostered an early and deep appreciation of nature in both brothers. As Brandon shares, “We realized how special those places are and how important it is to protect them. We wanted to get involved with conservation, and since we can’t go to national parks every weekend and we live in a beautiful peninsula, we realized there were opportunities to get involved in our own backyard.” A few years ago the Nash brothers, along with friends in their Los Hermanos volunteer group, participated in an event at White Point Nature Preserve organized by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy (PVPLC). Impressed by the overall event and especially the PVPLC team, the brothers were hooked and knew they had found the right volunteer organization for them. The experience was so positive, the brothers said the day went by in a blur and didn’t feel like work at all. They have continued volunteering with PVPLC at many events, but their favorite PVPLC program is Adopt a Plot. “We adopted a PVPLC plot at Agua Amarga Canyon in Rancho Palos Verdes,” explains Austin. “My brother and I lead a group of our friends from our Los Hermanos volunteer group. We, along with our friends, tend to our plot almost every weekend, though we do so more frequently in the summer months. In the area of our plot there were already some native plants in place. Our job is to take care of native plants, especially watering in dry months. And when it rains, then we’re weeding out invasive plants. Recently we planted four new baby willow trees in the plot. On our plot there is a riparian section with a seasonal stream with a square piece of land adjacent to it. We’ve planted native plants in a grid fashion for intense restoration of the natural habitat. Our plot keeps expanding.” Austin and Brandon are now part of the PVPLC Team Leader Program. “It’s more beneficial to the organization for us to help the volunteers instead of being another person pulling up weeds,” Austin says. “So when there is a larger-scale volunteer event—for example, recently for MLK day—I’ll work with the volunteer coordinator, and I’m assigned to an area and to lead a group of volunteers. I’m there to answer questions and to be working too, but also watching their work to ensure they’re not pulling out the wrong plants.” Brandon adds, “We did a Team Leader training to further our familiarity with native plants and how to operate the volunteer program. So we both work as team leaders on the volunteer days, which rotate between the different PVPLC preserves.” Through their volunteer work with PVPLC, Brandon and Austin have developed a variety of skills, seen tangible results of their efforts, honed their leadership capabilities and realized the value and satisfaction that comes with inspiring others to do good. What is perhaps even more significant: The Nash brothers credit their work with PVPLC with helping them discover their individual callings. Austin has found his true passion in science and plans to pursue a career in biology and environmental science. He has already attended two prestigious research field expeditions in Yosemite and the Galapagos Islands and is currently applying for spots in three expeditions, including one in Boulder and another in Antarctica. Austin and his friend Jonathan Wang founded a club at PVHS called the Green School Initiative, which educates and encourages its members to be more environmentally conscience citizens. It offers students who are passionate about being green a safe place to express that passion. The club also initiates ways for PVHS to make green changes on campus and improve its sustainability practices. Some of these changes include water refilling stations, using rain collection barrels and installing solar panels on campus. As a result of the Green School Initiative, PVHS was recently named a Green Ribbon School. Austin is also an avid nature photographer, and his work has won awards and been featured in photo exhibitions. Ultimately, he aspires to become a researcher or professor. Brandon has developed a passion for the business of conservation and aspires to pursue a career in an arena that will influence global policies for sustainability. Whether he ultimately works in the public or private sector, his dream is to develop a global standard supported by government and NGO entities that can slow and eventually stop climate change. In this pursuit, Brandon is taking science and business courses and is involved with PVHS Model U.N. to hone his policy-making skills. He believes if all entities get on board, we can truly effect change on a global scale. As part of Model U.N., Brandon created a website for the group. He is currently treasurer, and next year he will serve as secretary general. Austin’s and Brandon’s passion and activism have garnered many well-deserved honors and accolades, for which they are humbled and proud. Among these, the Nash brothers were chosen to be the keynote speakers at this year’s Palos Verdes Pastoral—the exclusive annual fundraising event to benefit the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy. Held at Terranea, the intimate, sold-out event welcomed 200 PVPLC top donors for a handcrafted, organic, chef-prepared, farm-to-table dinner. After the Nash brothers delivered their speech, they were approached by many attendees who thanked them for their dedication to protecting and enhancing Palos Verdes. Guests spoke of being inspired by the Nash brothers’ work and pleased to see that today’s youth are willing to take up the cause. Others expressed their pleasure in knowing their donations are being well utilized. “Teens get a bad rap,” Austin explains, “but the guests at the Pastoral—after hearing our speech and about the work we do—can take comfort that our generation will be the change they want to see.” Brandon adds, “We gave them hope.” Research shows a correlation between early exposure to nature and wildlife and an enhanced empathy, appreciation and respect for the natural world and all living beings. It is also thought that the earlier in one’s youth this exposure occurs, the more profound and enduring the connection to nature will be. Sunny Dallafior and her Traveling Nature Class are proof positive that creating a rapport between children and animals can have a meaningful and lasting effect. Miss Sunny, as kids fondly call her, shares her love of all creatures with groups of curious children in a hands-on, symbiotic and controlled environment. The Traveling Nature Class brings a menagerie of live animals into classrooms and other interactive settings, giving children an opportunity to see and touch a wide variety of unusual species while learning about the importance of our ecosystem and the unique role each living being plays in our world. One of the primary goals of the Traveling Nature Class is to teach children to respect animals and not to fear them. By understanding the unique characteristics and idiosyncrasies of individual species—while also learning how to safely and properly handle each animal—children broaden their appreciation for the animal kingdom and our remarkable planet. At each Traveling Nature Class, Sunny brings a wide variety of critters that are appropriate for the age group. Animals presented during a class may include hedgehogs, chinchillas, a ferret, longhaired rabbits, a miniature pig, bearded dragons, a tegu, skinks, an eclectus parrot, and a variety of frogs, snakes and lizards. Sunny can also customize her class to address specific scientific subjects currently being studied by a class such as invertebrates … humorously nicknamed The Bug Program. The Traveling Nature Class visits schools throughout Southern California. Based in the South Bay, Sunny conducts annual classes in several local schools. She also visits campuses as far away as Pasadena, Palmdale/Lancaster and throughout Orange County. Sunny primarily works with preschool and elementary school children, but middle and high schools also bring in her class. She also offers classes at local libraries and many private events. On the day we visited the Traveling Nature Class, Sunny was working in a Manhattan Beach preschool. With her guidance, the 3- to 4-year-old students were unafraid of these unusual (and often villainized) creatures. Many kids had snakes draped around their arms and shoulders, while lizards, frogs, chinchillas and bunnies rested calmly in other kids’ arms and laps. It is inspiring to see the unbridled enthusiasm and curiosity of these young children as they experience interacting with these unique animals up close. As Sunny explains, “The biggest benefit of our program is that we get kids interested in all living creatures. They learn to care about other beings and understand that we share this planet and that human actions can have an effect on other species. It changes their viewpoint and subsequent behavior and encourages them to appreciate nature and want to conserve our precious earth.” She goes on to say, “When working with children and animals, I’m often reminded of the famous Lorax quote: ‘Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.’” Much like the Traveling Nature Class teaches children about terrestrial and amphibious creatures, The SEA Lab in Redondo Beach—a marine education and science center—teaches kids about marine life and coastal conservation, also through a hands-on interactive experience. Located near the Redondo Harbor, The SEA Lab welcomes approximately 10,000 kids each year to its facility located steps away from the Pacific Ocean. At The SEA Lab, visitors can tour an exhibition on all things water—from osmosis to droughts to variations between saltwater and freshwater sea life. The facility has open tanks with a wide variety of local marine animals as well as aquariums with underwater ecosystems on display. Many children visiting The SEA Lab come on field trips from schools throughout the Southland, typically in groups of 60 to 75 students. Their visit is divided into three 45-minute activities, including a guided, hands-on tour of the facility where kids are able to touch sea animals; a beach exploration; and an instructional period specifically tailored to the grade level of the visiting students. According to The SEA Lab director Maria Madrigal, some groups of students come from inland schools. It’s not unusual for their trip to SEA Lab to be their first time seeing the ocean. In addition to field trips, homeschooled children visit The SEA Lab to meet their science curriculum. The SEA Lab also plays host to private events such as birthday parties. One of The SEA Lab’s more popular programs is summer camp, where kids can study and interact with marine science in a more in-depth, specialized educational program. Since 1997, The SEA Lab has been operated and managed by the Los Angeles Conservation Corps. The SEA Lab team includes four full-time staff members and dozens of local volunteers. As a part of the LA Conservation Corps, a group of 15 to 20 interns play a crucial role in handling the daily operations at The SEA Lab. The Corps interns are comprised mostly of college students pursuing careers in marine biology and other relevant fields of science. “Many of our interns choose to work at The SEA Lab because of a love of the ocean and sea life, along with a desire to work with children,” Maria shares. “They want to inspire future generations and teach them about respecting the ocean and the critical importance of conservation.” Numerous studies have shown that when a love of nature is imbued early in one’s youth—much like it was for Austin and Brandon—it often develops into a full-blown passion by young adulthood, inspiring more dedicated pursuit. The 515 students at Environmental Charter High School (ECHS) in Lawndale are emblematic of that passion. At ECHS and its two sister middle schools in Gardena and Inglewood, students opt out of attending a traditional public school to pursue a more academically challenging curriculum that utilizes the environment as a base to develop and enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills. ECHS offers students a rigorous college-prep curriculum, requiring each student to complete the A-G coursework required for acceptance into UC and CSU systems. Many students at ECHS aspire to continue their studies at universities offering degrees in environmental studies or to pursue green careers. Opened in 2000, Environmental Charter High School is the brainchild of founder and executive director Alison Suffet Diaz, an attorney-turned-teacher whose groundbreaking idea to start a charter school teaching academics through the prism of the environment came to her while working in the classroom. “When I was teaching,” Alison explains, “I discovered that if I could get kids to care about local issues and they in turn could see that they had the power to do something about those issues and be the change that they aspired to be, they were willing to do the work, put in the hours and take the classes needed to achieve their goals.” ECHS is a public high school serving grades 9–12. Like so many outstanding charter schools in LA and throughout California, there are far more students who desire to attend ECHS than there are eligible spots in the school. Thus admission to ECHS is offered through a lottery system. Each year approximately 300 students apply for 130 incoming freshman spots. There are typically between 100 to 150 students wait-listed to attend ECHS each year. The ECHS campus is often referred to as a “living textbook.” It is quite literally an outdoor classroom … a living, breathing science lab where students are engaged and empowered to implement their ideas for sustainability and see the tangible results of their green projects. Students feel responsible and invested in their school. ECHS proudly and enthusiastically offers student-guided tours of the campus. These tours are typically led by top students. The day of our tour we met Carolyn Lam, who fortuitously moved to California from Virginia in ninth grade and won the lottery to attend ECHS. Carolyn is a Green Ambassador and is currently writing her senior thesis on pollution. She won an Air Quality Management District Award for her work. At the entrance of ECHS is the amphitheatre, made of urbanite—recycled concrete taken from other locations on the campus. The urbanite was then broken into smaller pieces and placed strategically to create the welcoming student gathering area. On rainy days, the center of the campus would often flood. ECHS students came up with the idea to create a living stream to handle excess water flow when it’s raining and provide a source for conducting water experiments year-round. The school has a living wall and a solar-powered greenhouse. There are organic fruit trees spread throughout the campus that double as “seasonal snack machines,” where students can eat the fruit they want if it’s in season. Bunnies and chickens, cared for by students, roam the school. There is a cistern, rain collection barrels and swales, along with the dry riverbed to prevent excess runoff and recycle water more efficiently. ECHS promotes composting, recycling and minimizing waste. There are also systems in place to reduce electricity and water consumption. ECHS has an on-campus lab with 3-D printers where students are currently designing and building tiny homes and an on-campus, student-run store selling a variety of sustainable items. The school also has its own bike shop, of which the students are especially proud. At the shop, students are able to rent bikes for a minimal fee, and they are also encouraged to build and repair bikes—adding to their learning experience. ECHS is exceptionally proud of its Green Ambassador Program. Originally started to mentor and train its own students and staff, the program has now become a model for other green schools around the country and offers training and development to instructors from other schools through the Green Ambassador Program. Perhaps what is most outstanding about ECHS is its impressive graduation rates and its outstanding ability to prepare students for future success. Located in South LA, ECHS primarily educates children from underserved communities. More than 75% of the student body qualify for free or reduced-price meals, and the diverse makeup of the student population is approximately 68% Hispanic, 20% African American, 6% Asian and 4% Caucasian. Many of ECHS’ graduates are the first to graduate high school in their families. A notable 98% of ECHS graduating students have completed the required coursework for admission to a four-year university or college (the California statewide average is 35%). Approximately 78% of ECHS graduates go on to attend college. It is this extraordinary success in inspiring and educating children that has garnered ECHS numerous awards and accolades, including being named in the top 3% of U.S. public high schools by U.S. News & World Report, receiving a California Gold Ribbon School award and a National Green Ribbon School award and Green Leadership award, to name but a few. Alison, who also serves on the board of Green Schools National Network, is certainly proud of the numerous accolades the Environmental Charter Schools have received. Yet she sites that the most essential element to making the schools so effective is that they create a positive and collaborative learning environment. “Community is critical for the success of any school,” she says. “We are creating a family and a community in our schools. If you build a community and the kids feel a part of that, and the teachers feel supported and that they are making a difference—which they are … well then, that’s the magic.” Songs that give off superbloom energy.

Who took the video?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZXxfEcwkJ8 Ross Cowan Tim Veater you might be on to something about ugly old folk...ManageLikeShow more reactions · Reply · 9hTim VeaterTim Veater Victims must be photogenic it seems! On a somewhat more serious note, am I right in thinking you are a medically qualified doctor? The reason I pose this rather personal question (I hope you will not be offended) is that if I am correct you must be somewhat aware of standard post-death procedures, particularly following tragedy or homicide. There are many elements to the Florida School shooting that simply cannot be made to fit and reconcile the various accounts and yet the media appear totally oblivious of these and fail to pursue them. It is a brave and perhaps foolish man who would challenge the fact of 17 young lives lost, when in a small intimate community they must be well known and grieved over, so other than a sophisticated deception, we must accept these tragic deaths occurred. Nevertheless I cannot help noting the speed with which the crime scene containing muliple dead and injured was cleared and apparently re-opened, the necessary forensic post-mortems carried out, the funeral arrangements organised, all to allow at least two victims to be buried (Alyssa Alhadeff and Meadow Pollack according to the London Times) only two days after the event on the 16th February, 2018! This seems incredibly speedy but is it exceptional - even questionable? Other funerals took place the following Monday. I am sure you will have experience in this area and have an opinion and I would be most interested to hear it. Tim Veater Can I add a few further points/questions that trouble me, for your respected observations? It is claimed that Cruz had only 9 minutes in the building. In this time he entered the building carrying his gun and back pack unchallenged by anyone although he had been banned; set off the fire alarm; moved to the toilets where he unpacked his weapon and allegedly told others to leave as it ""was going to get messy"" yet again no one challenged him; he then started shooting into classrooms on the ground, first and second floors, apparently leaving weapon and back pack there. Then nonchallantly walked back down the stairs and out of the building chatting to an aquaintance who reports nothing untoward about him. (Incidentally this version clashes with the version that he entered and immediately ascended the staircase to the top floor) The Times reports he fired ""about 150"" bullets and that 120 were left in his back. This of course would require multiple reloading depending on the capacity of the magazine (up to 30) I suppose this might be just possible in the time available, but it clashes directly with the account that the shooting occurred when students RETURNED from the fire; or that shooting was happening as Cruz left with the friend; or the Hogg video claiming they were hiding in a class room date stamped four hours previous; or the fact that young people were still inside on \'lock-down\' two hours AFTER the attack and Cruz was already under arrest! Tim Veater So we must assume that the dead and injured were left for about two hours before ""troops"" released them. Of the 17 taken to hospital, two allegedly died there, contributing to the total of 17 that died. This means that 15 died at the scene either inside or out, every one of which could not be moved until all the forensic evidence had been recorded. If carried out thoroughly and systematically this would be a time-consuming process carried out only by specially trained experts. Every one of the hundred and fifty bullets would have to be accounted for, logged and catalogued including trajectories, all of course photographed. Is there any evidence this was done? Tim Veater Then we come to the bodies themselves. Each the result of a despicable criminal act must have required detailed autopsy to determine cause of death and the description of the actual injuries inflicted. Who were the pathologists employed in this task, again very time consuming and following strict guidelines. Yet despite 17 of these, within less than two days, at least two victims were released and buried. In such a notorious case, wouldn\'t you expect the Coroner would wish to retain bodies until at least he was satisfied all due process had completed? Of course all this amazing speed of process is complimented by the speed with which Cruz is identified as the killer, located, arrested, hospitalised, arraigned and admits to the deed. Conversely, it contrasts with all outrageous failings of the FBI, Police and school authorities that allowed the massacre to take place.

The Voice is an American reality television singing competition broadcast on NBC. Based on the original The Voice of Holland, the concept of the series is to find new singing talent (solo or duets) contested by aspiring singers, age 15 or over,[2] drawn from public auditions. The winner is determined by television viewers voting by telephone, Internet, SMS text, and iTunes Store purchases of the audio-recorded artists' vocal performances. They receive $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group for winning the competition. The series employs a panel of four coaches who critique the artists' performances. Each coach guides their team of selected artists through the remainder of the season. They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach. The original coaching panel consisted of Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green. Shakira and Usher took the places of Aguilera and Green in seasons four and six. Similarly, Pharrell Williams and Gwen Stefani replaced Shakira and Usher in season seven, with Williams permanently replacing Green in the eighth season.

(Get more Season 14 details.) The two chairs between Adam and Blake have been rotating since Season 4, but this bromantic duo has refused to give up their seats. Considering they are the only coaches to compete in every season, it is no surprise that Blake has won the most championships with six, followed by Adam with three. But is it finally time for these two to take a break? Or would “The Voice” hit the ultimate sour note without them? Vote in our poll below. For the first three seasons Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green held down the center chairs before both decided to take a hiatus. Usher and Shakira joined the panel for Season 4 and Season 6, with Christina coming back for Seasons 5, 8 and 10 and CeeLo returning only once more for Season 5. Other coaches to rotate through were\xa0Gwen Stefani (Seasons 7, 9 and 12), Pharrell Williams (Seasons 7-10), Miley Cyrus (Seasons 11 and 13), Alicia Keys (Seasons 11, 12 and 14), Jennifer Hudson (Season 13) and Kelly Clarkson (Season 14). In his 13 seasons as a coach, Blake has mentored the winning contestant nearly 50 percent of the time. His six title-holders were Jermaine Paul (Season 2), Cassadee Pope (Season 3), Danielle Bradbery (Season 4), Craig Wayne Boyd (Season 7), Sundance Head (Season 11) and Chloe Kohanski (Season 13). Adam’s three wins have come more sporadically after he coached the series’ first champion, Javier Colon (Season 1) followed by Tessanne Chin (Season 5) and Jordan Smith (Season 9).

It is based on the Dutch version which was created by John de Mol and is also a part of a wider international franchise. The show employs a board of four judges who critique the performances of the contestants. Each of them also has teams of their own that they are supposed to guide. The team consists of members they wish to select their students for the entire season. They compete to make sure that their team members win the competition and thus they are made the winning coach. The first season of The Voice aired on 6th June 2015. The judges for this season was renowned singers from the Bollywood industry like Mika Singh, Shaan, Himesh Reshammiya, and Sunidhi Chauhan who were also the coaches. The host was Karan Tacker who is a pretty famous face on the small screen. The format of the show had around three phases which included blind auditions as the first, battleground as the second and live performance shows as the final one. The stage of Blind Auditions was where the contestants were to sing in front of the judges and each coach could select around 14 candidates. If more than one coach selects the candidate, which was done only on the basis of the voice of the candidate, that person had the liberty to choose their coach. In the Battle Ground stage, the coaches had to develop their team members and train them in various ways. The coaches would have two members from their respective teams battling each other by singing the same song and then they had to choose who would move to the next level. Further, from the individual performances, they could select which member they wanted to take to the stage of a\xa0live show. Here the rest of the members had to perform solo and entertain the audience and judges. After four rounds, each coach could select contestants that would go to the semi-final round. In semi-finals, two members of each team would have a face-off and the winner among them would be decided on the basis of public votes and points given by judges. In the Finals, the winner is chosen amongst all the four contestants from each time which is on the results of the voting after the live performance. Coach Shaan was the winner of the season with his contestant Pawandeep Rajan who defeated Parampara Thakur, Deepesh Rahi, and Rishabh Chaturvedi in the finals. This season received many positive comments and was appreciated by the viewers a lot.

every how many years do cicadas come out,"[""Lawn insects in Tennessee can be troublesome for homeowners. Signs that your lawn may be infested with insects include patches of discolored grass, thinning or stunted growth, and yellow or brown patches. Common lawn insects in Tennessee include fire ants, armyworms, cutworms, yellow jackets, hunting billbugs, chinch bugs, white grubs, and more! Army worms are another destructive lawn insect found in Tennessee. They often feed on the leaves of grass and can quickly destroy a lawn if left untreated. Army worms are most active during the warmer months when they can be seen swarming in large numbers. Cutworms are similar to army worms, as they feed on the leaves of grass as well. They are nocturnal, so they usually come out at night and can be seen crawling around in search of food. Fortunately, both can also be controlled with insecticides or parasitic nematodes. Fire ants are considered one of the most common and destructive lawn insects in Tennessee. Fire ants have spread from the extreme southern states to the Mid-South, which includes Memphis. The Southern fire ant is aggressive, and its sting can produce reactions ranging from irritation and vomiting to even more severe symptoms. They attack both people and animals. It can cause damage to trees, shrubs, air-conditioning units, and even telephone wires. Therefore, it is important to take measures to control the fire ants on your lawn. Green June beetles look similar to Japanese Beetles and feed on the leaves of grass, leaving large dead spots. To control this insect, use an insecticide specifically designed for green June beetle larvae or apply beneficial nematodes to your lawn. Proper mowing practices can also help to reduce populations by removing their food source. Grubs are the larvae of beetles, and they feed on grassroots. They can cause considerable damage to your lawn if left unchecked, so it's important to take action as soon as you notice them. Regularly inspect your lawn for grubs in late summer or early fall, and apply an insecticide if necessary. Alternatively, natural predators such as birds and certain insects can be encouraged to visit your lawn to help keep the grub population in check. Finally, aerating and fertilizing your lawn regularly will help keep it healthy, making it less attractive to grubs. Hunting Billbugs are a species of beetle found in Memphis, TN. They have long bodies and pointed heads, and their shells are dark brown or black with yellowish-brown stripes. Hunting Billbugs feed on the roots of turfgrass and can cause extensive damage to lawns if left unchecked. To control them, use insecticides or baits specifically designed for beetles. You can also remove the adults by hand or use a vacuum cleaner to suck up any larvae. Be sure to dispose of them carefully, so they don't return to your yard. Leafhoppers and spittlebugs feed on the sap of grass blades, creating a frothy “spit” that protects them from predators. To reduce populations, introduce beneficial insects into your lawn and avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides. Proper mowing practices can also help to keep these insects away. Mole crickets can cause extensive damage to lawns, with their tunneling activities creating large dead spots. To reduce populations, use an insecticide specifically designed for mole crickets or apply beneficial nematodes to your lawn. You can also attract birds that feed on these insects and keep your grass mowed high to make it difficult for them to tunnel. Sod webworms can cause significant damage to lawns by creating patches of dead grass as they feed on the foliage. To reduce populations, introduce beneficial parasitic wasps into your lawn or use insecticides specifically designed for this insect. Additionally, avoid over-fertilizing your lawn and maintain proper soil moisture levels, as this can encourage the growth of webworms. Yellow Jackets are a large, aggressive species of wasp found in Memphis, TN. They are often mistaken for bees due to their yellow and black stripes, but they can be identified by their long bodies and pointed wings. Yellow Jackets have a painful sting and will aggressively defend their nests if disturbed. To control them, use insecticides or traps specifically designed for wasps. Chinch bugs are small insects that feed on turfgrass roots. They can cause extensive damage to lawns, turning the grass yellow and resulting in dead patches. To control them, use insecticides specifically designed for chinch bugs or neem oil. In addition, you can reduce their numbers by removing any thatch buildup in your lawn and maintaining adequate moisture levels in the soil. Mulching also helps to suppress chinch bug populations."", '', '', 'Periodical cicadas\xa0spend most of their lives underground feeding on xylem fluids from the roots of deciduous forest trees in the eastern United States. After 13 or 17 years, mature cicada nymphs emerge at any given locality, synchronously and in tremendous numbers. Royal Ruckus\xa0has been underground\xa0for many years, many unaware of their continued existence. Chunjay and Flatline have each\xa0been very busy though, learning and growing in this life, always\xa0becoming. Cicadas are among the greatest ruckus-making insects known to man, and a swarm of them can produce sounds up to 120 decibels. That’s louder than a rock concert, and comparable to the noise from a chainsaw. Cicadas gravitate to other ruckusy summer objects, like lawnmowers, because female cicadas confusedly mistake them for singing males, and male cicadas will follow in order to continue wooing the females. Ruckus (noun, ruck·us [rəkəs]) is\xa0a disturbance or commotion. A “royal ruckus” is a large-scale commotion, fuss, or noise.\xa0This description characterizes the musical accomplishments\xa0of the duo, Chunjay and Flatline. Despite\xa0such a prolonged developmental phase,\xa0adult cicadas are active for only a short time. The males aggregate into chorus centers and attract females to mate with. Within two months of the original emergence, the life-cycle is complete, new\xa0eggs have been laid, and the adult cicadas are gone for another 13 or 17 years. The Summer of the Cicadas is a two-part eclectic hip-hop project by Royal Ruckus and friends that was released in 2017. Royal Ruckus is like the cicada; they have been underground for many years, not to be heard from or seen. They have since emerged from the\xa0ground to sing and make a ruckus, and before you know it, will cease their singing and return to the ground.

There is a genus of cicada in North America (Magicicada) which spend most of their 13 or 17-year lives underground. After 13 or 17 years, mature cicada nymphs emerge at any given locality, synchronously and in tremendous numbers. After such a prolonged developmental phase, the adults are active for about 4 to 6 weeks. Within two months of the original emergence, the life cycle is complete, the eggs have been laid and the adult cicadas are gone for another 13 or 17 years. Time after time something disturbs this cycle of individual cicadas and a single cicada can emerge from its safe-haven of underground out of this 17-year cycle and enter the brave new world without the company of any of it’s kind. If something should define lonely we think this is it. Happen to be at the east coast of North America? There is an emergence of cicadas happening right now and you can actually build a sensor to track cicadas at your location. Or just track them via online map. © Meliora Ltd.

The Academy was founded during the American Revolution by Founding Fathers John Adams, John Hancock, and other patriots. Image: Maria Mitchell and her brass telescope  Mitchell and her students used this telescope; now more than 150 years old, it remains among Vassar’s treasures. Matthew Vassar founded Vassar College in 1861, the second of the Seven Sisters schools to offer higher education strictly for women. In 1865, he appointed Maria Mitchell (1818-1889) the first person on the Vassar faculty. The well-known astronomer made the building of an observatory with living quarters for herself and her father a condition of her employment.   The first building to be completed at Vassar was the Maria Mitchell Observatory, where she used a 12-inch telescope, the third largest in the United States at the time. There, she held classes and worked with her students and conducted research by studying the surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn, and photographing stars, making her the first American woman to work as a professional astronomer. Science as a Female Profession By definition, a profession is a paid occupation, especially one that requires education and training. Female business owners probably have the longest histories as professional women. Colonial women entrepreneurs owned inns, taverns, and stores. The lively fancy of the youthful fair, would quickly catch a fondness for a science of such infinite variety – what a charming topic for conversation would this [scientific knowledge] afford in their social parties! And if we reflect how the various parts of natural science branch out into all the household and economical concerns, can we find any part of female education of greater import. The early education of children must generally fall on the mother, how important then, that she should be well informed in the history of Nature. However, women were excluded from education in the sciences; therefore, their contributions were limited. As late as the 1870s, the only profession open to women was as school teachers, which was perceived by society as an extension of traditional domestic roles. Martha Daniell Logan  Horticulturalist (1704-1779) Martha Daniell Logan was an early American botanist who exchanged seeds between the North American colonies and Britain. Born in St. Thomas Parish to a wealthy family, Martha Daniell’s father was a prominent merchant and governor of South Carolina. At age fourteen (1718) Martha married George Logan Jr. and moved to a plantation near Charleston, South Carolina, where she cared for her family of six children and began her botanical collections in the nearby woods. George Logan died in 1742 and the financial difficulties that followed spurred Martha Logan to begin writing a column called ‘Gardener’s Calendar’ for the South Carolina Gazette in 1751. Further money troubles caused her to sell her plantation in 1753. Logan then moved to Charleston, where she owned a nursery and sold rare seeds, roots, and plants for customers in the colonies and Britain. She was a major collector of plants endemic to the Carolinas. As time permitted, she delved more seriously into her studies of botany. Sow Celery, Cucumbers, Melons, Kidney-Beans, Spinage, Asparagus, Radish. Parsley, Lettice, to be transplanted in shady Places: they must be moved young and watered every Morning: Pond or Rain Water is the best. If the season does not prove too wet, this Month is best for planting all Sorts of Trees, except the Fig… Eighteenth-century Philadelphia botanist John Bartram met Logan during his southern tour in the 1760s, in a letter he paid her the compliment that she knew her horticulture well. Logan began to correspond with John Bartram; they exchanged samples and communicated regularly. Logan is best known for her interest in horticulture. Her letters demonstrate how knowledgeable she was and that she was part of a local network of fellow horticulturists, some of whom were women. Martha Daniell Logan died June 28, 1779 in Charleston at the age of 75. Eliza Lucas Pinckney  Botanist (1722-1793)  Eliza Lucas Pinkney was born in Antigua in the West Indies. Her father, British military officer George Lucas, moved the family to the British colony of South Carolina in 1738, hoping the climate would improve the health of Elizabeth’s mother, but she died soon after they arrived in America. George Lucas bought several plantations near Charleston, one with 600 acres of land and another with 1,500 acres. In 1739, George Lucas had to return to his military post in Antigua to deal with the political conflict between England and Spain. At age sixteen, Eliza was left to care for her siblings and run three plantations. Eliza’s letters to her father demonstrated that she was acting as head of the family and managing the plantations. In his letters, George encouraged his daughter to look into different types of crops which might be exported outside of the state. Eliza considered the indigo plant, which produced a natural blue dye, one of these crops; it was highly prized in the developing textile industry in England because of the difficulty in growing it. George sent seeds of the plant to his daughter and Eliza looked for ways to make it grow in the climate and soil of South Carolina. Before the year was out, she was cultivating improved strains of the indigo plant. Eliza Lucas Pinckney changed agriculture in colonial South Carolina and developed indigo as one of its most important cash crops. Jane Colden  Botanist (1724-1766) Physician Cadwallader Colden believed that his daughter’s love for adornment would make flowers and plants an attractive subject for her to study. He wrote to the Dutch naturalist Jan Frederik Grovonius in 1755: I thought that Botany is an Amusement which may be made agreeable for the Ladies who are often at a loss to fill up their time, if it could be made agreeable to them. Their natural curiosity and the pleasure they take in the beauty and variety of dress seems to fit them for it. His daughter, Jane Colden, became America’s first female botanist. Jane mastered the complex Latin plant classification system developed by Carl Linnaeus, and by 1757, she had compiled a catalog of more than 300 local plants. Jane both sketched living plants and created ink transfers from dried plants, and noted medicinal uses of plants. Jane Colden exchanged seeds with leading American botanists such as Alexander Garden of South Carolina. When she discovered a new plant, she named it the gardenia in his honor. Records also indicated that European botanists including Carl Linnaeus himself were aware of her work, but the contributions of female scientists were often overlooked. Jane married a local physician in her late 30s and died during childbirth at the age of 41. Margaretta Morris Entomologist (1797–1867) Margaretta Hare Morris was a pioneer in the field of entomology, the study of insects, and the first practicing woman entomologist in the United States. She gained great respect in her field and wrote numerous papers that were delivered by male colleagues at conferences and scientific societies, which women were not allowed to attend. Morris had no formal education and lived in the same house in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia most of her life and attended scientific lectures with her mother. Using bell jars for raising insects and her backyard as a laboratory, Morris made significant contributions to fundamental problems in entomology. She studied the life cycles of insects that threatened crops, and therefore, the economy of the young country. Morris studied the habits of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor, which was a significant pest of cereal crops including wheat, barley and rye. Though a native of Asia it was transported into Europe and later into North America, supposedly in the straw bedding of Hessian troops during the American Revolution. Margaretta Morris also studied the periodical cicadas and fungi as botanical pests. Magicicada is the genus of the seventeen-year periodical cicadas of eastern North America. They are sometimes called locusts, which is a misnomer. Magicicada spend most of their seventeen years underground feeding on fluids from the roots of deciduous trees, after which mature cicada nymphs emerge in great numbers. Adults are active for four to six weeks. Within two months, the life cycle is complete, the eggs have been laid and the adult cicadas are gone for another seventeen years. Morris concluded that these flies laid their eggs in the grain rather than the stalk as had been previously thought. Her findings were important to agriculture. An interesting note about Margaretta Morris: Charles Darwin corresponded with a broad network of naturalists and relied heavily on their expertise. This circle of scientific colleagues were not only men but quite a few women, including  Mary Treat, Lydia Becker, Carolina Dodel Port, Mary Barber and Margaretta Morris. I do not want to leave Philadelphia without having made the acquaintance of a distinguished entomologist, Miss Morris known [for her] observations on the Cicada septendecim [Pharoah Cicada] the Baridius tripunctatus [Tobacco and Solanum Weevil], etc. It was Mr. Dr. Elwyn, who was kind enough to introduce me to this lady, where I spent a very interesting morning. Motschulsky was well known and well traveled, and he often sought out other entomologists during his travels. His visit with Margaretta Morris indicates that she was well known in entomological circles. Well-known journals published Morris’ research, and her correspondence indicates that she kept in contact with other workers in the field, including collectors.

what are the causes of industrial revolution in england,"['The Industrial Revolution was a major shift of technological, socioeconomic, and cultural conditions that occurred in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in some Western countries. It began in Britain and spread throughout the world, a process that continues as industrialization. The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human social history, comparable to the invention of farming or the rise of the first city-states; almost every aspect of daily life and human society was, eventually, in some way influenced by it. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the nineteenth century, eventually affecting most of the world. The impact of this change on society was enormous.[1] ""What caused the Industrial Revolution?"" remains the most important unanswered question in social science. The term ""Industrial Revolution"" applied to technological change was common in the 1830s. Louis-Auguste Blanqui in 1837 spoke of la révolution industrielle. Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of ""an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society."" The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen, between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the century. Credit for popularizing the term may be given to historian Arnold Toynbee, whose lectures given in 1881 gave a detailed account of the process.[7] The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and remain a topic for debate, with some historians seeing the Revolution as an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the seventeenth century. As national border controls became more effective, the spread of disease was lessened, therefore preventing the epidemics common in previous times. The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly, leading to a larger workforce. The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labor-intensive, forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into cottage industry, for example weaving, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories. The colonial expansion of the seventeenth century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors, as is the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. Technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.[8] The historian, Lewis Mumford has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the early Middle Ages, much earlier than most estimates. He explains that the model for standardized mass production was the printing press and that ""the archetypal model for the [industrial era] was the clock."" He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that Medieval cities had at their center a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronization necessary for later, more physical manifestations such as the steam engine. The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them.[9] Governments\' grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system (the Statute of Monopolies 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialization are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewards inventors by allowing, e.g., James Watt to monopolize the production of the first steam engines, thereby enabling inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicizing ingenuity and rewarding inventors[10]. Watt\'s monopoly may have prevented other inventors, such as Richard Trevithick, William Murdoch or Jonathan Hornblower, from introducing improved steam engines thereby retarding the industrial revolution by up to 20 years[11]. One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution started in eighteenth century Europe and not in other parts of the world in the eighteenth century, particularly China, India, and the Middle East, or at other times like in Classical Antiquity[12] or the Middle Ages.[13] Numerous factors have been suggested, including ecology, government, and culture. Benjamin Elman argues that China was in a high level equilibrium trap in which the non-industrial methods were efficient enough to prevent use of industrial methods with high costs of capital. Kenneth Pomeranz, in the Great Divergence, argues that Europe and China were remarkably similar in 1700, and that the crucial differences which created the Industrial Revolution in Europe were sources of coal near manufacturing centers, and raw materials such as food and wood from the New World, which allowed Europe to expand economically in a way that China could not.[14] However, most historians contest the assertion that Europe and China were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on Western Europe in the late eighteenth century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in purchasing power parity (and Britain had a per capita income of nearly 2,000 dollars[15] whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars. Also, the average interest rate was about 5 percent in Britain and over 30 percent in China, which illustrates how capital was much more abundant in Britain; capital that was available for investment. Some historians such as David Landes[16] and Max Weber credit the different belief systems in China and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred. The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of Judaeo-Christianity, and Greek thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like Confucius, Mencius, Han Feizi (Legalism), Lao Tzu (Taoism), and Buddha (Buddhism). The key difference between these belief systems was that those from Europe focused on the individual, while Chinese beliefs centered around relationships between people. The family unit was more important than the individual for the large majority of Chinese history, and this may have played a role in why the Industrial Revolution took much longer to occur in China. There was the additional difference of outlook. In traditional societies, people tend to look backwards to tradition for answers to their questions. One of the inventions of the modern age was the invention of progress, where people look hopefully to the future. Furthermore, Western European peoples had experienced the Renaissance and Reformation; other parts of the world had not had a similar intellectual breakout, a condition that holds true even into the twenty-first century. Regarding India, the Marxist historian Rajani Palme Dutt has been quoted as saying, ""The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in England.""[17] In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms, with the three major ones being the Marathas, Sikhs and the Mughals. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors—agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and technical innovation was non-existent. The vast amounts of wealth were stored away in palace treasuries, and as such, were easily moved to Britain. The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slavery provided only 5 percent of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.[18] Alternatively, the greater liberalization of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and utilize emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and possessing the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets having been destroyed during the war by the Royal Navy[19]). Britain\'s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain\'s geographical position—an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe. Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. Enclosure of common land and the related Agricultural Revolution made a supply of this labor readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the North of England, the English Midlands, South Wales and the Scottish Lowlands. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry. The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688, and British society\'s greater receptiveness to change (when compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favoring the Industrial Revolution. In large part due to the Enclosure movement, the peasantry was destroyed as significant source of resistance to industrialization, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.[20] Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.1 The existence of this class is often linked to the Protestant work ethic (see Max Weber) and the particular status of dissenting Protestant sects, such as the Quakers, Baptists and Presbyterians that had flourished with the English Civil War. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the Bank of England, contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures. Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England\'s only two Universities at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland\'s four universities). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official Anglican church became mandatory due to the Test Act, they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The Unitarians, in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences—areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies. Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the middle class, such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the Scientific revolution of the 17th century. In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labor dominated by a pace set by machines. However, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place as well. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel—child labor, dirty living conditions and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.[21] Industrialization led to the creation of the factory. Arguably the first was John Lombe\'s water-powered silk mill at Derby was operational by 1721. However, the rise of the factory came somewhat later when cotton- spinning was mechanized. The factory system was largely responsible for the rise of the modern city, as workers migrated into the cities in search of employment in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed Cottonopolis, and arguably the world\'s first industrial city. For much of the nineteenth century, production was done in small mills, which were typically powered by water and built to serve local needs. Later each mill would have its own steam engine and a tall chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler. The transition to industrialization was not wholly smooth. For example, a group of English workers known as Luddites formed to protest against industrialization and sometimes sabotaged factories, by throwing a wooden shoe (sabot) into the mechanical works. One of the earliest reformers of factory conditions was Robert Owen. In other industries the transition to factory production followed a slightly different course. In 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system. The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase. Industrial workers were better paid than those in agriculture. With more money, women ate better and had healthier babies, who were themselves better fed. Child mortality rates declined, and the distribution of age in the population became more youthful. There was limited opportunity for formal education, and children were expected to work in order to bring home wages. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new there were no experienced adult laborers. This made child labor the labor of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution. Child labor had existed before the Industrial Revolution, but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Before the passing of laws protecting children, many were forced to work in terrible conditions for much lower pay than their elders. Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines[22] and textile factories[23] and these helped to spread knowledge the children\'s plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers\' welfare. Politicians and the government tried to limit child labor by law, but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation, and others simply welcomed the cheap labor. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labor, the Factory Acts, were passed in England: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law. About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. These laws decreased the number of child laborers; however, child labor remained in Europe up to the twentieth century. Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the splendor of the homes of the owners to the squalor of the lives of the workers. Cliffe Castle, Keighley, is a good example of how the newly rich chose to live. This is a large home modeled loosely on a castle with towers and garden walls. The home is very large and was surrounded by a massive garden, the Cliffe Castle is now open to the public as a museum. Poor people lived in very small houses in cramped streets. These homes would share toilet facilities, have open sewers and would be at risk of damp. Disease was spread through a contaminated water supply. Conditions did improve during the nineteenth century as public health acts were introduced covering things such as sewage, hygiene and making some boundaries upon the construction of homes. Not everybody lived in homes like these. The Industrial Revolution created a larger middle class of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. The conditions for the poor improved over the course of the 19th century because of government and local plans which led to cities becoming cleaner places, but life had not been easy for the poor before industrialization. However, as a result of the Revolution, huge numbers of the working class died due to disease spreading through the cramped living conditions. Chest diseases from the mines, cholera from polluted water and typhoid were also extremely common, as was smallpox. Accidents in factories with child and female workers were regular. Dickens\' novels perhaps best illustrate this; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw. Strikes and riots by workers were also relatively common. The rapid industrialization of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The textile industry in particular industrialized early, and many weavers found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labor to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of Ned Ludd, a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811.[24] The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government had to take drastic measures to protect industry. The Industrial Revolution concentrated labor into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organization of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labor and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffer the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining. The main method the unions used to effect change was strike action. Strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In England, the Combination Act forbade workers to form any kind of trade union from 1799 until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. In the 1830s and 1840s the Chartist movement was the first large scale organized working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration. Working people also formed friendly societies and co-operative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as Robert Owen also supported these organizations to improve the conditions of the working class. Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a General Strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organized through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.[25] Eventually effective political organization for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to became the British Labour Party. The application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5 percent in 1730 - 1749 to 31.8 percent in 1810 - 1829.[26] Besides, there was a significant increase in worker wages during the period 1813-1913.[27][28][29] The advent of The Enlightenment provided an intellectual framework which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of scientific knowledge—a factor evidenced in the systematic development of the steam engine, guided by scientific analysis, and the development of the political and sociological analyzes, culminating in Adam Smith\'s The Wealth of Nations. One of the main arguments for capitalism is that industrialization increases wealth for all, as evidenced by rising life expectancy, reduced working hours, and no work for children and the elderly. Marxism is essentially a reaction to the Industrial Revolution.[30] According to Karl Marx, industrialization polarized society into the bourgeoisie (those who own the means of production, the factories and the land) and the much larger proletariat (the working class who actually perform the labor necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production). He saw the industrialization process as the logical dialectical progression of feudal economic modes, necessary for the full development of capitalism, which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of socialism and eventually communism. During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards (or an emotional retreat from) the new industrialization developed. This was known as the Romantic movement. Its major exponents in English literature included the artist and poet William Blake and poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The movement stressed the importance of ""nature"" in art and language, in contrast to \'monstrous\' machines and factories; the ""Dark satanic mills"" of Blake\'s poem And did those feet in ancient time. Mary Shelley\'s short story Frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN 052143744X All links retrieved January 11, 2018.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.[1]  The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured  property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.[2] The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth.  Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[3][4][5]  At approximately the same time the Industrial Revolution was occurring, Britain was undergoing an agricultural revolution, which also helped to improve living standards and provided surplus labour available for industry. Mechanised textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in  Belgium, and later in France.  Since then industrialisation has spread throughout much of the world.[1] The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[6][7][8][9] GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,[10] while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.[11] Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants.[12] The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories.[13][14][15] The earliest recorded use of the term ""Industrial Revolution"" seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto, announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise.[16] In his 1976 book Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, Raymond Williams states in the entry for ""Industry"": ""The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen, between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [19th] century."" The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui\'s description in 1837 of la révolution industrielle.[17] Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of ""an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society"".  However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee, whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.[18] Some historians, such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians. The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,[19] beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies: In the late 17th and early 18th centuries the British government passed a series of Calico Acts in order to protect the domestic woollen industry from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from its competitors in India.[22][28] The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around Lancashire that produced fustian, a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft.  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.[28] On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the putting-out system.  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  In the off season the women, typically farmers\' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the spinning wheel, it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.[21][28][29]:823  The flying shuttle patented in 1733 by John Kay, with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John\'s son, Robert, invented the drop box.[29]:821–22 Lewis Paul patented the roller spinning frame and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of Birmingham.  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt\'s machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Lewis\'s invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule. In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.[30]  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.[31] It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,[32] and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft, not warp.[29]:825–27 The spinning frame or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.[29]:827–30  For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name. Samuel Crompton\'s Spinning Mule, introduced in 1779, was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.[29]:832  Crompton\'s mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce good quality calico cloth.[29]:832 Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical power loom which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.[29]:834  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright\'s loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock\'s loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill & Co.[33] The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. Eli Whitney responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive cotton gin.  With a cotton gin a man could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would have previously taken a woman working two months to process at one pound per day.[14] Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of yarn increased greatly. This in turn fed a weaving industry that advanced with improvements to shuttles and the loom or \'frame\'. The output of an individual labourer increased dramatically, with the effect that the new machines threatened the bargaining power of the labourers, and early innovators were attacked and their inventions destroyed.[34] These advances were capitalised on by entrepreneurs, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as Thomas Highs and John Kay; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power—first horse power and then water power—which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Before long steam power was applied to drive textile machinery. Manchester acquired the nickname Cottonopolis during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.[35] A major change in the metal industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of wood and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,[36] and coal was more abundant than wood.[21] Use of coal in smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir Clement Clerke and others from 1678, using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture, reducing the oxide to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The foundry cupola is a different (and later) innovation.) This was followed by Abraham Darby, who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709. However, the coke pig iron he made was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron in forges until the mid-1750s, when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron. Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III. Wrought iron for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in finery forges, as it long had been. However, new processes were adopted in the ensuing years. The first is referred to today as potting and stamping, but this was superseded by Henry Cort\'s puddling process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: rolling in 1783 and puddling in 1784.[27]  Rolling replaced hammering for consolidating wrought iron and expelling some of the dross.  Rolling was 15 times faster than hammering with a trip hammer. Roller mills were first used for making sheets, but also were developed for rolling structural shapes such as angles and rails. Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost. Puddling was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation, with iron ore as the oxygen source, as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.[37]  Puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, allowing coal or coke to be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Up to that time, British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies. This came principally from Sweden from the mid-17th century and later also from Russia from the end of the 1720s. However, from 1785, imports decreased because of the new iron making technology, and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron consumer goods. Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using waste exhaust heat to preheat combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coal or two-thirds using coke;[38] however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.[39]  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or anthracite could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;[40] however, by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably. Two decades before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the cementation process. The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of machine tools allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries. The development of the stationary steam engine was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000\xa0hp.[41]  Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread electrification in the early 20th century. These included crank, treadle powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.[42] The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to Thomas Savery in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one horsepower (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its ""brand name"", The Miner\'s Friend). Savery\'s pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century. The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by Thomas Newcomen before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a lot of capital to build, and produced about 5\xa0hp (3.7\xa0kW). They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.[43] A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt. In close collaboration with Englishman Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the low pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen\'s. Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry, for the manufacture of such engines, in 1795. By 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double-acting rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt\'s basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm Boulton & Watt had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving blast furnaces, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10\xa0hp (7.5\xa0kW). The development of machine tools, such as the engine lathe, planing, milling  and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines. Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine, built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the table engine. Around the start of the 19th century, the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick, and the American, Oliver Evans began to construct higher pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats. The Industrial Revolution created a demand for metal parts used in machinery.  This led to the development of several machine tools for cutting metal parts.  They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms. Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal was kept to a minimum. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.  Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen—millwrights built water and wind mills, carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. The first large machine tool was the cylinder boring machine used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The planing machine, the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century. Henry Maudslay, who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.[14][29]:392–95  The slide rest lathe was called one of history\'s most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay\'s idea.[14]:31, 36 Maudslay left Bramah\'s employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships\' pulley blocks for the Royal Navy in the Portsmouth Block Mills. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for mass production and making components with a degree of interchangeability. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as Richard Roberts, Joseph Clement and Joseph Whitworth. James Fox of Derby had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did Matthew Murray of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement. The impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts.[44] In the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the machine industry became the largest industrial sector of the economy, by value added, in the U.S.[45] The large scale production of chemicals was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of sulphuric acid by the lead chamber process invented by the Englishman John Roebuck (James Watt\'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of lead. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around 100 pounds (50\xa0kg) in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase. The production of an alkali on a large scale became an important goal as well, and Nicolas Leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of sodium carbonate. The Leblanc process was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid. The sodium sulphate was heated with limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants (barilla) or from kelp, which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,[46] and also to potash (potassium carbonate) derived from hardwood ashes. These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for bleaching cloth. The development of bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) by Scottish chemist Charles Tennant in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet, revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant\'s factory at St Rollox, North Glasgow, became the largest chemical plant in the world. After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in dyestuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.[47] Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.[48] In 1824 Joseph Aspdin, a British bricklayer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1,400\xa0°C (2,552\xa0°F), then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and gravel to produce concrete. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer Marc Isambard Brunel several years later when constructing the Thames Tunnel.[49] Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the London sewerage system a generation later. Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was gas lighting. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton & Watt, the Birmingham steam engine pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before. A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure. A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for Saint-Léger Didot family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, who were stationers in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today. The method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other continuous production processes.[50] The British Agricultural Revolution is considered one of the causes of the Industrial Revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy.[51] Industrial technologies that affected farming included the seed drill, the Dutch plough, which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine. Jethro Tull invented an improved seed drill in 1701.  It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull\'s seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.[52] Joseph Foljambe\'s Rotherham plough of 1730, was the first commercially successful iron plough.[53][54][55][56]  The threshing machine,  invented by Andrew Meikle in 1784, displaced hand threshing with a flail, a laborious job that took about one-quarter of agricultural labour.[57]:286  It took several decades to diffuse[58] and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the Swing Riots. Machine tools and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.[44] Coal mining in Britain, particularly in South Wales started early. Before the steam engine, pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill. Shaft mining was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by Savery in 1698 and the Newcomen steam engine in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of John Smeaton\'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt\'s more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable. Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of firedamp in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in 1816 by Sir Humphry Davy and independently by George Stephenson. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off coal dust explosions, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls. Other developments included more efficient water wheels, based on experiments conducted by the British engineer John Smeaton[59] the beginnings of a machine industry[14][60] and the rediscovery of concrete (based on hydraulic lime mortar) by John Smeaton, which had been lost for 1300 years.[61] At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. Wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution improved Britain\'s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly. Canals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.[29][62] Building of canals dates to ancient times.  The Grand Canal in China, ""the world\'s largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence,"" parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is 1,121 miles (1,804\xa0km) long and links Hangzhou with Beijing.[63] In the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  Known for its huge commercial success, the Bridgewater Canal in North West England, which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater.  From Worsley to the rapidly growing town of Manchester its construction cost £168,000 (£22,589,130 as of  2013),[64][65] but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.[66] This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as Canal Mania.[67] New canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal, the most notable being the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Thames and Severn Canal which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively. By the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the Manchester Ship Canal, which upon opening in 1894 was the largest ship canal in the world,[68] and opened Manchester as a port. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper. Britain\'s canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain. Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust. New engineered roads were built by John Metcalf, Thomas Telford and most notably John McAdam, with the first \'macadamised\' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.[70] The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of pack horse. Stage coaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts. Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England. Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive puddled iron after 1800, the rolling mill for making rails, and the development of the high pressure steam engine also around 1800. Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam locomotive were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: Metallurgy Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high pressure steam engines after the expiration of the Boulton and Watt patent in 1800. High pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 Rainhill Trials, which demonstrated Robert Stephenson\'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of Hot blast, which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the blast furnace. On 15 September 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington.[72] The railway was engineered by Joseph Locke and George Stephenson, linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of Manchester with the port town of Liverpool. The opening was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to Railway Mania. Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories. Prior to the Industrial Revolution most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as land owners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers.  By the time of the Industrial Revolution the putting-out system whereby farmers and townspeople produced goods in their homes, often described as cottage industry, was the standard.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist provided the raw materials, typically paid workers by the piece, and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.[73] Some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a 40 spindle jenny for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.[74]  Later machinery such as spinning frames, spinning mules and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.  Many workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity. The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by Karl Marx, however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.[75] Women\'s historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.[76][77] Taking a pessimistic side, Alice Clark argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class and women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.[78] In a more positive interpretation, Ivy Pinchbeck argues that capitalism created the conditions for women\'s emancipation.[79]  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the ""family wage economy"" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the ""family consumer economy,"" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.[80] The effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.[81] A series of 1950s essays by Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.[81] During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.[82][83][84] Some economists, such as Robert E. Lucas, Jr., say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that ""for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth\xa0... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility.""[3] Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy\'s overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers\' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.[4][5] Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years, and only slightly higher in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years.[85] In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply had been increasing and prices falling before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by Thomas Malthus.[21]>[57][86][87]  Before the Industrial Revolution, advances in agriculture or technology soon led to an increase in population, which again strained food and other resources, limiting increases in per capita income.  This condition is called the Malthusian trap, and it was finally overcome by industrialisation.[57] Transportation improvements, such as canals and improved roads, also lowered food costs.  Railroads were introduced near the end of the Industrial Revolution. Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from splendour for factory owners to squalor for workers. In The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 Friedrich Engels described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high. Eight to ten unrelated mill workers often shared a room, often with no furniture, and slept on a pile of straw or sawdust.[88] Toilet facilities were shared if they existed.  Disease spread through a contaminated water supply.  Also, people were at risk of developing pathologies due to persistent dampness. The famines that troubled rural areas did not happen in industrial areas. But urban people—especially small children—died due to diseases spreading through the cramped living conditions. Tuberculosis (spread in congested dwellings), lung diseases from the mines, cholera from polluted water and typhoid were also common. Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of professionals, such as lawyers and doctors, who lived in much better conditions. Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating. According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore, the population of England and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.[89]  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.[90][91] Europe\'s population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[92] The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.[93] In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life.[94] However, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel—child labour, dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.[95] Industrialisation led to the creation of the factory. Arguably the first highly mechanised was John Lombe\'s water-powered silk mill at Derby, operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, since the silk industry there was a closely guarded secret, the state of the industry there is unknown.  Because Lombe\'s factory was not successful and there was no follow through, the rise of the modern factory dates to somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanised. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed ""Cottonopolis"", and the world\'s first industrial city.[96] Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. Bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.[97] For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically water-powered and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler. The transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty. For example, a group of English workers known as Luddites formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes sabotaged factories. In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was Robert Owen, known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the New Lanark mills, and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the early socialist movement. By 1746 an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton (whose Soho Manufactory was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system. The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly.[99][100] There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children.[101] Child labour existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,[102] 10–20% of an adult male\'s wage.[103] Children as young as four were employed.[103] Beatings and long hours were common, with some child coal miners and hurriers working from 4 am until 5 pm.[103] Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.[103] Many children developed lung cancer and other diseases and died before the age of 25.[103] Workhouses would sell orphans and abandoned children as ""pauper apprentices"", working without wages for board and lodging.[103] Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters shackling them to prevent escape.[103] Children employed as mule scavengers by cotton mills would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.[103] Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop phossy jaw.[103] Children employed at glassworks were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at potteries were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.[103] Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines[104] and textile factories,[105] and these helped to popularise the children\'s plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers\' welfare. Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation, and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the Factory Acts, were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.[103] About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. These laws decreased the number of child labourers, however child labour remained in Europe and the United States up to the 20th century.[106] The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near Nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of Ned Ludd, a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the militia or army to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or transported for life. Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the Captain Swing disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and hayrick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of trade unions, and further pressure for reform. The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining. The main method the unions used to effect change was strike action. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the Combination Act 1799 forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. In 1832, the Reform Act extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from Tolpuddle in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George\'s brother James Loveless, George\'s brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas\'s son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Chartist movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration. Working people also formed friendly societies and co-operative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as Robert Owen also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class. Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a general strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.[107] Eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British Labour Party. The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.[108] The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain\'s Alkali Acts, passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution (gaseous hydrochloric acid) given off by the Leblanc process, used to produce soda ash. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted smoke, grit, dust and fumes under supervision. The manufactured gas industry began in British cities  in 1812–1820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost  and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.[109]  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.[110] In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.[111] Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The Coal Smoke Abatement Society was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.[112] The application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.[99] The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive urbanisation and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world\'s population lived in cities,[113] compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).[114] Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.[115] Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,[6] while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.[7] The Industrial Revolution on Continental Europe came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called \'Miniature England\' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as iron), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted. Belgium was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: Wallonia (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Liège and Charleroi. The leader was a transplanted Englishman John Cockerill. His factories at Seraing integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.[116] Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word ""houille"" was coined in Wallonia),[117] the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its Sillon industriel, \'Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, (...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...\'.[118] Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: ""It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain.""[119] ""The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of Ghent.""[120] Michel De Coster, Professor at the Université de Liège wrote also: ""The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated."" [121] Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the Sillon industriel, which runs from Mons in the west, to Verviers in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In \'Breaking stereotypes\', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say: The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear take-off.[123] Instead, France\'s economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice Lévy-Leboyer: Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world\'s chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on aniline was critical.[124] Germany\'s political disunity—with three dozen states—and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain\'s. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France[125] During the period 1790–1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a protoindustrialisation, with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s. During 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in Bergslagen, textile mills in Sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in Norrland. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848. During 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873. During 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, papermaking and textile. During the late 18th an early 19th centuries when the UK and parts of Western Europe began to industrialise, the US was primarily an agricultural and natural resource producing and processing economy.[126]  The building of roads and canals, the introduction of steamboats and the building of railroads were important for handling agricultural and natural resource products in the large and sparsely populated country of the period.[127][128] Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the cotton gin and the development of a system for making interchangeable parts, the latter aided by the development of the milling machine in the US.  The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world\'s leading industrial nation in the late 19th century. Oliver Evans invented an automated flour mill in the mid 1780s that used control mechanisms and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern materials handling system an important advance in the progress toward mass production.[44] The United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated  in  New England and the  Northeastern United States, which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest. Thomas Somers and the Cabot Brothers founded the Beverly Cotton Manufactory in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,[129] and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater\'s Mill.[130] In 1793, Samuel Slater (1768–1835) founded the Slater Mill at Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in Derbyshire, England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater\'s Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.[131] Daniel Day established a wool carding mill in the Blackstone Valley at Uxbridge, Massachusetts in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in Hartford, Connecticut, and the second at Watertown, Massachusetts.) The John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor retraces the history of ""America\'s Hardest-Working River\', the Blackstone. The Blackstone River and its tributaries, which cover more than 45 miles (72\xa0km) from Worcester, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island, was the birthplace of America\'s Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater\'s mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America\'s Industrial and Technological Development. Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell from Newburyport, Massachusetts memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the War of 1812 had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the Boston Manufacturing Company. Lowell and his partners built America\'s second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at Waltham, Massachusetts, second to the Beverly Cotton Manufactory. After his death in 1817, his associates built America\'s first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering, one of the first uses of it in the United States. Lowell, Massachusetts, using 5.6 miles (9.0\xa0km) of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the Merrimack River, is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like Waltham-Lowell system was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the Irish Potato Famine, the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour. The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the Waltham Watch Company, with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches. The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin). In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The Bank of Japan, founded in 1882,[132] used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west. Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.[133] Steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a ""Second Industrial Revolution"", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s, when Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.[29][134]  Bessemer steel was being displaced by the open hearth furnace near the end of the 19th century. This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the chemical industries, petroleum (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the automotive industry, and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany. The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation. A new revolution began with electricity and electrification in the electrical industries. The introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the Alps enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s. By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like U.S. Steel, General Electric, Standard Oil and Bayer AG joined the railroad and ship companies on the world\'s stock markets. During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.[135]  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet William Blake and poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The movement stressed the importance of ""nature"" in art and language, in contrast to ""monstrous"" machines and factories; the ""Dark satanic mills"" of Blake\'s poem ""And did those feet in ancient time"". Mary Shelley\'s novel Frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticisim likewise was highly critical of industry.[136] The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century.  The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into cottage industry, for example weaving, and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories.[137] The colonial expansion of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors, as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century.[138] Until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.[139] However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.[140] Lewis Mumford has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the Early Middle Ages, much earlier than most estimates.[141] He explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that ""the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock"". He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine. The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them.[142] Internal tariffs were abolished by Henry VIII of England, they survived in Russia till 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain. Governments\' grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system (the Statute of Monopolies in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.[143] Watt\'s monopoly may have prevented other inventors, such as Richard Trevithick, William Murdoch or Jonathan Hornblower, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the industrial revolution by about 16 years.[144][145] One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, India, and the Middle East, or at other times like in Classical Antiquity[146] or the Middle Ages.[147] Numerous factors have been suggested, including education, technological changes[148] (see Scientific Revolution in Europe), ""modern"" government, ""modern"" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.[149] However, most historians contest the assertion that Europe and China were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in purchasing power parity (and Britain had a per capita income of nearly 2,000 dollars[150]) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars. Some historians such as David Landes and Max Weber credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.[151]  The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of Judaeo-Christianity and Greek thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like Confucius, Mencius, Han Feizi (Legalism), Lao Tzu (Taoism), and Buddha (Buddhism), resulting in very different worldviews.[152] Other factors include the considerable distance of China\'s coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable Yellow River that connects these deposits to the sea.[153] Regarding India, the Marxist historian Rajani Palme Dutt said: ""The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in Britain.""[154] In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms, with the three major ones being the Marathas, Sikhs and the Mughals. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors—agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over. Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution.[155]  Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland; (2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law (respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a straightforward legal system which allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations); and (5) a free market (capitalism).[21] Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coast lines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in Europe.[21] There were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain. These values were self-interest and an entrepreneurial spirit. Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth. These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.[156] The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.[157] Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain\'s industrial output.[158] Instead, the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the Royal Navy[159]). Britain\'s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain\'s geographical position—an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe. Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. Enclosure of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the North of England, the English Midlands, South Wales and the Scottish Lowlands. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry. The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688, and British society\'s greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.[160] (This point is also made in Hilaire Belloc\'s The Servile State.) Britain\'s population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe grew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse\'s work was mechanised. A workhorse needs 3 to 5 acres (1.21 to 2.02\xa0ha) for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy. In 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe\'s best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank. Without coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.[161] Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods. Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the Lunar Society of Birmingham, in which members met to discuss \'natural philosophy\' (i.e. science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, ""They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution"".[162] Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based Royal Society of Arts published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual Transactions. There were publications describing technology. Encyclopaedias such as Harris\'s Lexicon Technicum (1704) and Abraham Rees\'s Cyclopaedia (1802–1819) contain much of value. Cyclopaedia contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the Descriptions des Arts et Métiers and Diderot\'s Encyclopédie explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates. Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the Annales des Mines, published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours. Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.[163] The existence of this class is often linked to the Protestant work ethic (see Max Weber) and the particular status of the Baptists and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the Quakers and Presbyterians that had flourished with the English Civil War. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the Bank of England, contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures. Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England\'s only two universities at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland\'s four universities). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official Anglican Church became mandatory due to the Test Act, they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The Unitarians, in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences—areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies. Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the middle class, such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.', 'This website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks.

The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human social history, comparable to the invention of farming or the rise of the first city-states; almost every aspect of daily life and human society was eventually influenced in some way. The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and remain a topic for debate, with some historians seeing the Revolution as an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century. As national border controls became more effective, the spread of disease was lessened, therefore preventing the epidemics common in previous times. The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly, leading to a larger workforce.

where is the democratic republic of congo on the world map,"[""The Democratic Republic of the Congo (French: République démocratique du Congo), commonly referred to as DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa or the DRC, is a country in central Africa. It was known as Zaïre from 1971 to 1997. It is the second largest country in Africa by area and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 71 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous Francophone (French-speaking) country. DRC borders the Central African Republic and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo, the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a 40-kilometre (25\xa0mi) stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9\xa0km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa. When the Belgian Congo became independent, its leaders fought each other. The Soviet Union and later the United Nations helped destroy the groups who wanted independence from the new country. The Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated the country. It involved nine African nations and some twenty armed groups. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues in the east of the country. The war is the world's deadliest conflict since World War II, killing 5.4 million people since 1998. The vast majority died from conditions of malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly, in chronological order, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-Léopoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire (Zaïre in French). Though it is in the Central African United Nations subregion, the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The country is bordered by Angola, the South Atlantic Ocean, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika, and Zambia. The capital of the CAR is Kinshasa. World Heritage Sites in the Democratic Republic of Congo include Virunga National Park (1979), Garamba National Park (1980), Kahuzi-Biega National Park (1980), Salonga National Park (1984) and Okapi Wildlife Reserve (1996).

The Lowland Gorilla lives further south near Bukavu in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park. The park which is in a mountainous jungle area was the first in Africa to allow viewing of gorilla families. The live volcanoes of Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo are near the town of Goma and erupt periodically. Nyiragongo erupted violently in 2002, partially destroying the town of Goma and minor fissures continue to appear. Both volcanoes have craters bubbling with live magma and are a spectacular sight. The wildlife in Virunga National Park is one of the most varied in the region. It is not clear how badly poaching has affected animal populations in recent years, but the Rwindi plains had extensive savannah game and the highest hippo population in Africa. Chimpanzees can be seen in the Tongo sanctuary just north of Nyamulagira volcano. Garamba in the far north eastern corner is a forgotten but spectacular park. It is the last refuge of the northern white rhino in Africa. Although poaching has reduced the numbers it is thought that the rhino still survives. Garamba is also the home of the first African elephants that were domesticated in the early 1900’s and riding elephants on safari used to be one of the main attractions. The Okapi is a doe-eyed creature resembling a cross between a zebra and a giraffe lives around Epulu and is a very unusual animal. This area is also the home of the Efe pygmies who continue to hunt in their traditional way. Pygmy communities can also be seen around Mt Hoyo.

what is a central belief of the new age movement,"['', '', '""The general consensus is that Hubczejak’s real genius lay in his precisely calculated ability to marshal the confused, bastardized, late-twentieth-century ideology known as “New Age thinking” to his advantage. He was the first of his generation to see beyond the ridiculous, contradictory and outmoded superstitions it adopted to the fact that New Age thought appealed to a very real suffering symptomatic of psychological, ontological and social breakdown. Beyond the repellent mix of fundamentalist eco-babble, attraction to tradition and the “sacred” which they inherited from their spiritual forebears, the Esalen commune and the hippie movement, New Agers had a genuine desire to break with the twentieth century, its immorality, its individualism and its libertarian and antisocial aspects. It testified to the anguished awareness that a society cannot function without the unifying axis of some kind of religion; it was, in effect, a call for a new paradigm."" --Atomised (1998) by Michel Houellebecq New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of spiritual or Mind, Body, Spirit and rarely use the term ""New Age"" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a milieu or zeitgeist. As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought and Theosophy. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term ""New Age"" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. Theologically, the New Age typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming Age of Aquarius, from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on a New Age approach to science that seeks to unite science and spirituality. Centred primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.', 'Passionate about helping others heal naturally, safely and effectively.

Missouri’s Wildlife Code Protects Snakes Few Missourians realize that all snakes native to our state are protected. The Wildlife Code of Missouri treats snakes, lizards, and most turtles as nongame. This means that there is no open season on these animals, and it is technically unlawful to kill them. There is a realistic exception, however: when a venomous snake is in close association with people, which could result in someone being bitten. We hope that more people realize that snakes are interesting, valuable, and, for the most part, harmless. How to Tell Venomous from Nonvenomous Snakes Venomous snakes All venomous snakes native to Missouri are members of the pit viper family. Pit vipers have a characteristic pit located between the eye and nostril on each side of the head. They also have a pair of well-developed fangs. Note the shape of the pupil. The pupils of venomous snakes appear as vertical slits within the iris. Our venomous species all have a single row of scales along the underside of the tail. Missouri’s venomous snakes include the copperhead, cottonmouth, western pygmy rattlesnake, massasauga rattlesnake, and timber rattlesnake. The western diamond-backed rattlesnake and coral snake are not found in Missouri. The most common venomous snake in Missouri is the copperhead. To our knowledge, there have only been two human deaths attributed to venomous snakes in Missouri: a 1933 timber rattlesnake bite and a 1965 copperhead bite. Nonvenomous snakes Harmless snakes have round pupils and a double row of scales along the undersides of their tails. A triangle-shaped head doesn’t necessarily mean danger. Although the venomous snakes have a somewhat triangle-shaped head, several harmless species, such as water-snakes, gartersnakes, and hog-nosed snakes, can and do flatten their heads, which can cause them to appear triangular.

""Falconry based bird abatement"" is the use of trained falcons and hawks to intimidate and scare off nuisance birds which cause loss of revenue for crop growers, health hazards in landfills, and safety concerns in airfields.', 'The state of Texas is home to at least 15 dangerous snake species. Some of the most venomous are the cottonmouth, the copperhead, the Western rattlesnake, the timber rattlesnake, the blacktail rattlesnake, the Western diamondback rattlesnake, the Massagauga pygmy rattlesnake, and the harlequin coral snake. However, in Texas you can also come across some non-venomous snakes that look similar to their venomous relatives; some of them even emit a rattling sound. For example, the venomous coral snake and the milk snake look remarkably alike. Snakes have a critical role to play in the ecosystem, and not all snakes are harmful to humans. However, pit vipers, who get their name because they have a pit close to each nostril that allows them to sense the body heat of warm-blooded victims, are venomous. There are actually over 150 pit viper species around the world, with even more subspecies and varieties. Texas coral snakes, on the other hand, are not pit vipers but Elapids, like the cobra. The Western or Texas diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) is the largest pit viper with the capacity to grow to over eight feet in the right conditions. You’ll find this snake all over Texas except for the east and the northern panhandle, and especially in areas of thick brush or vegetation, usually opting for dry areas rather than wetlands. It is a very heavy snake, and it is the second cause of deaths due to snakebite in the country after its Eastern cousin. Its brownish “base” with cream outlines around the classic diamond shape and a quick to respond rattle announce its presence. The Western diamondback has a massive range, extending well into Mexico and stretching from the Southeast to California and approximately halfway to Canada. Although the venom is somewhat less toxic than some other rattlesnakes, it makes up for it by producing immense quantities, as much as 800 mg can be delivered in a full envenomation. The venom causes severe muscle deterioration as well as massive internal bleeding. As with the Eastern diamondback, fatality rates are estimated at 20%. The Western diamondback only trails its Eastern cousin (slightly) in U.S. annual fatalities and would certainly be the leading killer if its habitat were less sparsely settled by humans. The Western\xa0diamondback is easily the snake most responsible for venomous snakebite deaths in Mexico. Copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix) are brown, tan or rust-colored with lighter gray, brown or copper bands and patches. They are easily camouflaged by the leaf covered forest ground, and as a result they are dangerous to accidentally come across.\xa0 The copperhead is a member of the pit viper family, like most of the venomous snakes in North America. Its primary range is along the Eastern Seaboard as far north as New York and inland as far west as Nebraska. Just like the coral snake, the copperhead has been copied by other non-dangerous species of snake such as the northern water snake. A moderately-sized snake, most copperheads are less than 36\xa0inches with larger specimens reaching 48\xa0inches. The snake is fairly stout with weights from 1/2 to 3/4 of a pound. The venom of copperheads is weaker than that of other pit adders. It is considered to be non-aggressive, and when excited/threatened, the copperhead will often assume a “freeze” strategy and rely on its excellent camouflage (ironically, making it easier for unwary humans to step on it, provoking a bite). All pit vipers are capable of delivering a bite with little or no venom delivered, but the copperhead is unique in that most defensive first strikes include no venom. If the snake is still being threatened, a second strike almost always does include venom. The Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) has brightly colored markings that can easily be confused to that of non-venomous species, who have developed them to look more threatening to potential predators and ward them off. If the yellow and red bands touch - not red and black - you are facing a venomous coral snake. This rhyme might help you to remember: “Red and yellow, can kill a fellow; Red and black, a friend of Jack” This essentially means when red and yellow are together in the pattern, the snake is venomous. If the red is next to a black stripe, the snake is not venomous. Coral snakes tend to live in soil or within rock burrows, particularly in scrub-covered sand hills. They are shy, but their nocturnal habits can create problems for humans. In case a bite does occur, symptoms can develop as paralysis sets in, with slurring of speech, vision issues, and respiratory failure. Fatality rates are estimated to be as high as 20%, but there is some ""good"" news: coral snakes are unable to release their venom fully in a single strike and full evenomation requires a chewing-like process and a relatively long bite. It is estimated that 40% of the bites (about 100 per year in North America) to humans contain no, or very little venom. The Western (Micruroides euryxanthus) and Eastern (Micrurus fulvius) coral snakes are pretty similar in many ways. Both have some of the most potent neurotoxic venom in North America, both are brightly colored with primary black and red stripes with smaller yellow encircling stripes, and both species prefer the southern part of North America. The Western coral snake is approximately 24\xa0inches with larger examples exceeding 30\xa0inches. Although rarely seen in daylight, the Western coral snake prefers dry, rocky areas and desert. The Eastern coral snake typically burrows underground during the day and prefers leafy forest areas. The cottonmouth bite is much more dangerous and harmful to humans than the bite of the closely related copperhead. The cottonmouth is more aggressive, but as with the copperhead, biting isn’t common unless the snake is actually touched. Conversely, the cottonmouth/water moccasin has a more aggressive reputation, but when threatened, will occasionally hiss and almost always assume a strike-ready pose. The biggest difference between the cottonmouth and the copperhead is that cottonmouth snakes are semi-aquatic and are most commonly found in marsh, swamp, and warmer streams and lakes. The cottonmouth is the only semi-aquatic viper in the world. They have been seen in saltwater and have colonized some near offshore islands on the east coast. Actually the third most dangerous rattlesnake in North America, the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) graces the famous Gadsden flag (don’t tread on me), and certainly has spawned more fear and respect from settlers than any other through the history of the United States! More of a medium-sized snake, the timber rattler is often found in rugged terrain and forests, although during the summer it is not unknown for pregnant females to head to warmer and more open spaces such as rocky ledges. Females tend to seek sunny open areas when preparing to give birth to 10-20 young. They are well known for their love of garter snakes, a common species of non-venomous snake found in Texas. The timber rattler can grow to more than five feet with the largest recorded at a few inches beyond 6 feet. Large specimens can weigh nearly 10 lbs. Typical adults will be near 40 inches. As with all rattlesnakes, the timber rattler can deliver considerable venom in a single, quick bite. Also typical of the entire genus, toxicity can vary among specimens, for the timber rattlesnake, this is especially pronounced and varies by region. With their large size, extremely long fangs, and the ability to deliver massive doses, a\xa0timber rattlesnake bite should be considered life-threatening. Fortunately, the timber rattlesnake is generally hesitant to strike defensively, displaying a long and vigorous posture\xa0with a loud rattle. It is mostly an ambush hunter that preys primarily on rabbit, birds, and small rodents, This mottled brown (often nearly black) can be extremely difficult to see.', ""The page you are looking for has left the site to go fly fishing\xa0on one of Missouri's many Ozark streams.

However, in Texas you can also come across some non-venomous snakes that look similar to their venomous relatives; some of them even emit a rattling sound. Consider the venomous coral snake and the milk snake, which look remarkably alike. There are at least 15 potentially dangerous snake species in Texas: however, estimates show that more deaths are attributed to lightning strikes than to snakebites. Outreach by snake experts has ensured that people are aware of how dangerous these snakes can be, and modern first aid and medical practices mean that people are usually treated properly and in time. Snakes have a critical role to play in the ecosystem, and not all snakes are harmful to humans. However, there are also dangerous types such as the pit vipers or adders, who get their name because they have a pit close to each nostril that allows them to sense the body heat of warm-blooded victims. There are over 150 pit viper species around the world, with even more subspecies and varieties. The most lethal venomous snakes in Texas are pit vipers, and they include rattlesnakes and moccasin snakes such as the cottonmouth and the copperhead. Coral snakes, on the other hand, are not pit vipers but Elapids, like the cobra. Let's get to know them. The Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) has brightly colored markings that can easily be confused to that of non-venomous species, who have developed them to look more threatening to potential predators and ward them off.

They are easily camouflaged by the leaf covered forest ground, and as a result they are dangerous to accidentally come across. The venom of copperheads is weaker than that of other pit adders, but it can cause secondary infections besides pain and nausea. Copperheads are one of the venomous snakes in Florida as well. Another of the venomous snakes in Texas is the Western cottonmouth or water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma), which can be found near water, in the ditches, canals, swamps, marshes, ponds and lakes of the eastern and central parts of Texas as well as the Gulf coast. The Western cottonmouth is a stubby, muscular snake which can grow up to 157 cm (62 in). The inside of its mouth has white shading, hence why it is called a cottonmouth. The older the snake becomes, the darker its coloration is from lighter browns to darker shades as time advances. When it is attacked, this snake can defend itself using venom. Although it only attacks when threatened, the toxic venom requires medical intervention. These snakes can even bite under water: from swimmers to travelers, everyone in Texas needs to keep an eye out for them. Rattlesnakes get their name from the rattle sound they make before striking. They hunt for small prey such as rabbits, rats, and mice.

I also didn\'t see the semi-aquatic Western Mud Snake on your list. I encountered one last week, but I didn\'t know that it was a water snake.

This is the first site I came across: http://www.watersnake.net/Good thing they\'re not really that dangerous. Or else.. :( Saw one of these at Indian Camp Creek park in Wentzville/ Moscow Mills area today. Had i not had my 3 kids at a snake and lizard seminar at Busch Wildlife this morning i would have definitely thought this was a venomous snake. However what we learned today the easiest way to identify a venomous snake is not by its head but by diamond shaped eyes, single row of scales on the underside of their tail and if it has fangs or not. There are only 5 venomous snakes found in Missouri. Copperheads, Western Cottonmouth, Western Pygmy Rattlesnake, Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the Timber Rattlesnake. I encountered one of the creamy yellow diamondback water snakes while doing landscaping for an apartment complex in Columbia, MO on 8/7/2013. It was lying on tan mulch wrapped around a small bush near very large rocks overlooking a steep bank that drops down to an old creek bed.  The creek winds through town near walking/biking trails, businesses, homes and the MO University campus.  The snake was sunning at the southern-most bush on a 80 degree day (much cooler than our normal August temp) at 2pm.  I had grabbed the bush to remove weeds from the mulch and was surprised as I had not seen snakes on the upper grounds before.  I knew there were copperheads in the creek bed below.  Had I not seen the diamonds I would have kept working as the snake\'s color was the same as the mulch.  I backed away and the snake eventually disappeared down into the mulch, was seen going down through the rocks toward the creek bed.  I am a 60 year old retired RN who likes working outdoors, have lived in the country most of my life, have seen many snakes but the first diamondback water snake!  I am amazed and thankful it did not strike at my hands or legs/feet.  I will be more cautious and get snake boots. These are beautiful snakes, sadly many are killed out of fear and ignorance due to their resemblance to other venomous snakes like the cottonmouth.', ""Indiana's vast variety of habitats lends itself to a wide collection of snakes.

Indiana's vast variety of habitats lends itself to a wide collection of snakes. Some prefer wooded habitats while others prefer open meadows. Water snakes and those that prefer marshes or other wetlands are also present. Encountering a venomous snake is rare in Indiana, but all four venomous species are pit vipers that can be identified by their elliptical pupils, their triangular heads and the heat-sensing pits behind their nostrils. Of the over 30 species of snake found in Indiana, only four are venomous, and all four are pit vipers. The four species of venomous snake found in Indiana are the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus), northern copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen) and western cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus). Timber rattlesnakes inhabit a small area in south-central Indiana; the eastern massasauga is an endangered species that inhabits northern Indiana. Only a small, isolated population of cottonmouths exists in south-central Indiana. Copperheads have the largest range of any venomous snake in the state: it spreads across southern Indiana into areas of central Indiana. The black racer (Coluber constrictor) varies in color from black in the southern part of the state to blue in its northern range. Both color varieties exist in Indiana. These snakes are quite large, reaching lengths of 5 feet. The black rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta) is particularly large, growing up to 8 feet long. These snakes are particularly good climbers and are often encountered in the rafters of barns and other structures. Both racers and rat snakes are constrictors. Many of Indiana's snakes are patterned with colorful stripes, bands or blotches. Milk snakes (Lampropeltis triangulatum) have rust-colored blotches with thick, black outlines on a whitish-gray background. Brown snakes (Storeria dekayi) are light brown with a row of diamond-shaped spots along each side of their backs. The garter snakes (Thamnoophis spp.) of Indiana typically have conspicuous stripes along their green to black bodies. Some species also have spots or a checkerboard pattern. Indiana is home to a few species of water snake. The northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon sipedon) and midland water snake (Nerodia sipedon pleuralis) inhabit the north half and south half of the state, respectively. Sometimes mistaken for copperheads or cottonmouths due to their dark-brown-and-tan pattern, these snakes are completely harmless. The queen snake (Regina septemvittata) is an olive-green to olive-brown color with a distinctly yellow belly. Kirtland's water snake (Clonophis kirtlandi) is an endangered species found in the northern two-thirds of the state.

(AP) — Authorities seized nearly two dozen weapons, silencers and some 35,000 rounds of ammunition at the Southern California home of a person who turned into forbidden to personal guns due to.', ""The 9mm or 9×19mm Parabellum is a firearms cartridge that was designed by Georg Luger and introduced in 1902 by the German weapons manufacturer Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) (German Weapons and Munitions Factory) for their Luger semi-automatic pistol. For this reason, it is designated as the 9mm Luger by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute (SAAMI), and the 9mm Luger by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l’Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP). The name Parabellum is derived from the Latin: Si vis pacem, para bellum (“If you seek peace, prepare for war”), which was the motto of DWM. Under STANAG 4090, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. According to the 2014 edition of Cartridges of the World, the 9×19mm Parabellum is “the world’s most popular and widely used military handgun and submachinegun cartridge.” In addition to being used by over 60% of police in the U.S., Newsweek credits 9×19mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers. The popularity of this cartridge can be attributed to the widely held conviction that it is effective in police and self-defense use. Its low cost and wide availability contribute to the caliber’s continuing popularity. The round was originally designed to be lethal to 50 meters, but is still lethal at longer ranges. The 9mm cartridge combines a flat trajectory with moderate recoil. According to the 1986 book Handloading: “the modern science of wound ballistics has established beyond reasonable doubt that the 9mm cartridge is highly effective.” In 2014, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a report detailing the potential combat effectiveness of the 9mm cartridge when compared to other calibers such as the .45 ACP and the .40 S&W cartridge that was specifically developed for use by the FBI. The report indicated that the new powders and more advanced bullet designs used in current 9mm defensive loads allowed for the caliber to deliver almost similar performance to other calibers, like the .45 ACP, and .40 S&W. In addition to this, the lower recoil, less wear, cheaper ammunition and higher capacity were all reasons that the report cited for the recent surge in orders of the ammunition from various police agencies. With a wider selection of officers being able to shoot handguns chambered in 9×19mm, many departments choose this caliber so they can standardize around a single firearm and loading, making logistics and supply easier. Due to all of these factors, law enforcement orders of 9mm ammo from all major ammunition manufacturers have spiked significantly. The FBI report made it clear that the more consistent accuracy of 9mm in the hands of their less experienced shooters was a factor in their returning to 9mm as their standard handgun caliber. It was also made clear that the almost same effectiveness of 9mm compared to .40 S&W and .45 ACP was due to the high quality of 9mm ammunition available.

when did the virginia colony become a state,"['', 'Americans pay a percentage of their taxes to the Queen of England via the IRS.\xa0The IRS is not an agency of the Federal Government. It is an agency of the International Monetary Fund which is an agency of the United Nations. No law has ever been passed legalizing the charging of income tax. The 1040 tax form is the payment of a foreign tax to the King/Queen of England. American citizens have been in financial servitude to the British Monarch since the Treaty of 1783 and the War of Dependence. All tax payers have an Individual Master File and are held liable for a tax via a treaty between the U.S. and the U.K. and payable to the U.K. Prior to 1991, the Business Master File in 6209 was U.S.-U.K. Tax Claims, non-refile DLN. That means that everyone is considered a business and involved in commerce. The first Federal income tax in the United States occurred during the civil war, through the passage of The Revenue Act of 1861: three percent for those making between $600 and $10,000, and five percent for those making over $10,000. This income tax was repealed ten years later. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, ruled that the Federal income tax violated the U.S. Constitution because it was a direct tax on individuals and not apportioned between the States, required by the Constitution. The Constitution protects individuals against the abuse of Federal government power by stripping from the FEDs\xa0the power to tax individuals, knowing the power to tax is the power to destroy. So the Federal power-seekers sought to overrule our forefathers and to empower the Federal Government, (that is, our US Federal Corporation, hereinafter, “The FEDS”) with the power to tax individuals through the 16th Amendment. The ratification of the 16th Amendment is dubious. In 1913, the same year British agents steered through Congress the FED fraud on the night before Christmas Eve, the 16th Amendment was hatched. But the founders made changing the Constitution difficult, to say the least. One of two ways to alter our founding document requires any proposed Constitutional Amendment be ratified by three-fourths of the States. Fraud and deceit were the hallmarks of this “ratification” process. At the time there were 48 States. More than 13 States either did not ratify the 16th Amendment, or it was fraudulently reported by a State Secretary of State as ratified, when it in fact was not.\xa0(The Law That Never Was)\xa0Ohio was counted as a ratifying State, even though Ohio did not lawfully become a State until Eisenhower signed an order in the 1950s. Then this Federal court turned around and threatened attorneys that raised the illegal ratification issue with court fines if any dared\xa0raise the issue again – as if some cabal-stooge in a Secretary of State position can substitute his signature for the proper and legal ratification of an entire State — what gall! Federal Judges who placate Globalists by trampling the Constitution will have hell to pay, to be sure. Even if the 16th Amendment had been legally passed, it did “not change the constitutional limitations which forbid any direct taxation of individuals.” (U.S. Supreme Court in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Rail Road Co. 240 U.S. 1 (1916).) Nor did the 16th Amendment purport to overrule the prohibition on direct taxation elsewhere in our Constitution. Like every nefarious encroachment by our government, The FEDs roll it out slowly over time to acclimate us to their society-destroying power-grabbing plans. The U.S. income tax started out only soaking the rich. The Federal tax rate was in the single digits for those making under $250,000 in household income, and was capped at 15% for those making over $2 million. Today, of course, The FEDs\xa0have slowly inched their tentacles deeper and deeper into the pockets of the US middle class, at a time when the “Federal” “Reserve” “Bank” has decimated the value of the dollar down to fifteen cents. The FED’s taxation of the people of the United States violates the protection our forefathers assured through our Constitution: that historical document created solely to check an out-of-control Federal Government. Making The FEDs the single biggest beneficiary of every middle class family paycheck has long caused our forefathers to roll over in their graves. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), aka the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was never created by any Act of Congress. It is not an agency of the Department of Treasury. The only mention of the IRS appears in 31 U.S.C. Sec. 301-315 stating that the President is authorized to appoint an Assistant General Counsel in the U.S. Department of Treasury to be the Chief Counsel for the IRS. In the 1979 case Chrysler v. Brown (441 U.S. 281), the U.S. Supreme Court admitted that, after searching back to the Civil War, no organic Act for the IRS could be found. The Guarantee Clause in the Constitution establishes a Federal rule of law (Article IV, Sec. 4). We are supposed to be a nation of laws — not\xa0aNation of Globalists’ edicts. The IRS is not a US agency because there is no US law creating it. The IRS is a fraud, a charade, bilking us only because we’ve let them get away with it. The IRS is Puerto Rican Trusts operated by the Secretary of the Treasury, as the Trustee. The settler and beneficiaries of these trusts are unknown, and, conveniently enough, the Puerto Rican laws governing trusts keeps these entities secret. Although concealed, according to US Code 31, Chapter 3, the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are all one organization. Acquired by conquest, the US gained possession of the Philippine Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico. The Philippine Customs Administrative Act was passed by the Philippine Commission between 1900 to 1902. It was created to regulate trade with foreign countries and to impose custom duties and excise taxes. This Act created the Federal government’s first trust fund, Trust Fund #1 (US Code 31, Sec. 1321) and was administered under the general control of the Secretary of Finance and Justice. In 1904 another Act was passed that created Trust Fund #2 and was known as The Bureau of Internal Revenue (US Code 31, Sec. 1321, Article I, Sec. 2 & 3): “There shall be established a Bureau of Internal Revenue, the chief officer of which Bureau shall be known as the Collector of Internal Revenue. He shall be appointed by the Civil Governor, with the advice and consent of the Philippine Commission, and shall receive a salary at the rate of eight thousand pesos per annum. The Bureau of Internal Revenue shall belong to the department of Finance and Justice.” “The Collector of Internal Revenue, under the direction of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, shall have general superintendence of the assessment and collection of all taxes and excises imposed by this Act or by any Act amendatory thereof, and shall perform such other duties as may be required by law.” This in effect made the Customs Administrative Act within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines, merging the two to be responsible for “all taxes and excises imposed by this Act” — import and export excise taxes. Prior to 1940, another Bureau of Internal Revenue was created in Puerto Rico and known as Trust Fund #62. Under the Reorganization Plan #3 of 1940 (US Code 5, Section 903), the Federal Alcohol Administration (created to enforce prohibition of alcohol) was abolished and their functions transferred to the Secretary of Treasury through the BIR. Although the history has been removed from the older editions of the USC, it can be deduced that the Federal Alcohol Administration was absorbed by the Puerto Rico Trust #62. The China Trade Act was passed between 1904 and 1938 and dealt with opium, cocaine and citric wines shipped out of China, which appeared to be administered in the Philippines by the BIR. The Code of Federal Regulations of the USA, Title 26 Internal Revenue, Chapter I, references for the first time terms such as income, credits, withholding, assessment and collection and failure to file a return. However, the entire substance of Title 26 applies to foreign individuals, foreign corporations, foreign ships, income from sources within the possessions of the United States, and citizens and domestic corporations of the US that derived income from sources within the possessions of the US. All taxes covered by these laws were for imposts, excise taxes and duties to be collected by the BIR for narcotics, alcohol, tobacco and firearms. The IRS Act of 1939 applied to all taxes and duties collected on trade between US possessions (Philippines, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands) and foreign individuals, corporations and governments. A point of fact is that Al Capone was not jailed for income tax evasion — he was jailed for unpaid tax due on alcohol imported from Canada! Passed by Congress for the years 1943 to 1944, the Victory Tax Act duped patriotic Americans into paying taxes to support winning World War II. The federal government created the clever lie that this tax applied to all Americans by sending out tax form 1040 to everyone. In fact, only employees of the federal government, residents of the District of Columbia, residents of naval bases, residents of forts, US citizens of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, territories and possessions were lawfully required to file and pay the Victory Tax. When the Victory Tax law expired in 1944, the news media never announced it to the public, and so the devious Federal government simply continued sending out 1040 forms in spite of the fact that no citizen of the 50 Union States was ever liable to pay the tax in the first place. In 1953, the US surrendered control over the Philippines. Many questions remain about Trusts #1 (customs duties) and Trust #2 (internal revenue), such as why they continue to be administered to this day, and who exactly are the settlers and beneficiaries of the trusts. It is no coincidence that in 1953, the Secretary of Treasury, G.K. Humphrey, under no legal authority but his own, changed the name of the BIR to Internal Revenue Service, by signing Treasury Order 150-06. Whether Humphrey changed the BIR’s name in the Philippines or in Puerto Rico is unknown. Without the approval of Congress or the President, Humphrey illegally turned the Trust(s) into a Department of Treasury agency. No one opposed or even so much as challenged it. In 1954, the US and Guam became partners under the Mutual Security Act. The IRS Code of 1954 was also passed and coordinated “Individual Income Tax” for the US and Guam. Since the Constitution forbids un-apportioned direct taxes on the people of the United States, the Federal government had to trick people into volunteering to pay taxes as U.S. citizens of either Guam, Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands. Fast forward to 1972 when, again with no legal authority, Acting Secretary of Treasury, Charles E. Walker, signed Treasury Order 120-01, establishing The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF). Walker apparently branched the IRS, creating the BATF, and then joined them back together into one. The Federal Register, Vol. 41, #180 (1976) states: “The terms ‘Director, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division’ has been replaced by the term ‘Internal Revenue Service’.” “The terms ‘Director, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division’ and ‘Commissioner of Internal Revenue’ wherever used in regulations, rules, and instructions, and forms, issued or adopted for the administration and enforcement of the laws specified in paragraph 2 hereof, which are in effect or in use on the effective date of this Order, shall be held to mean ‘the Director’.” Walker created the BATF from Humphrey’s Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Internal Revenue Service. He then maintains that what he transferred is the same “thing” as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Knowing he had no authority from Congress or the President, Walker made it appear that he had done something he had not done. To compound this fraud, the Federal Register published that a person was replaced by a thing: “the term Director Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division has been replaced with the term Internal Revenue Service.” In 1935 when the Federal Alcohol Act (prohibition) was ruled unconstitutional within the 50 States, the functions of the Federal Alcohol Administration then became administered by the Secretary of Treasury through the BIR, an offshore Trust. The BIR became the IRS, and the IRS then gave birth to the BATF. On September 15, 1976, a signature somehow turned the position of Director of the BATF into the IRS. To summarize, there is no such organization within the Department of Treasury known as “The Internal Revenue Service” or the “Bureau of Tobacco and Firearms.” In Title 31 USC stating the laws applicable to the Department of Treasury and listing the organizations belonging to it, there is no IRS or BATF\xa0listed. However, both the IRS (Puerto Rico Trust #62) and BATF, are listed as entities “to be audited” by the Controller General and both are referred to as having office(s) in Puerto Rico. The IRS Code of 1939, aka IRS Code of 1954, pertains solely to tobacco and firearms taxes, administered by the IRS — alias BIR, alias Virgin Islands Bureau of Internal Revenue, alias Director ATF Division, alias IRS. There is No Law Requiring The People of The United States To Pay Taxes To The IRS. It’s always difficult to prove a negative, but those who know, understand there has been no law requiring citizens of The United States of America to pay taxes to any Federal Agency, much less \xa0Puerto Rican Trusts with secret owners. According to 44 USC, every regulation or rule must be published in the Federal Register and must be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. If there is no regulation, there is no implementation of the law. There can be found: no regulation governing “failure to file a return”; no regulation governing “failure to file,” and no computer code for “failure to file.” Oddly enough, there is a requirement stating where to file an income tax return, and 26 C.F.R., Section 1.6091-3 states that “Income tax returns are required to be filed with the Director of International Operations.” Note the word “International.” Who is this Director? No one in the IRS or BATF has any authority to do what they have been doing all these years. The 1986 Delegation Order #115 states that only the IRS and BATF can conduct audits, but only audits of themselves for $750 or less. Any audit above that amount must be done by the Controller General. No IRS or BATF agent or representative can provide any law, rule or regulation that gives them authority to audit anyone but themselves. Per 26 CFR, Section 1.6001-1(d), no one is required to keep records or file returns unless specifically notified by the district director by notice served to make such returns, render such statements or keep such specific records as will enable the district director to determine whether or not such person is liable for tax under Subtitle A of the Code. Furthermore, this rule also applies to State individual income taxes, where “State” solely refers to the District of Columbia, US Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, territories and insular possessions. IRS Service Publication 6209 lists computer code “TC 150” for Virgin Island returns, and Codes 300-398 are listed as US and UK Tax Treaty claims for taxes on narcotics that are financed in the Cayman Islands and imported into the Virgin Islands. When people having tax problems with the IRS file a Freedom of Information Act requesting their “Individual Master File” (IMF), every return has these computer codes except for the Guam returns. Every return shows that the citizen is being taxed on income that came from importing narcotics, alcohol, tobacco or firearms in the US or one of its territories/possessions, from a foreign country, or from Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands or into the Virgin Islands from the Cayman Islands. 26 C.F.R, Sec. 601.103(a) is the only reference to who is required to file a return, provided that the person has been properly noticed by the District Director to both keep records and is required to file. Have you ever been sent a notice from the District Director to keep records and file a return? If you write or print your name on a line marked “taxpayer,” you become the taxpayer. Since these forms are affidavits, you commit a crime when you fill out the form confirming what you are not, a taxpayer. You are a Citizen of the United States of America and subject to the laws of the Constitution of the United States of America. “The scam manifests itself in many different ways. In order to maintain the semblance of legality, hats are changed from moment to moment. When you are told to submit records for examination, you are dealing with Customs. When you submit an offer in compromise, you are dealing with the Coast Guard. When you are confronted by a Special Agent of the IRS, you are really dealing with a deputized United States Marshall. When you are being investigated by the alleged Internal Revenue Service, you are really dealing with an agent contracted by the Justice Department to investigate narcotics violations. When the alleged Internal Revenue Service charges you with a crime, you are dealing with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Only a small part of 26 U.S.C. is administered by the alleged Internal Revenue Service. “Most of the Code is administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, including Chapters 61 through 80, which is enforcement. In addition, 27 C.F.R. is BATF, and states in Subpart B, Definitions, 250.11, Meaning of terms: ‘United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office — Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in Puerto Rico.’ Every person we find who is being prosecuted by the alleged Internal Revenue Service has a code on their IMF [Individual Master File] which puts them in “tax class 6,” which designates that they have violated a law relating to alcohol, tobacco, or firearms, in Puerto Rico.” \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0William Cooper, 1995. While the U.S. Department of Justice has the power of attorney to represent federal agencies in federal court, it has no legal authority to represent the IRS since it is not a legal agency. Furthermore, the governments of all federal territories are specifically excluded from the definition of a “federal agency” by Act of Congress (5 U.S.C. 551(1)(C). Since the IRS is domiciled in Puerto Rico, it is by definition not a federal agency that can be represented by the Department of Justice. However, because the President has the authority to appoint IRS Chief Counsel, he/she can appoint a delegate to appear in federal court on behalf of the IRS and IRS employees. The chain of command\xa0starts with Congress, then flows to the President, then to IRS Chief Counsel – not to the Department of Justice. We have become a people ruled by tax laws passed by the rich and for the rich where no law exists that requires taxes to be paid. The IRS gets away with its brutal enforcement of this scam because the Federal courts have, case after case, refused to hold them accountable. Consistently the due process afforded to us by our Constitution is completely violated, with property and records being confiscated so that Americans are helpless to defend themselves against the IRS and their weapons. The 2013 Tax Advocate Service annual report bemoans IRS criminal collection practices, which were ruled illegal by Federal courts, but just ignored and continued by the IRS. IRS lawyers, federal judges and IRS personnel and appointees habitually lie in court cases to perpetuate IRS fraud. And, as has been widely reported by the IRS targeting of the Obama Administration’s political enemies, the IRS has been turned into a political weapon of mass destruction that would make Nixon blush. And don’t you believe the whitewash investigation by the Administration’s wolf in the people’s chicken coop: Over the years, the IRS’ fraudulent publications, misapplied tax code and deliberate omissions have trained lawyers and judges to continue this fraud by unwittingly paying taxes for which we are clearly not liable. We allow our liberties and our living to be confiscated and pillaged by the lawless, criminal ruling class to the extent\xa0to which we allow lawyers and judges to willfully misapply tax laws. According to the 2013 Tax Advocate Service annual report the taxpayer has just a 2% chance of success if they challenge the IRS. William Cooper: “We have been betrayed by those we trusted. We have been robbed of our money and property. It happened because we trusted imperfect men to rule imperfect men, and we failed in our duty as watchdogs. It happened because we have been ignorant, apathetic and even stupid.” It is essential for all Americans to become aware of the history of the IRS and understand how one lie has been compounded by countless other lies to brainwash Americans into paying taxes that they clearly are not liable to pay. The IRS is a criminal, thug organization that is out of control. By all accounts, the IRS first puts the money into a “Quad Zero” account under an Individual Master File, after which time it can apparently do whatever it wants with the money. Sometimes it is dispersed under Treasury Order #91 (Rev. 1, 1986), which is a service agreement between the IRS and the Agency for International Development (USAID). In accordance with the international agreement that created the International Monetary Fund, the Secretary of Treasury is the U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund and is paid by them. The International Monetary Fund came into existence at the United Nations Monetary and Financial\xa0conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944 and the US became a member in 1945 (U.S.C. Title 22, Sec. 286). So what is funding our federal government? Tax researcher, Richard Standring (now deceased) believed that the US funds itself with loans from the International Monetary Fund. Following checks naming the IRS as the payee, Standring found that the checks go to a Federal Reserve bank. The money then flows to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and is deposited into the “Quad Zero” account, which is the account from which the IRS distributes refunds (per 22 U.S.C. 286 and 31 CFR 11, Sec. 214.7) According to Standring’s research, whatever is left over is then transferred to the International Monetary Fund and subsequently redistributed in the form of loans to countries around the world, including the US. These loans must then be paid back with interest to International Monetary Fund bankers. Our own money is being used for loans, even to our own country, which we have to pay back with interest to the International Monetary Fund. What portion of our national debt does this account for? It may be impossible to accurately determine how much American tax dollars have been funneled to the International Monetary Fund, or given away by the Federal Reserve Bank to foreign banks, or how much money the government has illegally siphoned off for black-ops, false flags, payoffs to lobbyists and Congressmen, and for assassinations of presidents (domestic and foreign), scientists and whistleblowers. However, what can be documented is that for 240 years, a large portion of our tax dollars – and countless American lives — have gone to line the pockets of the multi-national military industrial complex. It is evident the FEDs has perpetually kept our country at war and conflict. They have done this by keeping Americans feeling under eternal threat, both at home and worldwide, thereby justifying taxes for what is made to appear as desperately-needed protection. Nothing reveals this deadly con game against the American people more than the 9/11 false flag and the resulting years of the “War on Terror,” which is nothing more than a euphemism for a war against the people — against our standard of living, against our paychecks, our rights, our health and our safety. They will take everything, unless we wake up, join forces, stand and fight them to the death. They cannot win against us all. There are now movements afoot to mount a massive new class-action suit against the IRS. We applaud these efforts and would add a clarion call to all patriotic American lawyers who have the courage and fortitude to stand up for American citizens and flood the courts with lawsuits to reveal the illegality of the income tax, expose the IRS for its criminal fraud and force the courts to uphold our U.S. Constitution. The elite have long relied upon our not knowing the truth and not knowing what to do. Now that we know the truth, will we continue to allow them to take our money and ask “but what can I do?” At our inception as a country we freed ourselves from tyranny, and we must do it again — monumental change will be achieved by We The People joining together. In\xa01604, the\xa0Virginia Company\xa0was formed with the purpose of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. Its main stockholder was British King James I. The Virginia Company owned most of the land that is now called the USA. The Virginia Company of the British Crown had rights to 50%, yes 50%, of all gold and silver mined on its lands, plus percentages of other minerals and raw materials, and 5% of all profits from other ventures. The lands of the British owned Virginia Company were granted to the American colonies under a Deed of Trust (lease) and therefore – they could not claim ownership of the land. They could pass on the perpetual use of the land to their heirs or sell the perpetual use of the land, but they could NEVER own it. The Virginia Company formed two companies. The “Virginia Company of London” and the “Virginia Company of Plymouth” operating with identical charters but covering different territories. The Plymouth Company never fulfilled its charter and its territory became New England. A successor company to the Plymouth Company eventually established a permanent settlement in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620 in what is now\xa0New England. In 1624, the\xa0King dissolved the London Company and made Virginia a “royal colony”. In\xa01773, the United States ratified a contract in which loans were owed to the\xa0British Crown. The purpose of the loans were to fund both sides of the War of Independence. “All bills of credit omitted, monies borrowed and debts contracted by or under the authority of congress before the assembling of the US in pursuance of the present confederation, shall be deemed and considered a charge against the US for payment and satisfaction where of the US and public and public faith are hereby solemnly pledged”. After 1776, the Virginia royal colony became the Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the original thirteen states of the United States, adopting as its official slogan “The Old Dominion”. After the United States was formed, the entire states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, and portions of Ohio were all later created from the territory encompassed earlier by the Colony of Virginia. Ownership was retained by the British Crown. The First Bank of the\xa0United States\xa0was created in 1791 and chartered for 20 years but was not renewed due to public outrage over policy. Rothschild banking system to enter the U.S. behind George Washington’s back. Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. International bankers saw that interest-free scrip would keep America free of their influence, so by 1781 banker-backed Alexander Hamilton succeeded in starting the Bank of America. After a few years of “bank money”, the prosperity of “Colonial Scrip” was gone. Benjamin Franklin said, “Conditions were so reversed that the era of prosperity had ended and a depression set in to such an extent that the streets of the Colonies were filled with the unemployed!” Bank money was like our FED money. It had debt and interest attached. By 1790 Hamilton and his bankers had created a privately owned central bank and converted the public debt (interest-free) into interest bearing bonds, payable to the bankers. When Hamilton’s bank charter expired in 1811, the international bankers started the war of 1812. “I have\xa0never\xa0known the prejudice in favor of birth, parentage and descent, more conspicuous than in the instance of Col. Burr. That gentleman was connected by blood with many respectable families in New England.\xa0. . . \xa0He had served in the army, and came out of it with the character of a knight without fear, and an able officer.”\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0– – – President John Adams On the uniforms of US troops, in Federal buildings, criminal courts, and even when the US President is giving a speech, the US national flag always displays a gold fringe. The gold fringe stands for British Maritime Law, Military Law and Martial Law. The flag with the gold or yellow fringe has no US constitution, no US laws, and no US rules of court. It is not recognized by any nation on earth. It is foreign to you and the United States of America. After the American War of (In)Dependence, the King’s corporation changed names from the Virginia Company to the United States Of America, the USA and the US. The United States of America is not a country. It is a corporation and it is owned by the British Crown. Britain created the illusion that it lost its North American colony, but\xa0in reality, it exchanged overt control for covert control.

The Southern Colonies of British America comprised the Province of Maryland, the Colony of Virginia, the Province of Carolina (which was split into North and South Carolina in 1712), and the Province of Georgia. Until the Spanish Empire reclaimed Florida, Great Britain would join the recently founded provinces of East Florida and West Florida to the Southern Colonies in 1763.

These are ready-to-use Southern Colonies worksheets that are perfect for teaching students about the British colonies in the south, which focused on the production of cash crops like tobacco and sugar, which resulted in large populations of enslaved Africans in these colonies as well as social stratification between wealthy white plantation owners and poor white and black laborers. The Southern Colonies of British America comprised the Province of Maryland, the Colony of Virginia, the Province of Carolina (which was split into North and South Carolina in 1712), and the Province of Georgia. Until the Spanish Empire reclaimed Florida, Great Britain would join the recently founded provinces of East Florida and West Florida to the Southern Colonies in 1763. Carolina was first established as an English and then a British colony in North America in 1608. On March 24, 1663, a new charter was granted to a group of eight English noblemen known as the Lord’s Proprietors since the first charter had yet to be realized and had been deemed illegitimate. Due to their tropical setting, the Southern Colonies had hot summers and comfortable winters. The topography ranged from coastal plains in the east to the piedmont farther interior, with most western parts being mountainous. The economy of the South was mostly centered on agriculture. Cash crops included rice, indigo, tobacco, sugarcane, and cotton. Large plantations where enslaved people and indentured servants toiled grew crops. In the 1700s, Charleston, South Carolina, developed as one of the critical hubs of the American slave trade. Native Americans who had already occupied the area resisted the Virginia Colony. The Powhatan tribes, a group of Native American tribes, commanded by Powhatan, saw the colonists as invaders and made an effort to drive them out.

It is available on-line as the sample chapter of The Imago Sequence and Other Stories on the Baen ebooks site. Page numbers used throughout refer to the paperback version. The title “Old Virginia” refers both to Virginia, the old crone, and the state of (West) Virginia, the setting of the story, and the first (and oldest) British colonial possession in North America (which encompassed the current states of Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, and portions of Ohio and Pennsylvania). Lucky Strike was the top-selling cigarettes brand in the US during the 1930s, and was still being sold as of 2016. It was one of the brands included in rations provided to US soldiers in WWII.Barron has used them in other stories to provide historical flavour.\xa0Consider this quote from The Light is the Darkness: I presume that some specific works (films, novels, short stories) make the connection between Lucky Strikes and CIA operatives, but I am not familiar with them. During the Cold War, in the United States and elsewhere, ""red"" was used as a political adjective to refer to the USSR and, more broadly, to communists. Agents of one intelligence agency who have infiltrated another intelligence agency are known as moles. Molehunts, as the efforts directed at finding such agents were known, were endemic in theCentral Intelligence Agency while James Jesus Angleton was head of the Counterintelligence Staff (1954-1974). Chuckling is discussed more fully in the post ""On Chuckling"". To gibber is to speak rapidly and unintelligibly. This is a common trope in horror fiction: the protagonist dismisses evidence that does not fit the frame in which he presumes he is operating until it becomes impossible to do so. While there is an artist by that name, the author has stated in private correspondence that ""Roger Garland"" is not a reference to anyone in particular. If the name is a reference to a particular person, I\'m not aware of it. Nicotine is widely used as a coping mechanism to deal with stress and anxiety. Self-medication, the idea that people use substances to ease the symptoms of stress and anxiety, is frequently present in Laird\'s stories. Tobacco and alcohol are the most frequently used substances.\xa0Smoking was far more common in the 1950s. Smoking prevalence in men in 1955 was 56.9%, and only 20.5% in 2013, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. I don’t know if the name refers to a particular person. The Cuban Revolution, led by Fidel Castro against the U.S.-backed Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, started in 1953.I was unable to find information about any overt or covert U.S. military involvement in Cuba in 1953. The operation described in this story is likely fictional, but I welcome any information to the contrary. The story is set in 1959. See discussion section for more about Roger Garland’s preoccupation with age. Strauss is a common Germanic surname. If this is a reference to a particular person, I am unaware of it. The Iron Curtain is the line through Europe after WWII, dividing the two sides of the Cold War: the Soviet Union and its allies opposed by the United States and its allies. It ""fell"" in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which signalled the end of the Cold War. Project TALLHAT is not a real project, to the best of my knowledge. Its name may derive from the tall, pointed hats associated with witchcraft in popular culture. Whether there is a historical association is a matter of some controversy. (See “Hallucigenia” for an example of a similar hat in Laird’s stories.) The project gets a brief mention in The Light is the Darkness.The Company refers to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Employees reportedly use that term when referring to the organization, as do insiders and those who wish others to think they are insiders.Black ops, or black operations, are covert operations which are not attributable to the organization carrying them out, funding them, or both. I don’t know if the names Porter or Riley refer to anyone in particular. Langley, Virginia, is home to the headquarters of the CIA. The first big war is an allusion to World War I (1914-1918). There are 10 people in the isolated cabin in the woods: the five named above, Roger Garland, Hatcher, Doctor Porter, Doctor Riley, and the crone. If the names Dox, Robey, and Davis refer to particular people, I am not aware of it. If this refers to an actual location, I am unaware of it. The San Andreas Fault forms the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. It runs partly through California. Notable earthquakes include the 1906 earthquake that caused the fire which destroyed 80% of San Francisco. MK-ULTRA was an illegal CIA program of human experiments designed to identify means of controlling human behaviour through the use of drugs, interrogation techniques, torture, and other means. It is popularly known as the CIA mind-control program. It began in 1953 and was officially halted in 1973. According to the Virginia Department of Forestry, most leaves in Virginia have fallen by mid-November. Dwight Eisenhower was president from 1953 to 1961, winning the 1952 and 1956 elections. He was a five-star general in the United States Army during WWII. Eisenhower had a mild stroke on November 25, 1957. ""Ike"", meant as an abbreviation of his last name, was a family nickname. It was immortalized in the 1952 campaign slogan ""I like Ike"". Richard Nixon was vice-president from 1953 to 1961, and president from 1969 to 1974. I was unable to find corroboration for the claim that Eisenhower drew caricatures of Nixon, or that the stroke significantly affected his mental faculties. Badger Hill is a settlement and mine in California, and there is a Badger Hill farm in Virginia, but I could find no mountain of that name in the state. The Blue Ridge Mountains, part of the Appalachian Mountain chain, divide Virginia and West Virginia, running SW-NE. There are abandoned coal mines in the mountainous region of the state, enough of them for the Department of Mines and Energy to provide an interactive map detailing their locations. The Korean War was fought between 1950 and 1953. Soissons is a French town in the northern department of Picardy. The Battle of Soissons in 1918 was fought between the German and French armies, with American support on the French side. The United States did not join the war until 1917. Roger’s presence there in 1915 implies work for another government, or a covert operation.Normandy is a northern region of France. The Allied invasion of German-occupied Normandy in June 1944 contributed to their victory on the Western Front. I’m not aware of a specific operation which would have required his presence in the region in 1945.See previous note for Roger’s involvement in Cuba in 1953. Nitroglycerin (C3H5N3O9), in addition to its use in the manufacture of explosives, has been used medically as a vasodilator for 130 years. It is used for the treatment of angina and other heart conditions. In many of Laird’s stories, science and magic seem to exist along a continuum. This is beautifully evoked with the copper circlet, with its echoes of protective talismans and magic circles, and its trailing wires, clear evidence of a technological purpose. LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide, known colloquially as “acid” is a psychedelic drug. The CIA did study the effects of LSD in the course of their MK ULTRA research program.Photokinesis is movement in reaction to light. In parapsychology, it is the purported ability to mentally manipulate light. The KGB (Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti) was the Soviet Union security agency from 1954 to 1991. The California Institute of Technology is a private university in Pasadena, California. Peyote is a cactus from which mescaline and other psychoactive alkaloids are derived. It has a long history of ritual and recreational thanks to its psychedelic properties. I could not find any information about this group, which may be an informal nickname, and is in any case probably fictional. The iconic black flag with skull and crossbones flown by pirate ships about to attack is traditionally known as the Jolly Roger. The scientific props, here and elsewhere, serve to naturalize the supernatural elements of the story. Roger’s visceral reaction is interesting. The threat is perceived instinctively, reflexively, before becoming an object of conscious thought. More self-medication. In comic books published by Marvel Comics, Weapon X is a secret (Canadian) government project which turns individuals into superpowered weapons. The popular superhero characters Wolvering, Sabertooth, and Deadpool, among others, were the result of this project. It was first mentioned in 1974. (p.7) The First World War began on 28 July 1914 and ended on 11 November 1918. The German army entered France in August 1914. That would place Roger Garland\'s date of birth in 1886, which would make him 73 during the events of the story. I was unable to find a college or university named “Rogers and Williams.” It could be that I’m misreading the sentence, or that the institution is fictional. If anyone can provide a clarification, I would appreciate it. The U.S. entered the war officially on 6 April 1917. These elements of Garland\'s story I find problematic. The Germans did not successfully invade France in WWI. The Resistance was a reaction to the German occupation of France following the 1940 armistice signed between the two countries. While tanks (""armor"") were used by the Allies and Germans late in world war I, they did not see widespread use until WWII.Three plausible explanations for these discrepancies suggest themselves:a) Garland is mistaken. He is misremembering events that occurred during WWII.b) Garland is not mistaken. He is relating events that occurred differently in his timeline than in ours.c) Laird mistakenly introduced anachronistic elements into the story. This appears to be a misspelling of Robey, which is repeated on p.11. A migraine is a severe, disabling headache accompanied by other neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances and photophobia.""Migraine"" is another Barronism. Exposure to “weirdness” (for lack of a better term) often results in migraines for the protagonists of Laird Barron stories. In this collection, no fewer than five protagonists\xa0experience them, while no character suffers a mundane ""headaches"". Auschwitz was the site of a German concentration camp during WWII, in what is now Poland. It is estimated that 1.1 million prisoners died in the camp, 90% of them Jewish. The remainder being Poles, Romani, Soviets, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, and others. Many were killed in the gas chambers installed there, but others succumbed to starvation, forced labour, execution, infectious diseases, and medical experiments. German doctors performed many barbaric medical experiments on the prisoners. The most infamous doctor at Auschwitz was Josef Mengele, who was particularly interested in identical twins and dwarfs. Defined by Merriam-Webster as “a highly respected and admired man who has had a long career in a particular field.” Timbuktu is a city in the West-African country of Mali. Located on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, it became known in Europe through legendary tales of its fabulous wealth, and it subsequently for its remoteness and mystery. It has entered popular usage as a metaphor for a faraway place. Clairvoyance is the purported ability to gain information (often visual) through extrasensory perception. Remote viewing programs were established by the U.S. Army (Stargate Project) and the CIA (program SCANATE) in the 1970s. A 1995 report commissioned by the CIA found that it had not been proven to work, and was not used operationally. This has not discouraged writers from making hay with the possibilities implicit in such a program. A mimeograph machine produced duplicate copies of a document by forcing ink through a stencil onto a sheet of paper. It was widely used before the advent of the photocopier in the 1960s. This is a fictional book, as far as I can tell. Carolina refers to what are now North and South Carolina. North Carolina borders Virginia to the south.The Lost Roanoke Colony vanished from the Raleigh Township on Roanoke Island between 1588 and 1589. The island is not far from the Virginia / North Carolina border.The story of the Lost Roanoke Colony presented here is mostly accurate. The colony was established in 1587 by 115 men, women, and children. The first child born to the colony was Virginia Dare, grand-daughter of the Governor White mentioned in the citation. Laird is again establishing the idea that the supernatural can be understood scientifically. Another interpretation would be that the intelligent supernatural entities are consciously using the bait of scientific knowledge in order to lure chosen human individuals. The theme of supernatural creatures using (scientific) curiosity to ensnare humans is one that Barron returns to with regularity. The roots of the idea are ancient (see: Garden of Eden, Faust) but the presentation is fresh. Premonitory, symbolic, and/or frightening dreams are a frequent used device in Barron’s stories. They serve a similar function to the physical reactions noted previously. For the protagonist, they are warnings from the subconscious about an upcoming danger. For the reader, they are warnings from the author that the character is in danger. From a practical standpoint, dreams are useful for introducing information which the protagonist and the reader would otherwise be denied. The events unfold at a pace dictated by the antagonist. She is in complete control of the situation from the start. Rank: having a strong, unpleasant smell. (Merriam-Webster) Horror and disgust are difficult to dissociate. Unpleasant smells are also bound up in the concept of corruption, both physical and metaphysical. This is a suggestive image. See discussion for more details. The irony in the first statement is that, while this is in many ways the story of a Faustian bargain, Strauss is playing the part of Faust, not the devil.\xa0Machiavelli was an Italian Renaissance politician, diplomat, historian, and writer. He is remembered for his book The Prince\xa0in which he laid out the principles by which a ruler could retain power, through calculated and occasionally immoral means. Dresden is a city in eastern Germany. In February 1945, it was bombed with high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices by British and American planes. The bombing and the resultant firestorm destroyed the city centre and killing an estimated 22-25 thousand people. Caves and fissures are a recurring motif in mythology and folklore, where they are frequently openings leading to other worlds. Here the hole leads to an otherworldly creature, and its “opening” is suggestive of the opening jaws of a predator, or the opening of a trap or snare. The number tallies well with the missing Roanoke colonists (115). The historical record is silent about their ultimate fate. While death from starvation or assimilation into local tribes are likelier, Laird provides this glimpse at an alternative possibility. A tendril is the thin spirally coiling stem of a climbing plant that attaches to walls, fences, etc. (Merriam-Webster)A susurration is a whispering sound, a murmur. (Merriam-Webster)A pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant with a prey-trapping mechanism filled with digestive fluid. There is a lot to unpack in this paragraph. Given that many of the other stories in the collection will expand on these ideas, and that I’ll be looking at a few of them in the discussion, I’ll simply flag it and move on.Provender\xa0is an evocative Barronism. It is a dated term which refers to food for livestock or domestic animals, synonymous with “feed”. It is derived from medieval latinprebendia\xa0(a stipend allotted to someone) and providere\xa0(to provide). Barron gives it a sinister context: we can infer that Mother is a creature for which food is provided on a regular basis. It reduces humans to the humble role of nutrients. It is quite simply a dehumanizing term. We can infer that CROATOAN is Mother’s name. This raises a host of questions about language and culture in non-human sentient beings, but we will have to wait for answers. See previous note on Virginia. This idea is developed further in subsequent stories. I’ll pause here only to draw attention to the idea, which seems significant.All (known) organisms share certain physiological needs: metabolic needs (air, water, and food in animals; CO2, sunlight, water in plants), security needs, and reproductive needs being the most important. Organisms with any degree of cognitive ability have evolved a positive feedback mechanism: satisfying these needs (and others) produces a sensation of pleasure and/or relief. Whatever else we can say about Virginia and Mother, we can say that pleasure is a motivating factor. Chess is a two-player game which uses a board and 32 pieces in two colours. Each player has a king, a queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns, which are weaker pieces and therefore considered expendable. The object of the game is to capture the opposing player’s king. The game is believed to have been invented in India sometime between 280-550.I don’t think Virginia is claiming that the game was taught to humans by Mother and her kin, but rather that games and contests, as a concept, predate humanity. Chess is being used here to stand in for a category.Chess is a two-player game, and one naturally wonders whether the game Mother is playing similarly has two opposing sides, or more, and whom she is playing against. No answers are forthcoming in this story. Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles which were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for 135 million years (200 to 65 million years ago). Sharks are a group of cartilaginous fish, the earliest of which evolved between 450 and 300 million years ago. The implication seems to me that Mother and/or her kin have been around for at least that long, and that individual animals of those species were also co-opted by her/them for her/their purposes (but proved to be of little “use”).Contemplating deep time can induce wonder and vertigo, and the “time abyss” has long been a staple of genre fiction. It is used to disorienting effect here by presenting an intelligent creature of an unknown type which has been around for 100 times longer than our species has existed. There have been at least five major ice ages over the earth’s history, outside of which the planet was ice-free at all latitudes. The earliest known was 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago, followed by more recent episodes (720 to 635 million years ago, 450 to 420 million years ago, 360 to 260 million years ago), and ending with the one in which we currently find ourselves (since 2.58 million years ago). Within the major ice ages, ice coverage have varied considerably, with severe glacial periods and milder interglacial periods.The sun’s luminosity has increased roughly 30% over its 4.54 billion year history, and will increase by another 68% over the next 4.8 billion years. The difference in luminosity does not account for the major ice ages, however, and it’s unclear what period Mother (through Virginia) could be referring to. Large volcanic and impact events can throw up dust and debris into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of sunlight which passes through it, and lowering the surface temperature. These are referred to as volcanic and impact winter, respectively, and the earth has endured these multiple times, but their duration is short (2 to 3 years). This is undoubtedly a reference to Adolph Hitler. Hitler was the leader of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, and a main player in the events of WWII and the Holocaust. Nuclear winter, the analogue to volcanic/impact winter, which would likely result from a nuclear war, is what I believe is being alluded to. Unfortunately for Mother, the effects on sun luminosity on the surface would be relatively short-lived. Hiroshima, a city on Japan’s Honshu island, was hit with a nuclear bomb dropped by United States Air Force on August 6, 1945. Verdun is a city in northeast France. It was the site of a major battle in WWI. Fought from February to December 1916, it was one of the bloodiest battlefields in history, with casualties estimated at 750 000. A final indignity to further dehumanize Roger and, by extension, humanity. Roger Garland is representative of a certain type of Barron protagonist: male, no longer young, hardboiled, defined by his work, action-oriented, doomed. He remains a man of action to the end. Unfortunately, those actions are largely futile. He’s involved in a game he can’t win, simply because he’s not one of the players. He’s a piece that is no longer useful, and which has been sacrificed.The story can easily be read as vampire tale, especially if divorced from the context provided by the other stories in this collection. Virginia and Mother have characteristics which are traditionally associated with vampirism: feeding on live humans, circular wounds on the victim, mesmerism, shape-changing, and other supernatural abilities. Mother\'s aversion to light and ability to corrupt humans, transforming them into agents which serve her agenda, are supportive of this reading.Virginia herself is clearly an ""Old Hag"" (""mare"" or ""nightmare"") from Germanic and English folklore, an evil spirit that sat on a sleeper\'s chest and sent them terrifying dreams. The condition of sleep paralysis, a terrifying state in which a subject is awake but unable to breathe or move, was associated with the Old Hag. A sufferer was said to be ""hagridden"". Roger’s nightmares begin after his meeting with Virginia. Dr. Riley claims that she rode Dr. Porter and him all night, and we witness her riding Dox and Roger like steeds. While drawing on folklore, the story derives its scares from an attempt to demythify those creatures, providing a naturalistic explanation for their existence, and setting them squarely in the modern world. The monsters are established as physical rather than transcendent beings, existing within history, and interacting in specific and consistent ways. Mother’s influence is limited by geography, scientific devices are used to block or limit it. Significantly, scientists are involved in studying it. This story is the first of several which feature this specific type of alien intelligence, and we will have the opportunity to see how their depiction evolves.Laird has cited Robert A. Heinlein\'s The Puppet Masters (1951)\xa0as an influence. In the novel, small alien creatures (from Saturn\'s moon Titan -- names sure to raise eyebrows in any Barron reader) secretly attempt to invade Earth by attaching themselves to human hosts and taking control of their bodies (while leaving their minds conscious but blissfully uncaring). The human hosts are repeatedly referred to as ""hag-ridden"" throughout the novel. It is hypothesized that the creatures are all fragments of a larger entity. There is the distinct possibility that the strange elements of the story, as related by Roger, are the product of an MK ULTRA experiment. Roger and his men, isolated in the Virginia woods, and under the supervision of two CIA doctors, are the subjects of the experiment, and Virginia herself is either a prop or a delusion. The object of the experiment remains unclear. Without the broader context of Laird’s other stories, this is certainly the most realistic reading of the story.\xa0Old Virginia can also be read as a story about aging. Roger fears he may be over the hill, unable to perform both physically and mentally. Early in the story, he expresses concern about being displaced in his agency (CIA) by a new breed men (Richards), whose methods and goals he finds repulsive.\xa0In addition to the physical deterioration, he worries about his mental faculties. The most horrifying element of the story, in any reading, is alluded to near the end. Roger defiantly tells Virginia that he is a patriot, and that he, at least, would not betray himself or humanity. He quickly realizes that this resolve may not be sufficient.On its heels arrived the notion that perhaps I would change my mind after a conversation with Mother.In an ironic echo, he faces in the end the loss of his agency (volition) to a new breed of man (Virginia).\xa0He sees it coming but lacks the will to prevent this by taking his own life.We\'re left with the sobering thought that we, like Roger, may also one day be reduced to a shell of our former selves. Strokes, dementia, Alzheimer\'s disease, and other conditions will rob some of us of our cognitive faculties, and our volition, in the end. The writing is on the wall. On a final note, it is interesting to consider to what extent we are horrified by the behaviour of Virginia and Mother, who treat humans instrumentally, reducing them to meat, transportation, labour, and entertainment, since this is fundamentally the way that humans behave towards non-human animals. These notes are necessarily incomplete, and may contain mistakes of fact or interpretation. If you have information you would like to add, find mistakes you would like me to correct, or disagree with my interpretation, please comment on the post to let me know.']","After declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1775, before the Declaration of Independence was officially adopted, the Virginia colony became the Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the original thirteen states of the United States, adopting as its official slogan ""The Old Dominion"". The entire modern states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, and portions of Ohio and Western Pennsylvania were later created from the territory encompassed, or claimed by, the colony of Virginia at the time of further American independence in July 1776."
meaning of the song this woman's work,"['Lyrics mean so much to my personal life. This blog is about music that relates to my opinions, love & life. Here’s a cute song about.. well, Love. =P This track simplifies how I feel sometimes. I’m quite a pessimistic person, I have a feeling like there’s always better person, better situation, better life, better experience, better anything. It’s like you try and try, and you give and give and you’ve given up. Yet, sometimes all we need is to be in the comfort of someone who can lift your spirits up. Make you feel worth living, makes you want to live in the now and look forward to the future – and forget the past (the negative ones). We won’t need a time machine if we are content, happy with our present and know that there’s always a better future awaiting in front of us all. I’ve just stumbled into this track while listening to some XFactor Contestants. What a great song. I love the tenderness and the lyrics. Totally reminded me of Kevin Michael. The high pitch tender voice and the big afro. Oh what memories. So this track is supposedly about being a mother to an unborn child and from a guy’s point of view. I got this track literally from Twitter. ViLLE BABY actually dropped me a message (and I’m sure others too) with a link to this and I’ve gotta say, I’m resonating with this track. It’s smooth, great lyrics and clear message delivered. I remember back when I listened to these tracks a lot. It’s been hard to write up these messages because we’re too busy living our lives. We’re better than that, and the problem is – others ain’t the same. How about we do our part to have some changes? Posted in Lyrics, Music Video, Personal Post, Song Comment tagged Mr. Probz, Sapphire, waves at 11:57 am by LynxLee I heard Waves on an Internet radio just a while ago and I can’t stop listening to it. Then I checked out YouTube and Mr. Probz got this video as well. I have to say, this guy has got amazing talent in music. I love it. Can you feel it? Gotta love the care in this track. We sometimes get into that state of mind when we get in love, and everything is beautiful. Then it started to get really.. addictive, really crazy in some way. Jealousy plagues in your mind, Missing that person to the state of dilemma and Unable to think straight. Who says falling in love is easy? It hurts, but probably the easiest way to feel better is to never fall in love again. I believe this is what some of my friends had decided. The excuse was, no one is perfect enough for me. Personally, if you are lovesick – move on. You’ll go through it again eventually. I heard this on the radio and thought I’d share it.', 'Kate Bush Encyclopedia is free to use, but not to operate. Please consider making a small donation to help keep this website online. Song written by Kate Bush. Originally released on the soundtrack of the movie She\'s Having A Baby in 1988. A year later, the song was included in Kate\'s sixth studio album The Sensual World. The lyric is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth. Written for the movie She\'s Having a Baby, director John Hughes used the song during the film\'s dramatic climax, when Jake (Kevin Bacon) learns that the lives of his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and their unborn child are in danger. As the song plays, we see a montage sequence of flashbacks showing the couple in happier times, intercut with shots of him waiting for news of Elizabeth and their baby\'s condition. Bush wrote the song specifically for the sequence, writing from a man\'s (Jake\'s) viewpoint and matching the words to the visuals which had already been filmed. The song was used in the 21st episode of the third season of Party Of Five, the second episode of the series Alias and in the first episode of the second season of The Handmaid\'s Tale. The song was also used in the film A Man Called Otto. \'This Woman\'s Work\' was released as a 7"" single, a 7"" picture disc single, a 12"" single (with poster sleeve), a cassette single and a CD-single. In Germany, a 3"" CD-single was also released. On all formats, the bonus track Be Kind To My Mistakes was included, plus - on all formats except the 7"" singles and the cassette single - I\'m Still Waiting. There are four different versions of \'This Woman\'s Work\'. The original version was released on the soundtrack album of the movie \'She\'s Having A Baby\'. The version of the song that was featured on \'The Sensual World\' was re-edited from the original version. The version released as a single was a third, slightly different mix.Finally, \'This Woman\'s Work\' was completely re-recorded on Kate\'s 2011 album Director\'s Cut. The new version features a sparse performance of Bush playing the piano and singing. The music video was directed by Bush herself. It starts with Bush, spotlighted in an otherwise black room, playing the introductory notes on a piano. In the next scene, a distraught man (played by Tim McInnerny) is pacing in the waiting room of a hospital. It is then revealed through flashbacks that his wife (played by Bush) has collapsed while they were having dinner. The story blurs into a continuous scene where he carries her to the car, a desperate race to the hospital, and his wife being wheeled away on a stretcher as he races in behind her. While waiting, the husband is wracked with fear and imagines his wife in happier times, kissing him in the rain, and even imagines the nurse coming to tell him she has died. The nurse then pulls him out of his reverie, as she reassuringly puts her hand on his shoulder and tells him about his wife\'s situation, the outcome of this is left ambiguous; yet the nurse is seen smiling as she speaks, implying a happy outcome. The final scene of the video returns to Bush as silently closes the piano keyboard. \'This Woman\'s Work\' was covered by Aco, Baby Bushka, Beloved, Bonnie Bailey, Dark Dark Dark, Kat Devlin, E-Clypse featuring Emma Price, Jess Gillam, Goodknight Productions, Göteborgs Symfoniker, Glennis Grace, Hope for Isla & Jude,\xa0 The Kate Bush Experience, Lady Maisery, Greg Laswell, Maxwell, Hope Murphy, Octover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Quaker Notes, Lindsay Schief, Titlucio, Tk The Prophet,\xa0 TM Collective, Reginald Van Carreker and Rachel Z. John Hughes, the American film director, had just made this film called \'She\'s Having A Baby\', and he had a scene in the film that he wanted a song to go with. And the film\'s very light: it\'s a lovely comedy. His films are very human, and it\'s just about this young guy - falls in love with a girl, marries her. He\'s still very much a kid. She gets pregnant, and it\'s all still very light and child-like until she\'s just about to have the baby and the nurse comes up to him and says it\'s a in a breech position and they don\'t know what the situation will be. So, while she\'s in the operating room, he has so sit and wait in the waiting room and it\'s a very powerful piece of film where he\'s just sitting, thinking; and this is actually the moment in the film where he has to grow up. He has no choice. There he is, he\'s not a kid any more; you can see he\'s in a very grown-up situation. And he starts, in his head, going back to the times they were together. There are clips of film of them laughing together and doing up their flat and all this kind of thing. And it was such a powerful visual: it\'s one of the quickest songs I\'ve ever written. It was so easy to write. We had the piece of footage on video, so we plugged it up so that I could actually watch the monitor while I was sitting at the piano and I just wrote the song to these visuals. It was almost a matter of telling the story, and it was a lovely thing to do: I really enjoyed doing it. (Roger Scott Interview, BBC Radio 1 (UK), 14 October 1989) That\'s the sequence I had to write the song about, and it\'s really very moving, him in the waiting room, having flashbacks of his wife and him going for walks, decorating... It\'s exploring his sadness and guilt: suddenly it\'s the point where he has to grow up. He\'d been such a wally up to this point. (Len Brown, \'In The Realm Of The Senses\'. NME (UK), 7 October 1989) There\'s a film called \'She\'s Having A Baby\'. And John Hughes, the director, rung up and said that he had a sequence in the film that he really wanted a song written to be with. And I\'d only worked the once before on the \'Castaway\' film - where I\'d really enjoyed that - so I was extremely tempted by the offer. And when he sent the piece of film that the song was going to be part of, I just thought it was wonderful, it was so moving, a very moving piece of film. And in a way, there was a sense that the whole film built up to this moment. And it was a very easy song to write. It was very quick. And just kind of came, like a lot of songs do. Even if you struggle for months, in the end, they just kind of go - BLAH! - You know. [Laughs]. So that was the first song that I wrote for \'The Sensual World\' album. In fact at the time we weren\'t even sure whether to put it on the album or not. And I must say that Del was very instrumental in saying that I should put it on the album, and I\'m very glad I did. Because I had the most fantastic response - in some ways, maybe the greatest response - to this song. And I was really - I was absolutely thrilled, that you felt that way about it. (Kate Bush Con, 1990) (I know you have a little life in you yetI know you have a lot of strength left.I know you have a little life in you yet.I know you have a lot of strength left.)']","The lyric of ""This Woman's Work"" is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth. Written for the movie She's Having a Baby, director John Hughes used the song during the film's dramatic climax, when Jake (Kevin Bacon) learns that the lives of his wife, Kristy (Elizabeth McGovern), and their unborn child are in danger. As the song plays, we see a montage sequence of flashbacks showing the couple in happier times, intercut with shots of him waiting for news of Kristy and their baby's condition. Bush wrote the song specifically for the sequence, writing from a man's (Jake's) viewpoint and matching the words to the visuals which had already been filmed."

These diseases present significant threats to health around the world. But they aren't the only major killers. In fact, they're not even the leading killers anymore!  Today, cancer claims more lives globally than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined, and the death toll from cancer is only going to grow. Cancer is a major burden of disease worldwide. Each year, tens of millions of people are diagnosed with cancer around the world, and more than half of the patients eventually die from it. In many countries, cancer ranks the second most common cause of death following cardiovascular diseases. Enlargement of the uterus or ovaries is a frequent reason for referral of breast cancer patients to the Gynecologic Oncology Center. In many cases, the enlargement is detected on an abdominal-pelvic computed tomography scan obtained for staging or follow-up purposes. If leiomyoma causes enlargement of the uterus or excessive bleeding, a total hysterectomy may be required for therapeutic or, occasionally, for diagnostic purposes. Ovarian  cysts  can  be  classified  as  either  nonneoplastic  or  neoplastic. Nonneoplastic  ovarian  cysts  include  physiologic  cysts,\xa0 such  as  corpus luteum  and  endometriotic  cysts.\xa0 The  most  common  neoplastic  ovarian cysts are cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst), which is usually found in younger patients, and serous or mucinous cystadenoma, which occurs in patients of all ages. In women of reproductive age, the ovaries may enlarge slightly in parallel with physiologic effects of pituitary ovarian stimulation. Physiologic ovarian cysts are simple cysts, usually unilocular on sonography. Physiologic cysts may regress by the next menstrual cycle but sometimes persist for two or more cycles. Of note, data from the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (Chalas et al., 2005) showed that there was an increased incidence of benign ovarian cysts in women taking tamoxifen (relative risk, 1.5). If an ovarian cyst is more than 5 cm in diameter or if there is any palpable enlargement after menopause, the possibility of a neoplastic event should be considered. The  initial  evaluation  should  include  a  thorough  history  that  specifically addresses menstrual history, sexual history, family history, tamoxifen usage,\xa0 neurologic  history,\xa0 and  associated  symptoms.\xa0 This  is  followed  by a comprehensive physical examination, with the pelvic examination being the primary focus. The goal is to look for evidence of a pelvic mass and to determine the consistency (solid or cystic), mobility (mobile or fixed), and size of any such mass. Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or pain that radiates to the upper thigh, with or without a history of endometriosis, may suggest a diagnosis of endometriosis. Pain associated with an enlarged ovary is usually related to a benign process except in the case of a rapidly growing or necrotic neoplasm of the ovary, such as a sarcoma or granulosa cell tumor. Vaginal sonography can provide useful information about the size and complexity of an ovarian mass (Figure 15-4). Multiloculation, excrescences, and increased Doppler flow (low impedance) should increase the suspicion of a neoplasm. Figure 15-4.\xa0 Ovarian mass identified on vaginal sonography. Even in the case of ovarian cysts less than 5 cm in diameter, sonography  may  be  helpful  in  determining  whether  the  cyst  is  simple, unilocular, or multilocular. An elevated serum CA-125 value may suggest underlying pathology, although  the  CA-125  value  is  normal  in  up  to  50%\xa0 of  patients  with early-stage ovarian cancers. Moreover, even though CA-125 is used as a marker for epithelial ovarian cancer, levels of this marker may also be significantly elevated in patients who have uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, endometriosis, or any type of inflammation of the pleura or peritoneum; in patients with cirrhosis of the liver; and in 5-7% of women with no abnormalities.\xa0 If  the  CA-125  value  is  elevated  and  the  likelihood  of  a  malignancy as indicated by other factors is low, the patient can be observed and the CA-125 value measured again two weeks later. Ovarian cysts less than 5 cm in diameter that do not appear to be multiloculated on sonography can be managed conservatively. Conservative management should include serial clinical examinations and repeat vaginal  sonography,\xa0 which  is  generally  performed  approximately  8  weeks after initial sonography. Complex  ovarian  cysts,\xa0 ovarian  cysts  larger  than  5 cm  in  diameter and  ovarian  cysts  that  increase  in  size  usually  require  surgical  exploration, primarily to rule out a neoplastic cause. In patients who have had breast reconstruction with a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, appropriate surgical intervention may be carried out using a laparoscopic  approach  or  midline  abdominal  laparotomy  approach.\xa0 It  should be emphasized that these are general guidelines and do not replace good clinical judgment in the individual patient. It is important to recognize that the ovaries and other genital-tract organs can be the site of metastases from breast cancer. If one or both ovaries are replaced by solid masses, especially when radiologic findings indicate metastases  in  the  abdomen  or  elsewhere,\xa0 percutaneous  needle  biopsy  of  the ovaries under computed tomographic guidance provides rapid and useful information without the need for surgical intervention. If ovarian metastases from breast cancer cause symptoms (pain, bladder pressure, or constipation) or contribute to obstruction of the small or large bowel, abdominal surgery may be necessary to correct the problem. If the patient is asymptomatic  and  ovarian  metastases  from  breast  cancer  are  confirmed,\xa0 tumor-reductive surgery is not generally favored over additional systemic therapy unless it can be demonstrated with high certainty that the cancer is localized to pelvic organs and that hysterectomy or oophorectomy alone will remove most of the metastatic disease. If the patient is experiencing pain secondary to the ovarian metastasis or if radiation therapy or chemotherapy is not an option for the patient, palliative surgery can be considered.

Engitech is a values-driven technology agency dedicated. engitech@oceanthemes.net The ovaries happen to be part of the female reproductive system. They happen to be located in the lower abdomen on both sides of one’s uterus. Women have two ovaries that do produce eggs as well as the hormones estrogen as well as progesterone. Sometimes, a fluid-filled sac known a cyst will also develop on one of the ovaries. Many women will also develop at least one cyst during their lifetime. In most cases, cysts are painless and also cause no symptoms. There are also various types of ovarian cysts, like dermoid cysts and endometrioma cysts. However, functional cysts happen to the most common type. The two types of functional cysts do include follicle and corpus luteum cysts. During a menstrual cycle of a woman, an egg does indeed grow in a sac known a follicle. This sac is also located inside one’s ovaries. In most cases, this follicle or sac does also break open and also releases an egg. But if the follicle does not break open, the fluid inside the follicle can also form a cyst on one’s ovary. Follicle sacs typically do dissolve after releasing an egg. But if the sac does not get dissolved and the opening of the follicle seals, additional fluid can indeed also develop inside the sac and this accumulation of fluid does cause a corpus luteum cyst. Often times, ovarian cysts do not cause any symptoms. However, symptoms can also appear as the cyst grows. Symptoms may include: These symptoms can also indicate a ruptured cyst or an ovarian torsion. Both complications can have serious consequences if not treated early. Most ovarian cysts are benign and naturally do go away on their own without treatment. These cysts cause little if any, symptoms. But in rare cases, one’s doctor may also detect a cancerous cystic ovarian mass during a routine examination. Ovarian torsion is also another rare complication of ovarian cysts. This is when a large cyst causes an ovary to twist or move from its original position. Blood supply to the ovary is also cut off, and if not treated, it can cause damage or death to the ovarian tissue. Although uncommon, ovarian torsion does account for nearly 3 percent of emergency gynecologic surgeries. Ruptured cysts, which are also rare, can rather cause intense pain and internal bleeding. This complication does also increase the risk of an infection and can be life-threatening if left untreated. One’s doctor can rather detect an ovarian cyst treatment in Hyderabad during a routine pelvic examination. They may also notice swelling on one of one’s ovaries and order an ultrasound test to confirm the presence of a cyst. An ultrasound test (ultrasonically) happens to be an imaging test that does make use of high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of one’s internal organs. Ultrasound tests to help determine the size, location, shape, and composition (solid or fluid-filled) of a cyst. Because the majority of cysts disappear after a few weeks or months, one’s doctor may not immediately recommend a treatment plan. Instead, they may also repeat the ultrasound test in a few weeks or months to check one’s condition. If no changes occur in one’s condition or if the cyst does increase in size, one has to request additional tests to determine other causes of one’s symptoms. One’s doctor may also recommend treatment to shrink or remove the cyst if it does not go away on its own or if it grows larger. If one has recurrent ovarian cysts, one’s doctor can prescribe oral contraceptives to stop ovulation and also prevent the development of new cysts. Oral contraceptives can also reduce one’s risk of ovarian cancer. The risk of ovarian cancer is higher in postmenopausal women. If one cyst is small and results from an imaging test to rule out cancer, one’s doctor can indeed perform a laparoscopy treatment in Hyderabad to surgically remove the cyst. The procedure does involve one’s doctor making a tiny incision near one’s navel and then inserting a small instrument into one’s abdomen to remove the cyst. If one has a large cyst, one’s doctor can surgically remove the cyst through a large incision in one’s abdomen. They will conduct an immediate biopsy, and if they do determine that the cyst is cancerous, they may perform a hysterectomy to remove one’s ovaries as well as the uterus. Ovarian cysts cannot be prevented. However, routine gynecologic examinations can also detect ovarian cysts early. Benign ovarian cysts do not become cancerous. However, symptoms of ovarian cancer can actually mimic symptoms of an ovarian cyst. Thus, it’s important to visit one’s doctor and receive a correct diagnosis. Alert one’s doctor to symptoms that may indicate a problem, such as: The outlook for premenopausal women with ovarian cysts is good. Most cysts do disappear within a few months. However, recurrent ovarian cysts can also occur in premenopausal women and women with hormone imbalances. If left untreated, some cysts can also decrease fertility. This is common with endometriomas and polycystic ovary syndrome. To improve fertility, one’s doctor can remove or shrink the cyst. Functional cysts, cystadenomas, and dermoid cysts do not affect fertility. Although some doctors take a “wait and see” approach with ovarian cysts, one’s doctor may recommend surgery to remove and examine any cyst or growth that does develop on the ovaries after menopause. This is because the risk of developing a cancerous cyst or ovarian cancer does increase after menopause. However, ovarian cysts do not increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Some doctors will remove a cyst if it is larger than 5 centimeters in diameter. Some ovarian cysts are indeed associated with decreased fertility while others are not. Endometriomas and cysts from polycystic ovarian syndrome may also decrease a woman’s ability to get pregnant. However, functional cysts, dermoid cysts, and cystadenomas are not associated with difficulty in getting pregnant unless they are large. If one’s physician discovers an ovarian cyst while one is pregnant, the treatment may also depend on the type or size of the cyst. Most cysts are benign and do not require surgical intervention. However, one may need surgery if the cyst is suspicious for cancer or if the cyst ruptures or twists (known as torsion), or is too large. Your email address will not be published.

Other types include cysts due to endometriosis, dermoid cysts, and cystadenomas. Many small cysts occur in both ovaries in polycystic ovarian syndrome.

The rhyme has been associated with the Great Plague which happened in England in 1665. \xa0A rosy rash was a symptom of the plague, and posies of herbs were carried as protection and to ward off the smell of the disease. Sneezing or coughing was a final fatal symptom, and ""all fall down"" was exactly what happened. \xa0The line Ashes, Ashes in colonial versions of the rhyme is claimed to refer to cremation of the bodies. \xa0Yeah! Fun. Every kid needs a swing set. \xa0It\'s like a roller coaster on a budget. \xa0Even old people end up with a porch swing or a rocking chair. \xa0there\'s just something fun about swinging. Slide! There\'s something fun about letting go and sliding down a slide. \xa0However, back when it was cool we didn\'t have the nice safe plastic slides... no. \xa0we had these metal, jagged, 150 degree bright metal death slides. \xa0you not only had the thrill of sliding but also the challenge of surviving with all your fingers and toes and without 3rd degree burns. that\'s more like it... hope you\'ve got your aleo vera ready. Yes, back #WhenItWasCool survival was a part of play time. \xa0Don\'t even get me started about ""Hey, let\'s play war. \xa0I got some firecrackers."" because there\'s a reason why you\'re told ""Don\'t try this at home."" \xa0Somehow I managed to make it to adulthood with both eyes intact. But hey, have some adventure! \xa0Have some imagination. \xa0Put down the PlayStation controller for a bit and you and a friend grab a stick and go explore something. \xa0It\'s Sunday- Funday!

His extended family decided to take a trip to Whidbey Island to see the Christmas decorations and do their Christmas shopping. \xa0Having arrived on a tour boat from Seattle, the time ashore is not long, five and a half hours, but is still tiring for him. Not being fleet of foot, he has chosen this resting place where he is comfortable sitting on the bench with the boy and his dog in bronze for company.\xa0 He can look over Saratoga Passage to view Mount Baker and Camano Island.\xa0 If it were the springtime of the year, he might also add a grey whale and her young calf to this vista but, alas it is winter.\xa0 Because of the boat ride here, he bundled up when he dressed for this foray, his wife having insisted that he wear that heavy red sweater with the snowflakes all over it.\xa0 “It is Christmassy,” she had reminded him. He is toasty warm and happy to doze on this bench until his family returns. His wife, daughter and three granddaughters have agreed to meet him here before having lunch. Their chatter, running, jumping and hanging on grandpa has worn him down and he will have just a little rest here on the bench.\xa0 There are many folks milling about both from the tour boat and those who have traveled here by car, taking the ferry from the mainland.\xa0 Every year in Langley, the merchants dress the town for Christmas and this is the reason that his family has planned today’s event.\xa0 Lots of shops to see, great places to eat and….a place for grandpa to sit and enjoy the winter sun. Many fine artists live here on the island and every year there is a competition to see who can do the grandest display decorating the merchants’ doorways.\xa0 It is a stiff competition and the displays range from wacky and outrageous to absolutely gorgeous. Prizes are given to the winners.\xa0 This is part of the draw to come to Langley for Christmas shopping. While grandpa is dozing in the sun, a flock of little girls race into the Boy and the Dog Park where he is sitting.\xa0 They chatter like birds and awaken the old man.\xa0 He smiles at them, giving them reassurances that he is benign.\xa0 Suddenly one little girl jumps up on the bench and stands next to him. She chatters away at him in her high little girl voice.\xa0 He continues to smile and then nods his head.\xa0 She races off and talks with her companions.\xa0 “He nodded Yes!” she said excitedly.\xa0 Soon there is a line of little girls, all dressed in their Christmas sweaters, red coats, red hats, fleece boots and smiles.\xa0 They are lined up by the bench where the old man sits.\xa0 One by one they get up on the bench and whisper in his ear.\xa0 Mostly he cannot tell what they are saying because he has taken his hearing aids out and stuffed them in his jacket pocket.\xa0 And besides, little girl whispers are really hard to understand, but he smiles and nods his head. Soon they have all talked into his ear and they are all smiles and twirling pigtails and happiness.\xa0 He is happy too.\xa0 Their mothers are approaching from a nearby shop where one mother has stood vigilant outside the door to be sure the girls were safe.\xa0 The girls gather around their mothers and are all trying to relate their experiences all at once with lots of shrieks and squeals about talking with the old man. He sits contentedly on his bench enjoying their laughter and joy.\xa0 Soon his own granddaughters will be there to take him to lunch.\xa0 Hummmm….he IS getting hungry. The little flock of girls flies off up the street while calling to the old man. . .”GOOD BYE SANTA!” Once a year I hang my show at the Braeburn Restaurant in Langley, Washington.\xa0 Today is the day.\xa0 I will be hanging it after hours, so tomorrow will be the first day that you will have the opportunity to see it. In the past I have featured, trucks, barns, old gas stations, larger-than-life food items (peanut butter sandwiches 18 tall), crows and this year the feature is birds. When my show was taken down last year, I started thinking about what I would show for 2018.\xa0 I decided to do local birds.\xa0 These paintings are in watercolor, not my usual medium, which is oil.\xa0 The really unusual thing about the paintings is they are not painted on paper, but on treated panels of medium density fibreboard (MDF). Another unusual thing about them is that they are loosely painted, not the usual photorealism of my oil paintings. This makes them more spontaneous and whimsical than my usual works. There are twenty-five birds, a few dogs, and, yes, some trucks!\xa0 I would hope that you could visit the show sometime between July 14 and August 31. You may purchase any of the paintings and take them with you, which is nice if you are from out of town. The Braeburn Restaurant is located at 197 D. 2nd St. Langley, WA 98260. They serve breakfast and lunch. Their phone number is 360-321-3211. https://braeburnlangley.com/ Just came in from feeding the animals.\xa0 It is cold again this morning.\xa0 It was colder yesterday morning at 22 degrees, which for Western Washington, is cold.\xa0 Since we have rather high humidity, the cold is more penetrating.\xa0 For those who live in the mid-west, they probably would consider these temps a heat wave. Ha! Everything is frozen outside, so the first thing I had to do when getting suited up to meet the weather challenges was to fill a large bucket with very hot water.\xa0 The doves, the baby chicks and the molting old hens all need to have their waterers unfrozen.\xa0 I also filled the birdbaths with warm water as the poor wild birds have no place to drink. We have one baby dove who is just now fending for himself and I was worried that he might not make it through this cold.\xa0 This morning he is huddled in a corner trying to keep warm as his mother has now abandoned him since he can feed himself.\xa0 He was fine and jumped right in when the feed was provided. The ten chicks, which are now two months old, are very hardy, but today I gave them their first cracked corn, which helps warm the chickens from the inside out.\xa0 The also got fresh bread, which they chased all over their pen.\xa0 The cold doesn’t seem to faze them. The old hens, however, felt the cold.\xa0 Why do they choose to molt just when the weather turns cold.\xa0 Molting, as I have mentioned in earlier pieces, is the process of losing all their feathers and growing a new set, which means they are not laying any eggs.\xa0 So we are between eggs with old ones molting and new ones too young yet.\xa0 I hate buying store eggs. The plantings in the yard look sad, especially the rhododendrons that lower their leaves as though dead or dying.\xa0 This is the way they look in the heat of summer when they are in dire need of water.\xa0 I always hate the look of them in this cold. I know when things thaw that there will be lots of mud because the frost has pushed up around the stones in all the pathways making crunching noises as I walk out to do the chores. The advantage to all the trouble above is THE SUN IS SHINING. It is a trade off.\xa0 If we have sunshine, we have cold weather.\xa0 If it is in the 40s then it will rain and be grey.\xa0 Yesterday and this morning, we can bask in its warmth and enjoy the vitamins it gives to us, though begrudgingly in winter.\xa0 Makes me feel perkier already.\xa0 Amazing what a little sunshine can do for your mental health. Guess I will go for a walk and enjoy it.\xa0 Never know how long it will last. A couple of nights ago, I got up during the night (1 a.m.) to address the call of nature (an old lady thing) and thought that we had left a light on outside. Or maybe my husband’s truck had the interior light on inside the cab. I peeked out the window and the moon was shining as bright as day. I remember when I was small we had a clear, bright red phonograph record of children’s songs and this one was on it. Whenever I see the moon so bright, I sing this in my head. Does anyone else remember this song? The following is from Wikipedia. Girls and Boys Come Out to Play’ or ‘Boys and Girls Come Out to Play’ is a nursery rhyme that has existed since at least 1708. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 5452. And come with your playfellows into the street. Come with a good will or not at all. A halfpenny roll will serve us all. And we’ll have a pudding in half an hour.[1] Other versions often put boys before girls in the opening line.[2] The verse may date back to the time when children were expected to work during the daylight hours, and play was reserved for late in the evening. The first two lines at least appeared in dance books (1708, 1719, 1728), satires (1709, 1725), and a political broadside (1711). It appeared in the earliest extant collection of nursery rhymes, Tommy Thumb’s Pretty Song Book published in London around 1744. The 1744 version included the first six lines. Well, I guess the moonlight always makes me want to go out and dance in it. However, it was the middle of the night and the temperature was about 35F. I declined and tottered off to the WC. We have had several consecutive nights of bright moonlight. I usually use the lightness of the bedroom windows to tell me if it is about time to get up. The moonlight confuses that. Midnight moonlight and the gloaming of 6:30 a.m. look about the same these days. I went back to bed and went to sleep. Occasionally when I am driving home at night through the area where I live, which has very straight roads, if the moon is shining bright as day, I turn off my headlights and go home by moonlight. So far I haven’t alarmed anyone coming from the opposite direction. Can you imagine me turning on my headlights when they didn’t know anyone was there? This full moon is particularly interesting as it is the Lantern of the Lunar New Year. The fifteenth day of the New Year. New Year ’s Day is always the dark of the moon. Then as the moon grows in size various celebrations happen over a two week period. Example: New Year’s Eve, eat jiaozi (dumpling with pork and green onion) and visit with family. Days one through five you should not take anything from your house, even corpses. It is bad luck and you will lose your wealth. We went traveling in Hunan Provence on the fifth day and I commented to my Chinese student “Look at all the funeral processions. Was there a major disaster or accident?” He replied that it was the fifth day. The people who had died after the New Year could now be buried. There was also a slightly larger number of deaths after the new year as people try to stay alive just one more year and succumb shortly after. Second day, married women visit their parents. This is something that doesn’t always happen as the husband’s parents take precedence once you are married. The seventh day is considered the birthday of all the common class people. They will all celebrate this day. Important figures have birthdays on their day of birth. On the thirteenth day some families fast or eat reduced amounts of vegetarian foods because they have been feasting for twelve days. Day fourteen is a preparation day for the Lantern Festival when new lanterns will appear fresh, and red in front of shops and houses. Lantern day is celebrated by gifts of oranges. When we lived there, small mandarin orange trees covered with oranges on their branches and about three to four feet tall were given as gifts to family. Sweet rice balls are eaten to commemorate the full moon. Tāngyuán, a soup of round balls is also served. The “ruler of heaven’s” birthday is supposed to be on the fifteenth day. He is responsible for good luck, good fortune and wealth. So dancing in the moonlight is probably a good thing. Even though I want to do it now, I will probably wait until we are sleeping outside this summer when dancing in my nightgown won’t pose issues of hypothermia. Happy New Year.', 'Singing games began to be recorded and studied seriously in the nineteenth century as part of the wider folklore movement. Joseph Strutt’s Sports and Pastimes of the People of England (1801), Robert Chambers Popular Rhymes of Scotland (1826), James Orchard Halliwell’s The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and his Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales (1849), G. F. Northal’s English Folk Rhymes (1892), all included collected singing games. However, the first studies to focus solely on this area were William Wells Newell’s Games and Songs of American Children (1883) and Alice Gomme’s The Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1894-8), both considered landmark works in the serious study of the subject on respective sides of the Atlantic. Naturally, these works tended to have many of the faults associated with the folklore and folk song collecting of their eras, and have been criticised for a focus on rural society at the expense of the urban, and an obsession with recovering what were seen as disappearing ‘authentic’ and original verse, from adults, while disregarding contemporary practice by children. Some of these problems were rectified by a work like that of Norman Douglas, who produced London Street Games in 1916, focusing on the urban working classes. Perhaps still the most significant work in the field was that of Iona and Peter Opie, which departed from previous practice in Britain; following work by Dorothy Howard in America and Brian Sutton-Smith in New Zealand, they relied on detailed observation of children for their evidence resulting in their work on The Language and Lore of Schoolchildren (1959), Children’s Games in Street and Playground (1969) and The Singing Game (1985). Their extensive studies refuted the idea that the traditions of singing games were disappearing in the face of social and media change. Herbert and Mary Knapp, produced One Potato, Two Potato: the Secret Education of American Children (1976). Wider based studies include Helen Schwartzman’s Transformations: The Anthropology of Children’s Play (1978). As the emphasis of investigations changed so did the methods of recording. Early folklorists like Lady Gomme, tended to provide written descriptions of games, lyrics and occasionally musical notation of tunes. By the late 1970s there was increasing use of film to record the actual practice of games, providing a record of the relationship between movement and music. “Girls and Boys Come Out to Play” or “Boys and Girls Come Out to Play” is a nursery rhyme that has existed since at least 1708. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 5452. (The Roud Folk Song Index is a database of nearly 200,000 references to nearly 25,000 songs that have been collected from oral tradition in the English language from all over the world. It is compiled by Steve Roud, a former librarian in the London Borough of Croydon). Other versions often put boys before girls in the opening line. “Skip to My Lou” is a popular children’s song. Skip to My (The) Lou was a popular partner-stealing dance from America’s frontier period. In early America, ‘respectable folks’ in strict Protestant communities regarded the fiddle as one of the devil’s tools (if it led to dancing, which was regarded as sinful). Faced with such a religious obstacle to socializing, young people developed the “play-party,” in which all the objectionable features of dancing were removed or masked so that grave elders would overlook their activity. The dancers sang and the audience clapped to create rhythm for their own music. In time, the play-party acquired a life of its own. It became an ideal amusement for teenagers and young married couples. In many a frontier community, the bear hunters, Indian fighters, the rough keelboat men and the wild cowboys could be seen dancing innocently with their gals, like so many children at a Sunday school picnic. As people moved westward and communities shrugged off the ‘witch-hunt’ mentality which plagued early Protestant New England, square dancing and barn dancing became acceptable, at least to some. “Skip to My Lou” is a simple game of stealing partners (or swapping partners as in square dancing). It begins with any number of couples hand in hand, skipping around in a ring. A lone boy in the center of the moving circle of couples sings, “Lost my partner what’ll I do?” as the girls whirl past him. The young man in the center hesitates while he decides which girl to choose, singing, “I’ll get another one prettier than you.” When he grasps the hand of his chosen one, her partner then takes his place in the center of the ring and the game continues. It’s an ice-breaker, a good dance to get a group acquainted with one another and to get everyone in the mood for swinging around. The “loo” in the title is the Scottish word for “love.” The spelling change from “loo” to “lou” probably happened as Anglo-Americans, and the song, became Americanized.

where does us highway 27 start and end,"['There is an average of one death every daylight hour as a result of large truck crashes. Did you know that every 16 minutes a person is killed or injured in a truck accident? Did you know that big rig truck accidents continue to increase? Even with these frightening scenarios and statistics, powerful trucking industry lobbyists continue to call for the weakening of truck safety rules and regulations to reap a higher profit. Trucking revenues totaled $615 billion last year and revenues are forecasted to nearly double by 2015. While commercial trucking growth is good news for the trucking companies and the nation’s economy, it is bad news for the cars, vans and SUVs that share the road with these potentially lethal giants. In tractor trailer accidents, 98% of fatalities occur to the individuals in the passenger vehicles. Tractor accidents are so common as tractors carrying heavy machinery such as Power Harrows are very slow on the road, and many people are not cautious when attempting to overtake them. Due to the power and size of the tractors, the smaller vehicle usually comes off worse for wear. From 1992 to 2002, the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes has increased by up to 10% due to driver fatigue, unsafe vehicle operation, large, unstable loads or defective equipment. Accidents involving semi-truck, 18-wheeler, and large trucks present many unique issues including driver fatigue, intoxication, driver error, equipment failure, and failure to maintain current inspection standards. According to this Texas truck accident lawyer 1 out of every 8 people killed in a traffic accident in the United States is killed in an accident involving a tractor trailer / semi truck. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) releases data about truck accidents, which is then published by many organizations as truck accident statistics. Every year, 500,000 large trucks, or “semis,” are involved in accidents on our roads. Of these, 5,000 involve fatalities and over 94,000 crashes resulting in injury. In crashes between passenger vehicles and large semi truck, the ration of occupant fatalities is about 21 to 1. A truck accident involving a big truck and a smaller vehicle or pedestrians, often has very tragic consequences. A big truck can weigh more than 80,000 pounds and can go up to 75 feet in length. Considering these numbers, it is not shocking that truck accidents result in more grievous injuries and larger number of deaths than other traffic accidents. What is shocking though are the alarming truck accident statistics. Truck accidents are a very real fact all around the world, with more and more people getting injured or dying in truck accidents everyday. In the United States itself, commercial truck accidents account for quite a significant percentage of all traffic accidents. This is why, following an accident, you should consider seeking out legal assistance; those looking for good Truck Accident Lawyers in Winchester may want to reach out to the Kendall Law Firm. Besides, getting legal aid, you can also take help of technology to tackle a mishap. In critical situations, like an accident, event driven architecture comes handy. How? Take for example, you are driving on a highway. Suddenly, your GPS system alerts that it is re-routing. It does so because something happened, an event occurred. In this case, the event was a traffic accident ahead of you on the road you are driving on. The result of that event has already started becoming backed-up heavy traffic that will delay you if you remain on this road. Instead, your GPS recommends that you switch to a parallel route. It even chooses that route for you and directs you as to how to get there. You made no request to be shown traffic patterns on the various area highways. In fact, you made no requests at all! All the systems involved, including you, your GPS, the guidance system, and the traffic monitoring system are very loosely connected to each other. However, they all quickly got together when the event was detected, and in so doing could reroute the vehicle through notifications sent to you. This, in essence, is Event Driven Architecture (EDA) in action, and also one of its greatest benefits! To better understand the concept and therefore the companies (Vantiq being one of them) that offer the gamut of technologies under EDA, it is always a good idea to visit their website(s). In 2001, there were 6,536 total crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks in Pennsylvania ;154 were fatal. In 2003, there were 58,512 total vehicle accidents involved in fatal crashes in the U.S. Large trucks are more likely to be involved in a fatal multi-vehicle crash than are passenger vehicles. In 2003, Texas witnessed 5040 fatal traffic accidents, of which 438 were fatal truck accidents. This number has risen from 5039 total traffic accidents and 401 fatal truck accidents for the previous year 2002. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, there were 2233 fatal traffic accidents in 2003, of which 213 were fatal truck accidents, as opposed to corresponding numbers of 2198 and 174 for the year 2002. Florida had 4432 fatal traffic accidents in 2003, with 343 of them involving trucks, which was higher than 4431 total traffic accidents for 2002 but lower than the 351 fatal truck accidents in the same period. The highest number of fatal traffic accidents happened in California, with the number being a staggering 5725 fatal auto accidents in 2003. But at 332, the number of fatal truck accidents was not the highest among all states in the US. Trucking revenues totaled $610 billion last year and revenues are forecasted to nearly double by 2015. The majority of fatal truck accidents occur in rural areas (68 percent) during the daytime (66 percent) and on weekdays (78 percent). In 2002, the majority of large truck crashes occurred in good weather (71 percent), on dry roads (71 percent), during the daytime (75 percent), and on weekdays (88 percent). About 27 percent of all large truck drivers involved in fatal truck accidents throughout the United States had at least one prior speeding conviction compared to 19 percent of the passenger vehicle drivers involved in fatal crashes. From 1992 to 2002, the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes has increased by up to 10% due to driver fatigue, unsafe vehicle operation, large, unstable loads or defective equipment. Defects contribute to the number of large truck accidents each year. Some of these defects include: About 700 heavy truck drivers and passengers in truck cabs die each year. In addition, almost 3,700 persons in cars and other passenger vehicles die annually in collisions with heavy trucks. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that in crashes involving large trucks and other vehicles, 98% of the fatalities occur to the people in passenger vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has warned groups using 15-seat passenger vans about the dangers of fully loading the vans and then putting an inexperienced driver behind the wheel. The NHTSA also stated that 15-passenger vans are large trucks and should only be driven by people with experience driving large trucks. The FMCSA’s Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) classifies a truck as large if its gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) exceeds 10,000 pounds. The majority of fatal crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks include trucks that are pulling one trailer. A recent survey showed that 64% of fatal truck crashes had one trailer.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.', '', 'U.S. Route 65 US 65 enters the southeast corner of Arkansas just north of Gassoway, Louisiana.  It is designated as part of Arkansas\' Great River Road from this point north through Lake Village, McGehee, and Dumas.  The Great River Road continues east onto US 165, while US 65 continues northwest to Pine Bluff. US 65 was later relocated to a bypass corridor on the north side of Pine Bluff, dubbed the Downtown Expressway.  With the completion of the Interstate 530 bypass on the south side of Pine Bluff, US 65 was rerouted along Interstate 530, and the Downtown Expressway was resigned US 65 Business. The original US 65 between Pine Bluff and Conway is now signed Arkansas Highway 365. US 65 originally entered Little Rock via what was then Confederate Boulevard (now Springer Boulevard), turning west onto Roosevelt Road, then routing northbound traffic onto Scott Street (with southbound traffic using Main Street one block to the west), and crossing the Arkansas River concurrently with US 67, US 167, and US 70 along the Main Street Bridge to Main Street in North Little Rock.  The highway in Little Rock was eventually relocated five blocks west of Main Street to Broadway, where it crossed the Arkansas River via the Broadway Bridge.  It was finally relocated east along Interstate 30. US 65 originally entered North Little Rock via the Main Street Bridge and continued with northbound traffic along Main Street (with southbound traffic using Maple Street one block to the west), converging onto Main Street, and diverging from US 67 and US 70 by turning west onto 18th Street.  The highway then turned northwest along the east side of the railroad, along what is now Percy Machin Drive, and paralleled the railroad into Conway.  US 65 was later relocated west, following the Broadway Bridge to a west turn on Broadway, proceeding under a rail overpass to then turn north on Pike Avenue.  As US 65 progressed into North Little Rock\'s Levy neighborhood, its alignment shifted east of the railroad along Pike Avenue, turning northwest along Parkway Drive to converge with its original route near the city\'s Amboy neighborhood.  Later, the Levy-to-Amboy segment was relocated again along the west side of the railroad via MacArthur Drive, eventually converging with its original route.  US 65 was finally relocated east, through downtown along Interstate 30, then following Interstate 40 to Conway. US 65 originally entered Conway via Harkrider Street, along what is now signed as Arkansas Highway 365, where it briefly joined with US 64 (Oak Street), running north through downtown.  The highway was eventually relocated along Interstate 40, where it joins its original route on the north side of town via the city\'s Skyline Drive. US 65 continues north through Greenbrier, Clinton, and Marshall before crossing the Buffalo River near Tyler Bend.  South of Harrison, the highway joins briefly with US 62/412 heading northwest through Harrison before diverging from US 62/412 at Bear Creek Springs and continuing as a four-lane expressway into Missouri. Legally, the Mississippi section of U.S. 65 is defined in Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3, as follows:  ""U.S. 65- Begins at the west end of the Mississippi River Bridge at Natchez, Adams County, and extends in an easterly direction to U.S. 61 and thence continues south jointly with U.S. 61 to the Mississippi-Louisiana state line south of Woodville, Wilkinson County."" Between 1994 and 2002, a freeway bypass of Des Moines was constructed and U.S. 65 moved to this new route.', 'You can navigate through our menu or use this search bar.

Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids. The misuse of and addiction to opioids, including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, is a serious national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total ""economic burden"" of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement. In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers, and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. This subsequently led to widespread diversion and misuse of these medications before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.3,4 Opioid overdose rates began to increase. In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.1That same year, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 652,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder (not mutually exclusive).

The community was named for Orin Hughitt, the uncle of a railroad official. Orin was the final place outlaw Doc Middleton owned and operated a saloon, before dying in the local jail in 1913. The community is located at the intersection of Interstate 25/U.S. Route 26/U.S. Route 87 and U.S. Route 18/U.S. Route 20. Orin is about 10 miles (16\xa0km) southeast of Douglas.

The crash spilled diesel fuel across that stretch of the Florida highway and killed seven people, according to authorities. Up to eight more people were taken to hospitals. New details about what occurred were being learned this morning. It will rank as one of the worst crashes in history on a route that is heavily traveled in Florida, especially this time of year with part-time residents and seasonal visitors spending time in the state. Drivers were blinded by a combination of fog and smoke caused by a nearby brush fire. The disaster scene ran for one mile along I-75, littered with the burned-out shells of up to 19 vehicles, including at least seven tractor-trailers. In zero-visibility conditions, a combination of smoke and fog, drivers headed into the deadly multi-car pileup. According to CBS News, visibility was so poor that when rescuers first arrived on the scene, they could locate victims only by listening for moans and screams. The interstate had been closed for a time before the crashes because of a mixture of the fog and the heavy smoke from the\xa0brush fire. The pileups happened around 3:45 a.m. on both sides of I-75. It was a Sunday. At least a dozen cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into flames. One passenger car had four fatalities. Twelve people were killed and 42 people were injured when dense fog formed within just a couple of hours just north of the Exit 36 bridge on I-75. Eventually, 99 cars were involved in the disastrous chain reaction collisions. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the cause of the collisions was varying driver response to the reduced visibility. It ranks as one of the worst traffic accidents of all time in the United States. Soon afterward, the Tennessee Department of Transportation installed a fog detection system, that once activated, alerted drivers with warning signs, flashing lights and lowered speed limits. Between October and March, the system is activated about once per week. The interstate has been closed twice since it was implemented. It has worked. There were over 200 crashes and 18 fatalities on the stretch of highway between 1973 and 1992. Since then, only one crash has occurred in fog. March 14, 2002Near Georgia-Tennessee lineAbout 125 vehicles, including 20 tractor-trailers, smashed into each other in thick fog that cut visibility to less than a car length on I-75 south of Chattanooga, Tennessee, killing four people, injuring 39 and backing up traffic for miles in each direction. December 31, 1998Grayling, MichiganA “white wall” of snow caused more than 125 vehicles to pile up on I-75, killing one motorist, injuring 50 and damaging dozens of cars, trucks and trailers.

What do building managers and business owners do to cover staff vacations? With reduced staff sizes and the desire to maintain high morale in the workplace, managers and owners strive to provide vacation time to their staffs—some creatively and some rather extreme. But one solution commonly overlooked is outsourcing when employees go on vacation or are out sick. It’s almost the end of summer and the vacations are mounting! What do building managers and business owners do to cover staff vacations? One business owner shared his approach in a recent article featured in the La Crosse Tribune (http://lacrossetribune. com/). Gary Harter, owner of Harter’s Quick Clean-Up, shuffles positions and even his own workload to ensure employees have vacation time. According to the article, shuffling staff so everyone gets a fair share of relaxation is a challenge. Harter steps in when necessary and he’s added an extra full-time position year round just to fill in when staff go on vacation or are out sick. With reduced staff sizes and the desire to maintain high morale in the workplace, managers and owners strive to provide vacation time to their staffs—some creatively and some rather extreme. But one solution commonly overlooked is outsourcing when employees go on vacation or are out sick. “When maintenance staff members are out on vacation, there can be stress on the employees left to handle everything,” says Troy Norberg, General Manager of Tru-Serve, Inc. (http://www. tru-serve. com/), a Minneapolis-St. Paul area property and building maintenance company. “Outsourcing helps by providing managers with the needed workers to get the job done without stretching employee morale thin.” Outsourcing is cost-effective and flexible. That’s a huge benefit for managers during high peak vacation time such as summer. Outsourcing can also allow building maintenance managers who have seasonal or cyclical demands to bring in the additional resources when needed and to release them when done. When partnering with an outsourced building maintenance company, building and facilities managers can be assured that qualified professionals will be available to cover for employees who call in sick. Having such backup means regular maintenance or projects get set aside or fall behind—an important advantage to outsourcing. According to Norberg (http://www. tru-serve. com/pages/DedicatedStaff/), “Outsourcing building maintenance gives property managers control to keep their facilities clean and in good repair even when permanent employees take those much deserved breaks from the job.” For over two decades, Tru-Serve (http://www. tru-serve. com/) has been meeting the property and building maintenance needs of clients in the healthcare, residential, commercial and nonprofit industries throughout the Minneapolis and St. Paul metro area. Founded on the belief that maintenance services can be comprehensive, exceptional and provided with personalized care, Tru-Serve consistently proves itself as a top maintenance and consulting services company.

Foreign investment is not big news to Arabic countries, but never before have we witnessed such a dramatic interest in the Arab world for real estate investment. Foreign investment is not big news to Arabic countries, but never before have we witnessed such a dramatic interest in the Arab world for real estate investment. It is reassuring to see that already in many Arab countries tourism figures are soaring, while in Sharjah, UAE, hotel revenues have increased by a staggering 25% since 2004. Government officials at a meeting of the Union of Arab Banks in Casablanca last week confirmed that along with tourism, foreign investment is set to increase significantly in the next three years, due to increased potential for trade as well as investment in the Moroccan travel and tourism industry. In Morocco doors are definitely opening to external investors. www. Propertyshowrooms. com is confident in the great potential return on investment this market will offer to our clients, while the six new developments currently in progress are just the beginning of an unprecedented influx of tourism. Large scale construction work is already crunching into the land, creating 6 emblematic luxury golf resorts of outstanding beauty all over Morocco, whilst measures are in place to maintain the natural beauty of their environments. The Moroccan government currently invests heavily in improving its economic sectors, including the infrastructure, telecommunications, electricity, banks, insurance, education, health services and maintaining them to the world-class standards expected from todays foreign investors. There has already been substantial reform within the legal framework, tax laws have been revised and generous fiscal incentives are available to invite external investors. A fascinating cultural heritage and distinctive natural beauty, from rocky coast to snow-capped mountains, as well as a climate conducive to year-round outdoor living all make Morocco a highly desirable holiday destination. Not to be forgotten is the projected plan to build a road link across the Straits of Gibraltar, enabling 10-15 million passengers to cross the bridge annually, along with 5 million tons of freight. Should this ambitious project go ahead, this would further unite Morocco with the European Union. Propertyshowrooms. com is currently offering some excellent investment options in emerging markets, including the Arab world.

Concerns about proposed changes to master\'s and doctoral education in nursing - in particular the call to generalist practice at the master\'s level and the doctorate as the only avenue to advanced practice - have been growing. In response, an April invitational gathering comprising representatives from across the entire nursing community -- public and private schools of nursing, nursing organizations, advanced practice nurses, and practice environments - considered ways to promote existing master\'s programs that clearly meet pressing needs such as nurse administrators and nurse educators while embracing new advanced practice educational preparations. The NLN\'s core values of caring, integrity, diversity, and excellence provided the foundation to understand divergent thinking and allowed the nursing community to come together and address vital issues. ""We discussed a number of key issues and questions: models of nursing education; the roles of master\'s prepared nurses; ways to increase diversity; and how to best collaborate with all stakeholders to fully embrace the advanced practice nursing role,"" said NLN president Cathleen Shultz, PhD, RN, CNE, FAAN. The resulting entry in the NLN\'s Reflection & Dialogue series, ""Master\'s Education in Nursing,"" delineates recommendations for nursing education to prepare nurses for specialty roles so that they can successfully deliver advanced practice nursing care. Taking into account the diverse voices of conference participants, the suggestions range from promoting MSN advanced specialty practice to meet regional health care needs to promoting the development of accessible and affordable academic progression models that will best serve the public and the nursing profession. Added Dr. Beverly Malone, NLN CEO, ""With health care reform a reality, there is a special urgency in our discussions. As noted in this latest Reflection & Dialogue, \'Time and focus are critical….Nursing must not be distracted from its core mission of providing safe, quality patient care and of stepping forward when the nation, through its legislative structure, has identified nurses as primary providers of care services.\' "" ""Master\'s Education in Nursing"" concludes with a series of questions designed to encourage reflection about this issue and invites others to join in the dialogue via the NLN website at http://www. nln. org/aboutnln/reflection_dialogue/index. htm (http://www. nln. org/aboutnln/reflection_dialogue/index. htm).

Following significant emission level improvements in recent months, Doe Run Peru (http://www. doerun. com. pe) has begun a review to update and establish new parameters for measuring the environmental conditions at its metals processing facility in La Oroya as part of its commitment to its environmental operating agreement with the Peruvian government, (known by its Spanish acronym, PAMA). The review was begun following a decision by the certification agency to suspend Doe Run Peru\'s 2006 ISO 14001 certification for the environmental management of the smelter. Doe Run Peru is updating emissions information about the La Oroya metallurgical complex to ensure that it aligns with the requirements for certification. Recently, representatives of the government\'s Ministry of Health/DIGESA, OSINERGMIN and CONAM discussed the significant reduction of emissions and improvement in air quality in La Oroya at a meeting of the Peruvian Congress. The government representatives also noted during the meeting that the environmental improvements in La Oroya in the 10 years since Doe Run Peru arrived there had resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of life in the community. ""For us it is fundamental that we have clear and transparent processes and that they be reflected in documents like the ISO certification that was granted to us years ago. Today the situation has changed, the improvements at La Oroya are evident and we think that this review and updating is appropriate at this time,"" said Jose Mogrovejo, Doe Run Peru\'s vice president for environmental affairs.

Hall and Praeger to discuss potential Obama healthcare reforms, Tom Daschle\'s recent holiday party plans, the dangers of federal regulation, subsidizing healthcare coverage for the \'Super Size Me\' crowd and more. Sandy Praeger, Insurance Commissioner for the state of Kansas, will appear this Saturday, January 10 at 12 pm CST, on Cary Hall\'s Health Insurance Advocate (http://www. thehealthinsuranceadvocate. com) program heard in the Midwest on the HIA Network. Praeger, also the immediate past president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, joins Hall to discuss whether president-elect Obama can effectively reform healthcare in the US, in light of the failing Massachusetts Connector program, a leading model under consideration by the soon-to-be Obama administration. With senators Kennedy, Bacchus and Daschle proposing healthcare reform plans that experts say do not reflect the current reality of economic crisis in the US, Hall intends to ask Praeger several pointed questions about what the American public might expect to see in the coming months. Praeger will also discuss the significant value of a state insurance commissioner\'s office to citizens. With millions of dollars in disputed claims recovered for Kansas citizens in 2008, Praeger is expected to present an air-tight case against a push for placing the insurance industry under a federal regulatory body. As in other editions of the Health Insurance Advocate program, Hall will address the national diabetes and obesity crises and other serious and costly health conditions generally related to behavioral and lifestyle choices. With 70 percent of chronic illnesses resulting from lifestyle choices, Hall says he looks forward to gaining additional insight from Praeger for how to deal with exorbitant costs incurred by the average healthy consumer on behalf of others who invite poor health and illness due to lifestyle choices. Hall also plans to discuss self-funded health insurance plans, ever increasing health care utilization, the medical amenities American citizens stand to lose in a national health care scenario, the strength of the insurance industry in the face of surrounding economic crises, and more. Listeners are encouraged to tune in to the HIA Network (http://www. thehealthinsuranceadvocate. com), this Saturday at 12 pm CST.

Being prepared today can make for a much better tomorrow. With constantly changing weather conditions and the reality of global warming, pets and their owners can easily become the next victims of a natural disaster.

In recent years, many temporary emergency shelters have welcomed pets into their facilities with their owners.

Users at mypetsoft. com can create and maintain comprehensive pet profiles for one, or many family pets, throughout their pet\'s lifetime. The reports can be viewed or edited online, emailed as a PDF document, or printed and distributed manually.

When people are faced with evacuation notices, or worse case, orders to evacuate now, they are way past the time for emergency preparation.

Johnny Prytko, a Manchester, Connecticut native, was recently featured in Manchester Life for having promoted polka with his radio show and polka bands for over 50 years. Johnny Prytko, a Manchester, Connecticut resident, was recently featured in Manchester Life for continuously promoting polka for over 50 years with his own polka radio shows and polka bands. The reason Prytko feels so strongly about polka is because, as he said in the feature, ""Polkas are happy, like a healthy dose of medicine."" Prytko has been playing polka since his father bought him an accordion when he was 13, and has since then been in the polka bands the Polka Dukes, The Connecticut Hi Tones and The Good Times Band, which have recorded 6 albums of polka music and appeared in various polka festivals and dances throughout the northeast and east coast. Prytko began promoting polka via radio waves in 1984 when he and friend Ted Niehay were commissioned to start a polka show at WINF an AM radio station in Manchester. When the program ended in 1988, the duo went to WWUH, the University of Hartford FM station in West Hartford, Connecticut. The radio show, Polka Madness, features a variety of music from old pop favorites to a mix of Polish, Slovenian, French and German music. What really keeps Prytko\'s show interesting is the fact that he advocates songs with English lyrics and a variety of styles of music because he realizes that Polka, like every other type of music, must adapt to fit the times. Graduate Apprenticeship Scheme set to assist entry into the translation profession. Roevin Translation Services (www. roevin. co. uk/translation (http://www. roevin. co. uk/translation)), a leading language translation company with a global network of translation experts, today announced their participation in the Steering Group for the ""Graduate Apprenticeship Scheme"", a pilot scheme which aims to offer MA students in Translation Studies a high quality structured work placement within a professional translation organisation. The Graduate Apprenticeship Scheme hopes to secure funding as part of a forthcoming proposal for support to the Department for Education and Skills Gateways Development Fund. The proposal, to be submitted by CILT, the national centre for languages, covers four strands of work designed to improve recruitment and retention into the professions, including the translation profession. As well as CILT, members of the Steering Group include the Association of Translation Companies, the Universities of Aston, Salford, Leeds, Westminster, Imperial College (University of London) and London Metropolitan University as well as five translation companies, including Roevin. The DfES report ""Languages for All: Languages for Life"" outlines some of the issues affecting language learning in England which could impact on the translation profession, and presents the government\'s strategy for transforming language learning in England. A statement from the Chair following the July 2006 meeting of the G8 leaders in St Petersburg, identified languages as a \'critical area\' of education for the 21st century. a decline in numbers of students taking languages at A - level (fewer than 5% of the total entries) a lack of students studying language to degree level and beyond (fewer than 3% of students enrolled on first degree courses studying language subjects in 2000/1) a shortage of modern language teachers at secondary level a skills gap between new university graduates and employment opportunities in the global economy. The impact of these issues is that there is likely to be an acute shortage of native English speaking translators in the future and those who do graduate in translation studies are not necessarily ""work ready"". Measures proposed in the DfES report include increasing the number of Specialist Language Colleges, using ICT to raise the quality of teaching materials and working with higher education institutions to promote the advantages of taking courses which include languages. Another measure is to introduce foreign language classes into every primary school by 2010. Pilot schemes have been very successful and provide evidence that young children, encouraged in a positive manner, are receptive to learning new languages. Roevin, sponsor of the awards for ""Achievement in Translation"" for undergraduates and ""Excellence in Translation"" for postgraduates, at Aston and Salford Universities, is committed to promoting excellence in the field of translation studies and improving links between higher education institutions and the commercial world. By offering high quality structured work placements for postgraduate students through the Graduate Apprenticeship Scheme, Roevin hopes to help raise the profile of the translation industry and help bridge the gap between education and the commercial world. Roevin offers language translation services, localisation, multilanguage desktop publishing and interpreting services to global organisations in a wide range of fields including mechanical engineering, healthcare, control and instrumentation, legal, financial, industrial and consumer electronics and process manufacturing. Roevin offers translation services in over 100 language pairs with French, Spanish, German, Chinese and Japanese translations currently the most commonly requested. The company is respected for tight turnaround times, accuracy and their professional experience in a wide range of publishing formats.

A new autobiography by the founder of Weight Watchers, “The Story of Jean Nidetch,” has been enthusiastically received by Weight Watchers members and other readers lucky enough to find copies of the limited edition book. “The Story of Jean Nidetch: An Autobiography” was published by Weight Watchers and made available to members for purchase early this year. Jean Nidetch founded the company in 1963 and served as a high profile, globe-trotting spokesperson for many years, until she retired in 1994. Copies of Jean’s book quickly sold out in the meeting locations where they were available, but it can still be purchased on Amazon. com (priced at $12.95). Though not easy to find and not in stores, the book is quickly becoming an underground WW cult classic. Bloggers, chat rooms and discussion groups are bubbling with praise for the 86-year-old’s memoir. “I am now on my 3rd read of her autobiography,” writes one poster on the official WW Web site. “I was incredibly inspired by her story,” writes another. “Jean lost over 70 pounds and continues to maintain her weight loss 45 years later.” “I wish Oprah would have her on! THAT would be gold!” enthuses a third. One anonymous fan has even dedicated a Facebook page to Nidetch. The book has a Foreword by Nidetch’s old friend, Maya Angelou and an Introduction by Weight Watchers President David Kirchhoff. Kirchhoff himself attended the kick-off book signing in Boca Raton, Florida in February. A March 22 USA Today article about that event went viral as it was picked up, linked, blogged and tweeted all over the U. S. and at least as far as the U. K. and Australia, where Jean is still well-known and revered. A favorite Jean Nidetch quote from the book: “I was on a panel once at which everyone else had a card in front of them with initials like PhD., M. D., M. S.N….I felt funny that I had no initials after my name, so I picked up my name card and wrote ‘F. F.H.’ When asked what it stood for, I said, ‘Formerly Fat Housewife’.” Another Weight Watchers member raves: “I picked [the book] up at a WW meeting last month, and I just finished reading it. I couldn’t put it down. This amazing woman went from self-proclaimed ‘fat housewife’ to the world-renowned founder of Weight Watchers. Her struggle and ultimate victory over her weight problem, combined with the vision and positive attitude she…had to start such a revolutionary concept back in the Sixties is just so inspiring…” She went on to say that reading Jean’s book made her feel a deeper connection to Weight Watchers and “It really makes me appreciate meetings more.” Weight Watchers has had several spokespersons since Nidetch retired, including Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. The newest is Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson. Still, it’s hard to see how Weight Watchers could ever find anyone better than their own founder.

The Renaissance Charleston Hotel Historic District has made groundbreaking strides in the area, becoming the first official hotel in the city to remove all trans fats from hotel menus and other food outlets. The elimination, according to Marriott International, is the culmination of an eight-year effort to remove trans fats from the vast majority of food served at more than 2,300 Marriott International hotels throughout the U. S. and Canada. ""We are pleased to announce the hotel\'s transition to trans fat-free menus,"" said Bryan Thompson, director of sales and marketing for the hotel. ""Our conversion is in tandem with Marriott International\'s commitment to being an industry leader in helping its guests to live healthy lifestyles.""

PrecisionCraft’s Caribou log home plan has inspired custom log homes across the United States – from handcrafted to timber frame to Mountain Accent, each home is unique. Modified to match each client’s unique style, build location and budget, the Caribou dream has been realized in Ohio, California, Wyoming, Washington, Pennsylvania, Arizona, West Virginia, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Texas and Colorado. Featured at http://www. loghomes. org, the official website of The Log Homes Council, Caribou enthusiasts can take a look at the original Caribou design and see photos of actual log homes inspired by this award-winning plan. The Caribou design is featured this April at http://www. loghomes. org (http://www. loghomes. org), the official website of The Log Homes Council. The Caribou log home design (http://www. precisioncraft. com/loghomeplans/Adirondack/Caribou. html) first landed in the limelight in 2007. Created by Mountain Architects, PrecisionCraft’s award-winning team of log home designers (http://www. precisioncraft. com/DesignBuild/ConceptualDesign. html), the design earned “Best Single-Level Floor Plan” by Log Home Design magazine. After that auspicious start, the Caribou has remained one of the company’s most popular designs, says Jim Young, president of PrecisionCraft in Meridian, ID. “Since we created this design in 2007, 15 of our clients have opted to use this design as the basis for their dream home. This year we have five more clients who are building variations of the design. People are drawn to its healthy mix of beauty and functionality.” The Caribou is also this month’s Featured Home at http://www. loghomes. org (http://www. loghomes. org), the official website of the Log Homes Council (http://www. loghomes. org), part of the National Association of Home Builders (http://www. nahb. org). The Caribou continued to attract rave reviews. In 2008, the plan was once again recognized as “Best of the Best” in Log Home Living’s 10th Annual Floor Plan Contest. The panel of judges favored the design for its single-level floor plan living, split bedroom layout, integration with the outdoors, and use of a massive three-fireplace structure. More accolades arrived in 2010. Katherine Schuster at Log Home Living recognized the Caribou’s unique features. “The angled entry porch adds a unique architectural element to the home from the moment you set foot inside the door. The rest of the home is just as captivating,” Schuster said. “The communal areas blend together seamlessly, and the transition to outdoor living space is just as effortless, providing an ideal setup for entertaining,” Schuster said. “A three-fireplace structure that can be enjoyed from the living room, outdoor patio or master bedroom extends the cohesiveness to the bedroom wing. The home is cozy and intimate without being cramped. It will serve its owners well, for many years to come.” Katherine’s prediction held true.

NLN to Present Awards for Outstanding Leadership and Lifetime Achievement; 24 Fellows to be Inducted into Nursing Education Academy; Banquet Will Conclude 2008 Education Summit on Saturday, September 20. The NLN Awards and Academy of Nursing Education Fellows Induction Ceremony is an annual highlight of the National League for Nursing Education Summit, and this year\'s program promises to be no exception. Set for the evening of Saturday, September 20, it will cap the four-day gathering of nurse educators and administrators at the Marriott Rivercenter in San Antonio, TX. Throughout the years, Kathy Mershon evidenced outstanding leadership, service, and commitment to the mission of the NLN. As the chair of the NLN Board Development Committee, she worked on developing policies and procedures to assure continuity in board membership. As the chair of the NLN Nominating Committee, she introduced improved matrixes to assure that all leadership criteria are assessed appropriately. It is in her role as leader of the NLN Foundation that Mershon\'s contributions to the NLN and the nursing community have been most distinguished. Throughout her tenure as chairperson of the NLN Foundation for Nursing Education, Kathy\'s wise guidance has resulted in continued growth and significant enhancements to the mission and organizational operations of the NLN Foundation. Dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Dr. Conway-Welch has developed innovative programs fostering new ways of advancing nursing education and garnered prestigious appointments, including service on the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Dr. Conway-Welch helped create a partnership between Vanderbilt and Botswana Universities\' Schools of Nursing for a hospital project in Botswana. She has worked to increase funding for nursing students from diverse backgrounds and began a bridge program at Vanderbilt to facilitate entry into the MSN program for graduates of associate degree nursing programs and those with bachelor\'s degrees in other fields. Dr. Conway-Welch was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 1997, when it was still rare for nurses to be selected; named to the Advisory Committee to the director of the National Institutes of Health; and represented the nursing community on numerous national advisory committees on disaster preparedness. A renowned expert in gerontology, since 2001, Dr. May Wykle has been dean of the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University. For more than two decades, she has also been director of the University Center on Aging and Health University and has overseen one of the nation\'s first certificate courses in gerontology. Through this position, she has mentored young faculty to follow in her footsteps as leaders in gerontology. Dr. Wykle has led the way in hiring minority faculty and promoting research of minority populations. The critical mass of minority faculty at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing has been a major factor in increasing the number of minority students at the school, from the bachelor to doctoral level, thus producing a substantial number of next generation practicing nurses, educators, and researchers who are members of minority groups equipped to address minority health care and issues of health disparities. Her untiring efforts demonstrate that private schools of nursing, such as Case Western Reserve, can achieve racial, ethnic and gender diversity. Traveling abroad extensively, she witnessed the interconnection of poverty and health in developing countries, which led her to initiate nursing education programs with components in gerontology in Europe, Africa, and Asia. In 2007, Case Western established the May L. Wykle Endowed Professorship in honor of her outstanding career and remarkable contributions to knowledge development, leadership, and mentorship. Remarkably, the professorship was funded through contributions by former students, practicing nurses, colleagues in the fields of mental health and gerontology, and members of the communities she has served throughout her distinguished career.

Employees throughout Omaha voted on the best companies to work for and Medical Solutions topped the list of companies with 50-250 local employees in just its first year entering the competition. President and CEO Scott Anderson is pleased the hard work of the company is being recognized, but is more proud of the team that has been built at Medical Solutions. ""We are excited Medical Solutions is a company employees are happy to work for, but more importantly we are truly appreciative of each and every individual that makes up the Medical Solutions team. This award is really about them,"" Anderson said.

For Medical Solutions, treating employees well means putting them in the best position to succeed. They do this by giving the individuals the room to learn and grow and the resources they need to thrive.

(Die-hards like me) https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3/zombies It seems to be some type of Cuneiform script. But modified or fictitious? I have not decoded it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform http://www.ancient.eu/cuneiform/ Cuneiform script is one of the earliest known systems of writing, distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. The name cuneiform itself simply means ""wedge shaped"", from the Latin cuneus ""wedge"" and forma ""shape,"" and came into English usage probably from Old French cunéiforme. Emerging in Sumer in the late 4th millennium B.C.E. (the Uruk IV period), cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. In the third millennium, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller, from about 1,000 in the Early Bronze Age to about 400 in Late Bronze Age (Hittite cuneiform). The system consists of a combination of logophonetic, consonantal alphabetic and syllabic signs. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, and Urartian languages, and it inspired the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets. Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the Phoenician alphabet during the Neo-Assyrian Empire. By the 2nd century C.E., the script had become extinct, and all knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization The cradle of civilization is a term referring to locations where, according to current archeological date, civilization is understood to have emerged independently. Scholars have defined civilization using various criteria such as the use of writing, a class-based society, public buildings, metallurgy, and monumental architecture. Current thinking is that there was no single ""cradle"", but several civilizations that developed independently, of which the Near Eastern Neolithic (Mesopotamia and Egypt) was the first. Historically, the ancient city states of Mesopotamia in the fertile crescent are most cited by Western and Middle Eastern scholars as the cradle of civilization. The convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation. The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies. Because Ubaid, Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylon civilizations all emerged around the Tigris-Euphrates, the theory that Mesopotamia is the cradle of civilization is widely accepted. The Mesopotamian civilization of Sumer emerges in the Ubaid period (6500-3800 BC) and Uruk period (ca. 4000 to 3100 BC), culminating in the mid-3rd millennium before giving rise to the Akkadian Empire in the 24th century BC. This is often identified as the first empire in history. Eridu was the oldest Sumerian site, settled during the proto-civilized Ubaid period. Situated several miles southwest of Ur, Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of early temple-cities, in Sumer, southern Mesopotamia, with the earliest of these settlements dating to around 5000 BC. By the 4th millennium BC in Nippur — in connection with a sort of ziggurat and shrine — a conduit built of bricks in the form of an arch. Sumerian inscriptions written on clay also appear in Nippur. By 4000 BC an ancient Elamite city of Susa, in Mesopotamia, also seems to emerge from earlier villages. Whilst the Elamites originally had their own script, from an early age they adapted the Sumerian cuneiform script to their own language. The earliest recognizable cuneiform dates to no later than about 3500 BC. Other villages that began to spring up around this time in the Ancient Near East (Middle East) were greatly impacted and shifted rapidly from a proto-civilized to a fully civilized state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia Mesopotamia - ""land of rivers"" - is a name for the area of the Tigris–Euphrates river system, corresponding to modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, the northeastern section of Syria and to a much lesser extent southeastern Turkey and smaller parts of southwestern Iran. Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization by the Western world, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires, all native to the territory of modern-day Iraq. In the Iron Age, it was controlled by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires. The indigenous Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians and Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon Babylon was a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, in the fertile plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The city was built upon the Euphrates, and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river\'s seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Semitic Akkadian city dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c. 2300 BC. The town attained independence as part of a small city state with the rise of the First Amorite Babylonian Dynasty in 1894 BC. Claiming to be the successor of the more ancient Sumero-Akkadian city of Eridu, Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the ""holy city"" of Mesopotamia around the time Amorite king Hammurabi created the first short lived Babylonian Empire in the 18th century BC. Babylon grew and South Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one whose location has not been definitely established. The Hanging Gardens were a distinctive feature of ancient Babylon. They were a great source of pride to the people, and were often described in accounts written by visitors to the city. Possibly built by King Nebuchadnezzar II in 600 BC, the gardens are believed to have been a remarkable feat of engineering: an ascending series of tiered gardens containing all manner of trees, shrubs, and vines. The gardens were said to have looked like a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks, rising from the center of the city. Traditionally they were said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel The Tower of Babel is a story told in the Book of Genesis of the Tanakh (also referred to as the Hebrew Bible) meant to explain the origin of different languages. According to the story, a united humanity of the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, came to the land of Shinar. [The name Shinar occurs eight times in the Hebrew Bible, in which it refers to Babylonia. This location of Shinar is evident from its description as encompassing both Babel (Babylon) (in northern Babylonia) and Erech (Uruk) (in southern Babylonia)]. The Tower of Babel has been associated with known structures according to some modern scholars, notably the Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Marduk by Nabopolassar, king of Babylonia (c. 610 BC). The Great Ziggurat of Babylon was 91 metres (300 ft) in height. Alexander the Great ordered it demolished circa 331 BCE in preparation for a reconstruction that his death forestalled. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower_of_Babel_(Bruegel) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk Marduk was a late-generation god from ancient Mesopotamia and patron deity of the city of Babylon. When Babylon became the political center of the Euphrates valley in the time of Hammurabi (18th century BC), he slowly started to rise to the position of the head of the Babylonian pantheon, a position he fully acquired by the second half of the second millennium BC. In the city of Babylon, he resided in the temple Esagila. ""Marduk"" is the Babylonian form of his name. Marduk\'s original character is obscure but he was later associated with water, vegetation, judgment, and magic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etemenanki Etemenanki ""temple of the foundation of heaven and earth"") was the name of a ziggurat dedicated to Marduk in the city of Babylon of the 6th century BCE Neo-Babylonian dynasty. Originally 91 meters in height, little remains of it now except ruins. The city of Babylon had been destroyed in 689 BCE by Sennacherib, who claims to have destroyed the Etemenanki. The city was restored by Nabopolassar and his son Nebuchadnezzar II. It took 88 years to rebuild the city; its central feature was the temple of Marduk (Esagila), with which the Etemenanki ziggurat was associated. The ziggurat was rebuilt by Nebuchadnezzar II. The seven stories of the ziggurat reached a height of 91 meters, according to a tablet from Uruk (see below), and contained a temple shrine at the top. The tower, the eternal house, which I founded and built. I have completed its magnificence with silver, gold, other metals, stone, enameled bricks, fir and pine. The first which is the house of the earth’s base, the most ancient monument of Babylon; I built and finished it. I have highly exalted its head with bricks covered with copper. We say for the other, that is, this edifice, the house of the seven lights of the earth the most ancient monument of Borsippa. A former king built it, (they reckon 42 ages) but he did not complete its head. Since a remote time, people had abandoned it, without order expressing their words. Since that time the earthquake and the thunder had dispersed the sun-dried clay. The bricks of the casing had been split, and the earth of the interior had been scattered in heaps. Merodach, the great god, excited my mind to repair this building. I did not change the site nor did I take away the foundation. In a fortunate month, in an auspicious day, I undertook to build porticoes around the crude brick masses, and the casing of burnt bricks. I adapted the circuits, I put the inscription of my name in the Kitir of the portico. I set my hand to finish it. And to exalt its head. As it had been done in ancient days, so I exalted its summit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_of_Ur The Ziggurat of Ur meaning ""house whose foundation creates terror"") is a Neo-Sumerian ziggurat in what was the city of Ur near Nasiriyah, in present-day Dhi Qar Province, Iraq. The structure was built during the Early Bronze Age (21st century BC), but had crumbled to ruins by the 6th century BC of the Neo-Babylonian period when it was restored by King Nabonidus. The remains of the ziggurat consist of a three-layered solid mass of mud brick faced with burnt bricks set in bitumen. The lowest layer corresponds to the original construction of Ur-Nammu, while the two upper layers are part of the Neo-Babylonian restorations. The façade of the lowest level and the monumental staircase were rebuilt under the orders of Saddam Hussein. The ziggurat was damaged in the First Gulf War in 1991 by small arms fire and the structure was shaken by explosions. Four bomb craters can be seen nearby and the walls of the ziggurat are marred by over 400 bullet holes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II Nebuchadnezzar II was an Assyrian king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, who reigned c. 605 BC – 562 BC. Both the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalem\'s temple are ascribed to him. After the fall of Jerusalem, the Babylonian general Nebuzaraddan was sent to complete its destruction. Jerusalem was plundered and Solomon\'s Temple was destroyed. Most of the elite were taken into captivity in Babylon. The city was razed to the ground. Nebuchadnezzar is credited by Berossus with the construction of the Hanging Gardens, for his homesick wife Amyitis (or Amytis) to remind her of her homeland, Medis (Media) in Persia. He is also credited for the construction of the Ishtar Gate, one of the eight gates leading into the city of Babylon. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishtar_Gate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En%C3%BBma_Eli%C5%A1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark Now, cue the Aliens (just google Ancient Astronauts. Sumerians are all over it)~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronaut_hypothesis The ancient astronaut or ancient alien hypothesis is a pseudoscientific hypothesis that posits that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistory.\xa0Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of human cultures, technologies, and religions. A common claim is that deities from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrial in nature, and that such visitors\' advanced technologies were interpreted by early humans as evidence of divine status. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki The Anunnaki are a group of deities in ancient Mesopotamian cultures (i.e., Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Babylonian). The Anunnaki appear in the Babylonian creation myth, Enuma Elish. In the late version magnifying Marduk, after the creation of mankind, Marduk divides the Anunnaki and assigns them to their proper stations, three hundred in heaven, three hundred on the earth. The Anunnaki are mentioned in The Epic of Gilgamesh when Utnapishtim tells the story of the flood. The seven judges of hell are called the Anunnaki, and they set the land aflame as the storm is approaching. http://www.sitchin.com https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin Zecharia Sitchin (July 11, 1920 – October 9, 2010) was a Soviet-born American author of books proposing an explanation for human origins involving ancient astronauts. Sitchin attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Anunnaki, which he states was a race of extraterrestrials from a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru. He believed this hypothetical planet of Nibiru to be in an elongated, elliptical orbit in the Earth\'s own Solar System, asserting that Sumerian mythology reflects this view. According to Sitchin\'s interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book The 12th Planet and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune that follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology). According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the Enûma Eliš), which he considers to be another planet once located between Mars and Jupiter. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru\'s moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru\'s moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today\'s planet Earth. According to Sitchin, Nibiru (called ""the twelfth planet"" because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians\' gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the Anunnaki in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the Nephilim in Genesis. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system and first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these ""gods"" were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru. Sitchin wrote that Enki suggested that to relieve the Anunnaki, who had mutinied over their dissatisfaction with their working conditions, that primitive workers (Homo sapiens) be created by genetic engineering as slaves to replace them in the gold mines by crossing extraterrestrial genes with those of Homo erectus. According to Sitchin, ancient inscriptions report that the human civilization in Sumer, Mesopotamia, was set up under the guidance of these ""gods"", and human kingship was inaugurated to provide intermediaries between mankind and the Anunnaki (creating the ""divine right of kings"" doctrine). Sitchin believes that fallout from nuclear weapons, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the ""evil wind"" described in the Lament for Ur that destroyed Ur around 2000 BC. Sitchin states the exact year is 2024 BC. Sitchin says that his research coincides with many biblical texts, and that biblical texts come originally from Sumerian writings. (Sitchin\'s ideas have been rejected by scientists and academics, who dismiss his work as pseudoscience and pseudohistory. His work has been criticized for flawed methodology and mistranslations of ancient texts as well as for incorrect astronomical and scientific claims) Thank you Faust & E.J. for showing me some of H.P. Lovecraft’s characters, as I am not very educated on his work. Interesting stories that may relate to this Zombies storline are “The Call of Cthulhu”. It mentioned voodoo in New Orleans (if that still relates at all?) & the story “The Nameless City”. H. P. Lovecraft http://www.hplovecraft.com https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu Cthulhu is a deity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft and first introduced in the short story ""The Call of Cthulhu"", published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, the creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts Cthulhu as a gigantic entity worshiped by cultists. Cthulhu\'s anatomy is described as part octopus, part man, and part dragon. A sketch of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft in 1934. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nameless_City ""The Nameless City"" is a horror story written by H. P. Lovecraft in January 1921 and first published in the November 1921 issue of the amateur press journal The Wolverine. It is often considered the first Cthulhu Mythos story. The Nameless City of the story\'s title is an ancient ruin located somewhere in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and is older than any human civilization. In ancient times, the Nameless City was built and inhabited by an unnamed race of reptiles with a body shaped like a cross between a crocodile and a seal with a strange head common to neither, involving a protruding forehead, horns, lack of a nose and an alligator-like jaw. These beings moved by crawling; thus, the architecture of the city has very low ceilings and some places are too low for a human being to stand upright. Their city was originally coastal, but when the seas receded it was left in the depths of a desert. This resulted in the decline and eventual ruin of the city. Indeed, the reptilians still maintain some form of life in a vast, luminous paradise in a cavern beneath the Nameless City, preserved and placed along the walls in a subterranean chamber. Also within this chamber are hieroglyphs and reliefs that tell to the protagonist the story of the city\'s heyday of prosperity and its fall, as well as their eventual hatred of humanity. And with strange aeons even death may die."" Now, this seems wacked & completely irrelevant on how it relates to what we\'ve been shown with Shadows of Evil & The Giant, but something within this wall of text is possible. What I would really like to see & have as a map would be ""The Hanging Gardens on Babylon"", something to do with ""Noah\'s Ark"" & \'The Great Flood"". How to fix the world & end Zombies? - Wipe it all out with the Great Flood, just like the Biblical stories of the Tower of Babel. Cool stuff. Wasn\'t the Tranzit EE called\xa0Tower of Babble? Cool stuff. Wasn\'t the Tranzit EE called\xa0Tower of Babble? Yes and it was a reference to the Tower of Babel, which is its real name. I\'m surprised to see the lack of Vril-ya references in this thread! \xa0Your entire section on the Annunaki is essentially describing the Vril-ya, @PINNAZ. \xa0You mention the following: They were ""a group of deities in ancient Mesopotamian cultures,"" who ""were a race of extraterrestrials from a planet beyond Neptune call Nibiru."" \xa0You say that ""Nibiru was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the Anunnaki in Sumerian myth,"" but the name Nibiru ""was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself."" \xa0You then state that the ""technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race"" were ""the Nephilim from Genesis."" \xa0You also say that ""the fallout from nuclear weapons, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the evil wind described in the Lament for Ur that destroyed Ur around 2000 B.C."" “The Aryans (light God people) started to colonize other Earth-like planets” and “it is said that in our system, they first colonized the planet Mallona, also called Marduk, which existed in the area of today\'s asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Mars was next. \xa0They then inhabited Earth, and landed in ancient Sumer, which was a civilization and historical region in southern Mesopotamia. \xa0Allegedly, the word Vril was formed from the ancient Sumerian word ""Vri-Il"" (""like god"").” After splitting into two factions (one good and one evil), “one group arrived in Atlantis and believed that all the less-evolved cultures should be brought under sway by the two evolved ones, which didn\'t go over well with the Lemurians, as they had different views. \xa0This caused a series of wars between Atlantis and Lemuria. In these series of wars, thermonuclear devices were used, and when the wars were over and the dust cleared, in reality there was no winner.” Additionally, you only mention ziggurat’s once (in relation to the biblical Tower of Babel), but it should also be mentioned that the Shangri-La temple is a ziggurat. \xa0Described as “a pyramidal structure with a flat top,” an archaeologist stated that “it is usually assumed that the ziggurats supported a shrine,” while “the god Marduk was once said to come and sleep in his shrine.” Yet again with Marduk being mentioned, so I think we ought to get some background on him. \xa0Marduk is “a late-generation god from ancient Mesopotamia,” and it’s said that though his “original character is obscure, … he was later associated with water, vegetation, judgment, and magic.” \xa0When Babylon became the powerful city we think of it as, Marduk “was elevated to the level of supreme god.” \xa0When “the Anunnaki gods gathered together to find one god who could defeat the gods rising against them,” Marduk “answered the call and was promised the position of head god.” Now, we know that in Biblical stories, the Devil and his following were cast from Heaven and are referred to as Fallen Angels. Some say that ""In Biblical terms, the Fallen Ones never left Earth"" and actually ""engineered and maintained"" ""the New World Order"" ""through 300 of their human descendants who call themselves the Illuminati."" Right here, we see a clear connection between the Illuminati and the Fallen Angels, led by the Devil. Remember how I said that the Aryan Vril-ya split into two factions when arriving on Earth? The ""good"" faction are the ones referred to as the Anunnuki, and in Sumerian terms, the faction that was ""evil"" were referred to as ""the Igigi."" The leader of the Igigi, or ""evil"" faction, was Marduk, who\'s Hebrew translation is ""the adversary."" Christians refer to Marduk as the the adversary of mankind: the Devil. This is the group that then traveled south, towards Tibet, and founded Shangri-La. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk http://www.ashtarcommandcrew.net/forum/topics/anunnaki-and-illuminati-at-war-now Nobody has received reputation this week.

It was nominally a federal union of multiple national republics; in practice its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. The country was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with Moscow as its capital within its largest and most populous republic, the Russian SFSR. Other major urban centers were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. It was the largest country in the world, covering over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500\xa0sq\xa0mi), and spanning eleven time zones. The\xa0Ottoman Empire, also historically known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire or simply Turkey, was a state that controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia and North Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of Söğüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans, the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state mostly located on the Iberian Peninsula in Europe. The country\'s mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Spanish territory includes two large archipelagoes, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the African Atlantic coast, two cities, Ceuta and Melilla, on the African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the African coast. Spain is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco). Nazi Germany is the common English name for Germany between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party (NSDAP) controlled the country through a dictatorship. Under Hitler\'s rule, Germany was transformed into a totalitarian state that controlled nearly all aspects of life via the Gleichschaltung legal process. The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich until 1943 and Großdeutsches Reich from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany is also known as the Third Reich, from German Drittes Reich, meaning ""Third Realm"" or ""Third Empire"", the first two being the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire. The Nazi regime ended after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The Roman Empire was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa and West Asia ruled by emperors. From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century, it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and its city of Rome as sole capital. Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis, the empire was forcibly reassembled, then ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire and over the Eastern Roman Empire. Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD, when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustus. The fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings, along with the hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire into the Byzantine Empire, conventionally marks the end of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The Mughal Empire or Mogul Empire was an empire in the Indian subcontinent, founded in 1526. It was established and ruled by a Muslim dynasty with Turco-Mongol Chagatai roots from Central Asia, but with significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances; only the first two Mughal emperors were fully Central Asian, while successive emperors were of predominantly Rajput and Persian ancestry. The dynasty was Indo-Persian in culture, combining Persianate culture with local Indian cultural influences visible in its traits and customs. The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople. It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both ""Byzantine Empire"" and ""Eastern Roman Empire"" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire, or Romania (Ῥωμανία), and to themselves as ""Romans."" The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars by French emperor Napoleon I. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the neighboring Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. The Maratha Empire or the Maratha Confederacy was an Indian power that dominated much of the Indian subcontinent in the 17th and 18th century. The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji and ended in 1818 with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India. The Confederate States of America, commonly referred to as the Confederacy and the South, was an unrecognized country in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865. The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states—South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas—in the Lower South region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. Yugoslavia was a country in Southeastern and Central Europe for most of the 20th century. It came into existence after World War I in 1918 under the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. The Serbian royal House of Karađorđević became the Yugoslav royal dynasty. Yugoslavia gained international recognition on 13 July 1922 at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris. The country was named after the South Slavic peoples and constituted their first union, following centuries in which the territories had been part of the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. The German Empire, also known as Imperial Germany, was the German nation state that existed from the Unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1918. Prussia was a historically prominent German state that originated in 1525 with a duchy centred on the region of Prussia. It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in Königsberg and from 1701 in Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany.

where is the real hotel from the shining,"['OMG…we can’t seem to get out of the state of Colorado, we enjoy it so much. \xa0We took a ride to Estes Park where\xa0The Stanley Hotel,\xa0 a 420-room Colonial Revival hotel\xa0is located. \xa0Approximately five miles from the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rockies and especially Long’s Peak. It was built by Freelan Oscar Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame and opened on July 4, 1909, catering to the American upper class at the turn of the century. The hotel and its surrounding structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Stanley Hotel also hosted the horror novelist Stephen King, serving as inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in his 1977 bestseller The Shining and location for the 1997 miniseries. Today, it includes a restaurant, spa, and bed-and-breakfast and provides guided tours which feature the history and alleged paranormal activity of the site. (From Wikipedia). \xa0The story of the Stanley brothers is one worth reading. \xa0The hotel has a number of rooms open to the public to stay and for business and wedding functions. I’d love to stay there but probably wouldn’t get much sleep. Front lobby. Conference room. Basement where the staff worked. \xa0The guests never saw the staff. \xa0They traveled back and forth in these tunnels. Spooky pictures, but loved them. The Shining still gives me chills up the back of my neck. When did you have time to work? Our guide thought there was something there also, and asked us to send a copy to the management. The mirror thing was super weird.  Lee always wanted to take me there but I was like no way.  See smart lol Ha ha if you spook easy, then this place will get to you. There were a couple of kids in our group and the guide had them run down to the end of the hall and they disappeared and reappeared just like in the movie. What most people don’t know is Stephen King did not like Kubrick’s interpretation of his book, so he shot his own mini series for ABC. “The Shining” mini series ran on ABC in 1997.

From hospitals and asylums, to cemeteries, schools, theaters, restaurants, parks, bridges, and even roads, there\'s an endless amount of places throughout the state that are said to have some ghostly spirits lingering. Some of these creepy spots are located in the biggest of cities that everyone knows about, and others in small towns that only locals may know of.\xa0Take a peek below to check out our Top 10 Haunted Places in the state of Colorado!1. Stanley Hotel - Estes Park, COPhoto by Congovo, via FlickrDating back to 1909, the Stanley Hotel gained fame after being featured in the classic horror film by Stephen King, ""The Shining."" Located just four miles from Rocky Mountain National Park, this hotel features 420 rooms and offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rockies and Long\'s Peak. The hotel was built\xa0by Freelan Oscar Stanley and Flora Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame and opened on July 4, 1909, catering to the American upper class at the turn of the century.It has had a number of haunting reports, and the hotel even hosts guided tours of the place which feature the history and alleged paranormal activity on the property. It has been rumored that Flora Stanley herself haunts the hotel, as one of her favorite past times was playing the piano, which has been heard being played late at night when no one is around. A number of rooms have had reported activity, including Room 217 and Room 401, which is said to have a haunted closet where a main is seen standing. A spirit that is believed to be a long term housekeeper of the Stanley\'s is said to be the spirit lingering in Room 217. Stories say if she likes you, she\'ll help you unpack your luggage!2. Molly Brown House - Denver, COPhoto by Ken Lund, via FlickrLocated on Pennsylvania Street in Denver, the Molly Brown House was the home Margaret Brown, an American philanthropist, socialite and activist. She also survived the sinking of The Titanic. The home was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was also added to the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties. Dating back to the 1880s, the home was built by architect William A. Lang and is said to be quite haunted.Many believe that one of the ghosts that lingers here is Molly Brown herself, and that her spirit has been seen wandering throughout the house, accompanied by cold spots. In some rooms of the house, pipe and cigar smoke can be smelled, and is attributed to her husband\'s ghost. There is also the ghost of a lady in Victorian clothing who likes to move the furniture around in the dining room. ""Johanna"" is the spirit that has been spotted in a bedroom upstairs and the ghost of a mad butler has been seen standing behind people as they go to look in a mirror on the first floor.3. Brown Palace Hotel - Denver, CO\xa0Photo by beauitfulcataya, via FlickrDenver\'s Brown Palace Hotel is located on 17th Street and dates back to 1892. The historic hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in April of 1970 and was also added to the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties. According to Wikipedia, it is the second-longest operating hotel in Denver and is one of the first atrium-style hotels ever built. The hotel is rumored to be haunted by a number of ghosts, one of them being a Denver socialite, Mrs. Louise Crawford Hill, who lived in Room 904 for 15 years. Her ghost is known to call the switchboard when the room is vacant, and only static can be heard on the other end.\xa0The ghost even called the switchboard from Room 904 when the room was being renovated and had no phone, furniture or lights.Another spirit of the hotel is an old-fashioned train conductor and in the dining room, there is a ghostly string quartet.\xa0When an employee caught the formally attired musicians playing in there, he warned them, “You’re not supposed to be in here,” but the ghosts only replied, “Oh, don’t worry about us. We live here.” A uniformed waiter that appears in the service elevator, a crying baby in the boiler room, and ghostly children who run up and down the halls are also among the ghosts of the Brown Palace Hotel.\xa04. Central City Masonic Cemetery - Black Hawk, COPhoto by tgidenver, via FlickrMost cemeteries are quite creepy to begin with, but The Central City Masonic Cemetery in Black Hawk is said to be a bit more eerie than others. The cemetery was established in the early 1860s and haunting reports include light anomalies and orbs that appear in photos, sightings of a young boy who is said to follow visitors around, but will run and hide if anyone tries to approach him, and there\'s also the Lady in Black. She is said to walk the cemetery every November 1st, visiting the grave of John Cameron, who many say had been her suitor in life.\xa05. St. Cloud Hotel - Canon City, COPhoto by Cowtools, via FlickrThe historic St. Cloud Hotel in Canon City is no longer in operation, but it is housed inside a building that originally dated back to 1890. It is one of the oldest hotels still standing in all of Colorado and was added to the National Register for ""Canon City Downtown Historic District."" A little girl\'s apparition has been spotted in the halls of the hotel, playing with a ball, and it is said that the other ghosts like to play tricks on both visitors and staff members. Other paranormal activity reports include televisions and lights that would turn on and off on their own, chairs would be found stacked inside rooms that weren\'t occupied, and objects would be mysteriously hidden.\xa06.

Stories say there is a ghost of a man wearing a hospital gown that lingers the grounds of the park at night, in search of his killers. He is said to have deep stab wounds in his chest, back and arms. Another strange report is from people who have claimed to experience an odd sensation if they lie down on the grass.\xa0They say that after lying down for a short time they feel as though they are unable to stand up. It is almost as though some unseen force is holding them down.7. Hotel Jerome - Aspen, COPhoto by Synthetichem, via FlickrAspen\'s Hotel Jerome dates back to 1889 and is located at the foot of Aspen Mountain. The luxury hotel is filled with historic heritage, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It was built by Jerome B. Wheeler, who was at the time, co-owner of Macy\'s and a major investor in Aspen. The establishment is believed to be haunted by a young boy who drowned in the hotel\'s swimming pool. His ghost is known to haunt Room 310, a room that overlooks the pool. He appears to guests wet and shivering and is said to disappear, leaving only a trail of wet footprints.\xa0Other ghosts that are said to haunt the hotel are Katie Kerrigan, a former employee of the hotel and Henry O\'Callister, a man who made a fortune in the mining industry. Legend says he moved to Jerome and fell in love with a Boston heiress named Clarissa Wellington. The two wanted to get married, but Clarissa\'s father refused to allow it. She returned to her father and Henry stayed in Aspen, and his ghost can be heard at night crying and wandering down the halls.8. Colorado Prison Museum - Canon City, COPhoto by Jeffrey Beall, via FlickrLocated off U.S. Highway 50 in Canon City, the Museum of Colorado Prisons is housed inside a former state women\'s prison. The prison building dated back to 1935 and the museum was founded in 1988 by a group of Fremont County residents. The property is believed to be haunted by some lingering spirits, who manifest as cold sots and a phantom tobacco smell that has been reported in the laundry room. And in Cell 19, a female prisoner who died there is said to have never left. Photos have shown ghostly orbs in the cell, and the sound of coughing has been heard coming from the empty cell.9. Imperial Hotel - Cripple Creek, COPhoto by Jasperdo, via FlickrCripple Creek\'s Imperial Hotel and Restaurant is a family-owned hotel that dates back to the late 1800s. Dr. Luigi is the ghost who is said to reside at the hotel, and he is known to make noise on the second floor. There is also the story of one of the original owners, George Long, and his daughter Alice. George married his first cousin, and Alice was born with a severe mental disorder and the couple locked her in the apartment next to the hotel because she became so unruly. One day, George ""fell"" down the stairs and died, although many believe Alice hit him with a skillet so he would fall.\xa0According to Visitcos.com, ""Today, Alice’s old room is the Red Rooster bar. Staff reports if the doors are closed, scratching can be heard on the other side. George’s ghost is a bit cheekier playing the slots at night when the casino is closed and touching lady guests at his leisure. The location was featured on an episode of Travel Channel’s Ghost Hunters.""10.\xa0Fitzsimons Army Hospital - Aurora, COPhoto by Tom, via WikiCommonsThis army hospital is no longer in operation but was once a U.S. Army facility located on 577 acres of land. The hospital opened in 1918 and was the largest structure in the state at the time. It closed its doors in 1999 and has since stood abandoned. It was founded during World War I by the U.S. Army after they needed to treat the large number of casualties from chemical weapons in Europe. The hauntings that have been reported here are believed to be attributed to its tragic past, and those lingering in spirit are most likely soldiers who passed away here.

where did the name orange county come from,"['Orange is a county in the state of California. As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,010,232 making it the third-most populated county in California, the sixth-most populated in the United States, and even more populated than twenty-one U.S. states. Its county seats in Santa Ana. It is the 2nd most populated county in the state, second only to San Francisco County. The county’s four biggest cities, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine, and Huntington Beach each have residents exceeding 200,000. Several of Orange County’s cities touch the Pacific coast, including Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and San Clemente. Orange County counts thirty-four incorporated cities; the newest is Aliso Viejo, incorporated in 2001. Anaheim was the first town, incorporated in 1870 when the area was still part of neighboring Los Angeles County. There is no designated urban center in Orange County. It is mostly suburban except for some traditionally urban areas at the hearts of the older cities of Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, Orange, and Santa Ana. There are several edge developments such as Irvine Business Center, South Coast Metro and Newport Center. The county is known for tourism with attractions like Knott’s Berry Farm, Disneyland, and several famous beaches adjacent its more than 40 miles (64 km) of coastline. It is part of the Tech Coast. Members of the Juaneño, Tongva, and Luiseño Native American groups long occupied the area. After the 1769 voyage of Gaspar de Portolà, a Spanish expedition led by Junipero Serra named the region Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne). On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano became the region’s first perpetual European settlement. Amongst those who came with Portolá were José Antonio Yorba and José Manuel Nieto. Both these obtained land grants—Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana and Rancho Los Nietos, respectively. The Nieto ranches, known as Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Las Bolsas, and Rancho Los Coyotes. Yorba inheritors Teodosio Yorba and Bernardo Yorba were also given Rancho Lomas de Santiago and Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana, respectively. The Mexican government granted other ranchos in Orange County during the Mexican period in Alta California. A severe drought in the 1860s crushed the regular industry, cattle ranching, and much land came into the ownership of Richard O’Neill, Sr., James Irvine and other land barons. In 1887, silver was discovered in the Santa Ana Mountains, attracting immigrants via the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads. This extension led the California legislature to divide Los Angeles County and create Orange County as a different political entity on March 11, 1889. The county is said, owes its name for the citrus fruit to promote immigration by suggesting a tropical paradise–a place where anything could grow. Other citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County profited from the July 4, 1904, completion of the Pacific Electric Railway, a trolley linking Los Angeles with Newport Beach and Santa Ana. The link made Orange County a convenient weekend escape for celebrities of early Hollywood. It was so important that Pacific City replaced its name with Huntington Beach in honor of Henry E. Huntington, chairman of the Pacific Electric and nephew of Collis Huntington. Transport further developed with the conclusion of the State Route and U.S. Route 101 (now mostly Interstate 5) in the 1920s. Agriculture, such as that comprising the boysenberries made famous by Buena Park native Walter Knott, began to decline after World War II. However, the county’s success soared during this time. The completion of Interstate 5 in 1954 helped make Orange County a bedroom neighborhood for many who settled in Southern California to work in aerospace and manufacturing. Orange County got a further lift in 1955 with the opening of Disneyland. In 1969, Yorba Linda saw Richard Nixon born in Orange County who became the 37th President of the United States. In the 1980s, Orange County became the second most populated county in California as the population surpassed two million for the first time. In 1994, an investment fund calamity led to the criminal prosecution of trustee Robert Citron. The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk purchases in bonds. The loss was imputed on derivatives by some media news. On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy, from which it emerged on June 12, 1996. The Orange County bankruptcy was at that moment, the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Recently, land use disputes have arisen between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts have issues such as the construction of new toll roads and the re-direction of a decommissioned air base. El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was assigned by a voter measure in 1994 to be expanded into an international airport to complement the current John Wayne Airport. However, voter initiatives and court actions caused the airport plan to be permanently suspended. Instead, it became the Orange County Great Park.', '']","This growth led the California legislature to divide Los Angeles County and create Orange County as a separate political entity on March 11, 1889. The county is said to have been named for the citrus fruit in an attempt to promote immigration by suggesting a semi-tropical paradise -- a place where anything could grow."

what is the full form of lg electronics,"[""The most common reason is when the original business has expanded. Either as part of a merger, acquisition, or simply as part of stellar growth plans that includes new product lines or service options. When this happens, the original brand name may no longer fit and a new or modified name is required. Of course, going back to the drawing board isn’t always the best option, particularly when there are years of equity invested in the name. However, if your brand name no longer reflects your business, take the time to consider what new name would appeal to your customer base and is reflective of your company. Research published in the\xa0Harvard Business Review\xa0highlights how getting it wrong can have catastrophic consequences. Accenture began as a division of Arthur Andersen. Following an acronymous split, the company Accenture was formed. The word “Accenture” is supposedly derived from the phrase “Accent on the future”. The name was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company’s Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates. LG Corp. was originally established as Rak-Hui (pronounced ‘Lucky’) Chemical Industrial Corp. As the company expanded, it established\xa0GoldStar\xa0Co. Ltd. Both companies, Lucky and GoldStar, merged and formed Lucky-GoldStar. In 1995, to compete better in the Western market, the Lucky-GoldStar Corporation was renamed “LG”. The company also associates the letters LG with the company’s tagline “Life’s Good”. Since 2009, LG has owned the\xa0domain name\xa0LG.com. 2. No Longer Accurate, or Limiting Companies that change names to be a better reflection of their current operation make up the second largest group of name changes. Such changes occur when businesses want consumers and investors to get a better idea of who they are and what they’re doing. When a name has a geographic reference in it that is no longer relevant or limiting, when the name references a partner who is no longer with the company, or to better reflect changes in consumer trends. When fried food fell out of favour, Kentucky Fried Chicken had to change their name to KFC. When Google needed to create a brand bigger than search – they changed their parent brand to Alphabet. A simpler name has many benefits. It’s easier to say and in some cases, can take up less space on social media commentary making it more likely to be used in full. When Citigroup changed its name to Citi it was trying to offer customers a more user-friendly, memorable name. One of its first orders of business was to rename the Mets ballpark to Citi Field. Renaming the company was an effort to create a brand name that could cover its myriad of interests, including Citi Smith Barney, Citi Investment Research and Citi Private Bank. ‘Citi’ is just easier. 4. U-Turn When companies, through natural progression or force of competitive pressure, become focussed on a new venture or change of direction, a brand name change is an excellent way of signalling change. More businesses than you might imagine started out as one thing, then evolved into something quite different. And, in order to be relevant to that new target audience, their old names had to go. Just ask Twitter – formerly Odeo, PayPal – formerly Confinity PDF Payments, Flickr – previously called Game Neverending or Pinterest formerly Tote. In some cases, a business group, with a number of companies under its umbrella might change their brand name to the one part of its group that’s the most successful – leveraging an iconic brand. This a good strategy that can bring some trust to the overall brand name, rather than just hoarding it for the one business. Brand leveraging is an important part of any company’s marketing strategy and thus,\xa0should be used when required.\xa0This was the winning strategy we adopted when changing our client’s name from AB Food and Beverages to\xa0Twinings & Co. The most effective names are often easy to remember and easy to pronounce. Many brands change or shorten their name to make them more appealing to consumers. This is the same strategy that led National Australia Bank to become NAB and America Online to become AOL. According to Al Ries, ‘A brand is what consumers call it.’ ‘Instead of trying to force-feed a nickname to consumers, a company needs to wait for them to popularize one. Coca-Cola, for example, didn’t put “Coke” on its bottles until after people began calling the product that.’ In some cases, when a company is ‘broken’ or wants to distance itself from a scandal or negative association, a new name can be a catalyst for positive change. But, this tactic comes with mixed results. What worked for ValuJet when they changed to AirTran Airways, failed miserably for\xa0Altria,\xa0previously Philip Morris. As you can see, there are numerous reasons as to why successful businesses and brands change their names. Changing a brand name can be one of the most challenging and daunting decisions a company can ever undertake. There are many challenges, but if you can overcome them, the results can surpass even the highest of expectations.
