Further volumes, published after the privatisation of HMSO or in the series about the Special Operations Executive, are also useful. The original works lacked references to unpublished sources when published before 1970. Government archives were opened to an extent by the Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1967. The works were published with only references to published sources. A number of official histories were produced by government departments. The authors worked under the same conditions and had the same access to official files but their works did not appear in the History of the Second World War.

As after the Great War, Canada did not issue a collected official history of the war, but commissioned a series of historical works that, taken together, enable readers to form a comprehensive picture. Owing to the magnitude of the German defeat, it took more than thirty years before the first official work on the Second World War was started. Originally planned as a ten-volume work, the expanding research necessitated the split of some volumes into two seperate books. Published by the historical section of the German Army, the Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt, the resulting work titled “Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg” progresses from a more operational outlook to a more inclusive viewpoint in later volumes, examining in detail the terrors war brought to Europe. The History of the Second World War is the official history of Britain’s contribution to the Second World War and was published by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO). The immense project was sub-divided into areas to ease publication. The History Office of the General Staff of the Italian Army (Stato Maggiore dell’esercito – Ufficio Storico) is responsible for official military history, and thus has published a series of monographs, illustrating various aspects of military history from Italy’s unification to the present. Of course the Second World War makes up a significant part of the available volumes. However, no official, complete italian history of the Second World War was eveeer written. The transcribed name of the official Japanese history of the Second World War is “Senshi Sosho”. Its a monumental work, covering virtually all aspects of the war except the Japanese war crimes. The Senshi Sosho totals 102 volumes that consist of 34 volumes on the Imperial General Headquarters, 37 volumes on the Army, 21 volumes on the Navy, nine volumes on the aerial war the Army and one volume of chronology. The fifty volume series covers all areas of New Zealand’s involvement in the Second World War, from detailed accounts of particular battalions, to the political and economic background and consequences, to full accounts of particular episodes and campaigns. The number of studies and books published by the US military on the Second World War alone fills a small library. Official histories do not only exist for the Army and the Navy, then the two arms of the US military, but also for the nascent forces of the Air Force and the Marines, and of course for countless other organisations like the Corps of Engineers or the Coast Guard.

where does the hogan stand get its name from,"['It is always a spectacular highlight of the Six Nations rugby union championship. Tomorrow\'s England vs Ireland international will also make history as an act of sporting reconciliation. The event is in danger of being overshadowed, however, by a dispute over the playing of God Save the Queen. For the first time the annual match is being staged at Dublin\'s Croke Park, the traditional home of gaelic games and the scene of an infamous massacre by British ""Black and Tan"" forces more than 80 years ago. The Irish team\'s home ground, Landsdowne Road in properous south Dublin, is in the process of being demolished to make way for a larger, more modern arena. So this season the game has been transferred to the city\'s only other major stadium, Croke Park, on the north side, which hosts Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) games. The GAA was founded in 1884 amid a surge of nationalist fervour aimed at promoting hurling and gaelic football in preference to English or ""foreign"" games. In 1918, in the run-up to the Irish war of independence, the organisation was even included in a list of organisations banned by the British government. Until five years ago, members of Northern Ireland\'s police force and the UK armed forces were barred from participating in GAA matches. The prospect of an English rugby team being greeted by an Irish army band performing God Save the Queen is still too much for some ardent GAA fans and hardline republicans. For them, Croke Park is doubly-hallowed ground because of what occurred there on November 21 1920. In what became known as the first Bloody Sunday, a detachment of ""Black and Tan"" police auxilaries - intent on extracting revenge for IRA attacks - opened fire on the crowds gathered to watch a GAA match. Fourteen spectators were killed and British control over Ireland was further undermined. Among those who died were Michael Hogan, a Tipperary player. The Hogan stand in Croke Park is named after him. Earlier this week J J Barrett, the son of a celebrated GAA player who won six all-Ireland final medals, announced he would withdraw his father\'s medal collection from the museum at Croke Park in protest at the decision to play the British national anthem this weekend. ""I cannot reconcile the provocative words of God Save The Queen being sung in the very stadium where Michael Hogan and others died at the hands of crown forces on Bloody Sunday,"" he wrote in a published letter. ""The words run contrary to our [GAA] constitution and I believe the GAA should have foreseen this problem when they rented out Croke Park and instead insisted on an England\'s Call type of musical prelude - the sort we are confined to now when we play away from home. Republican Sinn Féin, a dissident faction opposed to the peace process, is planning a protest near the ground objecting to the playing of the UK\'s national anthem. The police have stepped up security around the stadium. Yesterday the Archbishop of Cashel, Dermot Clifford, who is also a patron of the GAA, waded into the controversy by giving his blessing to the singing of God Save The Queen. ""As the Lansdowne Road stadium is being redeveloped, the GAA has allowed the IRFU to stage international rugby matches in Croke Park,"" he said. ""It is logical therefore that the protocols which apply to Landsdowne Road should also apply to Croke Park on Saturday."" The venue is politically sensitive. Earlier this month it was suggested that the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, might use the occasion to lay a wreath as an act of atonement for the 1920 massacre. Disapproval by unionists and concerns that it would confuse sport with politics to the detriment of both supposedly dissuaded him. Mr Hain later issued a statement declaring: ""I have never proposed doing anything other than attend and watch the match at the specific request of the Taoiseach and prime minister."" The issue has sparked a debate among media commentators in Dublin about residual Irish resentment of England. ""We are a sovereign nation with average per capita incomes above those of the UK,"" wrote Fintan O\'Toole in the Irish Times. ""There are probably no two countries in the world whose governments work more closely together than the Irish and British governments do. ""It is time we got over ourselves. The great thing about the arrival of the English rugby team in Croke Park is that it provides a precise, public, almost ritual occasion when we can ... be confident and at ease in situations where we used to feel Anglophobia."" Another commentator called for the removal of national anthems from sporting occasions on the grounds that they were inherently bombastic and jingoistic. ""Otherwise we are liable inadvertently to do more damage to Anglo-Irish relations than Jade Goody has done to Angl-Indian relations,"" he observed. The sky-high prices being charged for tickets on eBay demonstrates there is no likelihood of a boycott of the match. A pair of seats was recently offered for €2,400 (£1,600). The stadium\'s capacity is 82,300. One letter writer to an Irish paper pointed out that God Save the Queen had already been played at Croke Park in 2003 for the Special Olympics. There was no complaint then.']","The Hogan Stand at Croke Park, built in 1924, is named after Michael Hogan."

Most people don’t realize that plants are a vital asset to human life today. Sunlight plays a much larger role in our sustenance than we may expect: all the food we eat and all the fossil fuel we use is a product of photosynthesis, which is the process that converts energy in sunlight to chemical forms of energy that can be used by biological systems. Photosynthesis is carried out by many different organisms, ranging from plants to bacteria.\xa0 Virtually all oxygen in the atmosphere is thought to have been generated through the process of photosynthesis. Obviously, all respiring organisms (including plants) utilize this oxygen and produce CO2. Thus, photosynthesis and respiration are interlinked, with each process depending on the products of the other. The global amount of photosynthesis is on the order of a trillion kg of dry organic matter produced per day, and respiratory processes convert about the same amount of organic matter to CO2. A large part (probably the majority) of photosynthetic productivity occurs in open oceans, mostly by oxygenic prokaryotes. Without photosynthesis, the oxygen in the atmosphere would be depleted within several thousand years. It should be emphasized that plants respire just like any other higher organism, and that during the day this respiration is masked by a higher rate of photosynthesis. When I became a special education teacher, I wanted to be the type of teacher that provided opportunities for all students to learn. Becoming a teacher was exciting at first. I thought of all the good teachers I had when I was in school and all of the not so good experiences that I had when I was in school as well. I had a teacher that helped be gain a vast knowledge of science and I had another teacher that gave be a love for math which I still have today. But most of all, my teachers gave me the love to become a lifelong learner. I wanted to give my students that same passion, tenacity, and capability to become lifelong learners. I did not want to be a lecturer because students retain more information when they are engaged in meaningful hands on activities. Now that I am teacher, I realize that students are not the same type of students since I was in school several years ago. However, I still want my students to develop a true since of how learning takes place. In science, I provide students with many hands-on activities, guided notes and scaffolding learning groups. I have been working in the Special Education Field since 2007. I have been teaching in the Charlotte Mecklenburg School System for about one year. I teach a self- contained classroom at a school located in the inner city of Charlotte, NC. All of my students have some form of a disability, ranging from Autism to severe depression. Many of my students suffer from ADHD, so it is very hard for them to stay engaged for long periods of time. I teach at The Morgan School in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System, a large urban school district in North Carolina. The Morgan School is a public separate setting for students with behavioral and emotional disabilities. Our school embraces the philosophy that all students can learn new behaviors, new coping skills and master the North Carolina Standard Course of Study at the same time. Teachers are encouraged to use a variety of teaching techniques and strategies while meeting student’s individual needs. We have the freedom to modify the course content either through the process by which we deliver the content or through the recognition of our student’s individual readiness for the content that we are exploring. The school has approximately 100 students consisting of several different subgroups, including 81% African-American, 5% Hispanic, and 3% Multi-Racial, 1% Native American, and 10% White. Whether they are female, male, economically disadvantaged, non- economically disadvantaged, and all of our students have some form of a disability. According to Friend 2008, when a decision is reached for any type of separate education it is based on data about students academic and behavioral needs; educational placement changes are monitored carefully to ensure that the cost to the student of this decision is worth the benefit the student is receiving. Educational placement changes are reviewed and revised based on changing needs rather than rigidly scheduled for an entire school year; these changes are premised on the goal of reducing the separate service as soon as possible. My particular class this year consists of 8 students. I have a very unique group of students. One of the students has multiple disabilities ranging from autism to bipolar disorder. Another student has autism and turrets, while another student has mild- cerebral palsy and autism. The other five students have a variety of severe emotional disabilities. The class consists of all male students of which, 5 are African American males and 3 are Caucasian male students. All of the students in my class have Individualized Education Plans (IEP’s). An IEP is a document prepared by a multidisciplinary team or annual review team that specifies a student’s level of functioning and needs. IEP’s also focus on instructional goals and objectives for the student and how students will be evaluated in each target area. The nature and extent of special education, related services, and supplementary aids and services the student will receive; and the initiation date and duration of the services are all included in an IEP. Each student’s IEP is updated annually. IDEA (individuals with disabilities educational act) requires that every special education teacher monitor and report their students’ progress quarterly at least four times each year. Teaching students with disabilities can be challenging. An educator must use a wide variety of teaching techniques and strategies, to meet each students needs. Many of my students are years behind academically and it is hard for them to grasp new concepts easily. According to the North Carolina standard course of study, students must be able to analyze photosynthesis and cellular respiration in terms of how energy is stored, released and transferred within and between these systems. Our state standards indicate that 10th grade biology students must meet this requirement. Yet most students believe that photosynthesis is just the process by which plants receive food. According to Longman, cellular respiration is defined as the process by which food molecules are broken down to release energy. The study of cell origins primarily involves the question of how cells became individual units, separate from the external environment and capable of producing energy to sustain them. Cellular metabolism is the set of biochemical processes by which energy is either created or used in the cell, and energy resources in eukaryotic cells are regulated by two well-studied organelles: the mitochondrion and the chloroplast. Due to the widely held contention that these organelles once existed as separate organisms, the study of cell energy is inherently linked to the study of cell origins. All living organisms rely on cellular respiration to carry out all life functions so that their homeostasis is maintained. Photosynthesis can be defined as the process by which autotrophs convert sunlight to a usable form of energy. The first organism capable of photosynthesis reportedly evolved over 3 billion years ago. Today photosynthesis supports 99% of the life on Earth. “Sunlight plays a much larger role in our sustenance than we may expect: all the food we eat and all the fossil fuel we use is a product of photosynthesis, which is the process that converts energy in sunlight to chemical forms of energy that can be used by biological systems.”xi Photosynthesis is carried out by many different organisms, ranging from plants to bacteria. The best known form of photosynthesis is the one carried out by higher plants and algae, as well as by cyanobacteria and their relatives, which are responsible for a major part of photosynthesis in oceans. All these organisms convert CO2 (carbon dioxide) to organic material by reducing this gas to carbohydrates in a rather complex set of reactions. Electrons for this reduction reaction ultimately come from water, which is then converted to oxygen and protons. Energy for this process is provided by light, which is absorbed by pigments (primarily chlorophylls and carotenoids). Chlorophylls absorb blue and red light and carotenoids absorb blue-green light xii, but green and yellow light are not effectively absorbed by photosynthetic pigments in plants; therefore, light of these colors is either reflected by leaves or passes through the leaves. This is why plants are green. Virtually all oxygen in the atmosphere is thought to have been generated through the process of photosynthesis. Obviously, all respiring organisms (including plants) utilize this oxygen and produce CO2. Thus, photosynthesis and respiration are interlinked, with each process depending on the products of the other. The global amount of photosynthesis is on the order of a trillion kg of dry organic matter produced per day, and respiratory processes convert about the same amount of organic matter to CO2. A large part (probably the majority) of photosynthetic productivity occurs in open oceans, mostly by oxygenic prokaryotes. Without photosynthesis, the oxygen in the atmosphere would be depleted within several thousand years. It should be emphasized that plants respire just like any other higher organism, and that during the day this respiration is masked by a higher rate of photosynthesis. In this curriculum unit we will explore and analyze the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration and energy use in the cell. We also will analyze the overall reactions including the reactants and the products of photosynthesis and cellular respiration and factors which affect their rates (amounts of reactants, temperature, pH, light, etc.) Photosynthesis is an example of an endothermic chemical reaction, and cellular respiration in an example of an exothermic reaction. Chemical reactions that require energy are called endothermic reactions and a reaction that gives off, or releases energy is called exothermic reactions. Photosynthesis is considered an endothermic reaction because during photosynthesis plants use the energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. “The discovery of the process of photosynthesis was the sequential effort of two scientists Nicholas de Saussure, and C.B.Van Niel. In 1804 Swiss Chemist, Nicholas de Saussure discovered that plants placed in carbon dioxide- enriched air grew better than those in normal air. In the 1930’s C.B. Van Niel of Holland showed that light energy split water and released oxygen” viii. In the 1950’s the American Scientist R. Emerson determined that photosynthesis involves two stages. The first stage begins when light is absorbed in the grana of the chloroplast. The first stage is called the light dependent reactions stage. During the light-dependent reactions stage, water splits into Hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen (O2). In this stage light reactions are used to form a compound called ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate), whose chemical bonds have the ability to store energy and release energy when it needs to. These reactions occur in different areas of the thylakoid, named the photo-system I and the photo-system II. The photo-system is a light collecting unit for the chloroplast. The light dependent reactions require sunlight and water. In this stage a water molecule is in Photo-system II. Because the splitting of water release O2, Hydrogen ions (H+) and energized electrons (e–). Most of the O2 diffuses out of the plant and into the air that we breathe. The second stage follows the light dependent reactions. The products of the light-dependent reactions are NADPH and ATP, which are used in the Calvin Cycle. In 1905 English physiologist, F.F. Blackman discovered that the dark reactions go faster when the temperature is increased up to 30º, but they slow down at higher temperatures. He was able to conclude that these reactions are controlled by enzymes viii. ATP is used to build simple sugars from carbon dioxide. The chemical energy of the ATP molecule is used to build simple sugars from carbon dioxide. The chemical energy of the ATP molecule is transferred to the bonds that hold the sugar molecule together. ATP looses one of it three phosphates and is converted to adenosine di-phosphate. So where does cellular respiration come into the equation? Plants form food products using sunlight and carbon dioxide from the air. Oxygen allows animals to use the energy trapped inside this food. The oxygen that animals breathe in is used to burn the food to release the trapped energy. This process is called respiration. In respiration energy is released from the food materials, and carbon dioxide and water are given off. The process of cellular respiration is the exact opposite of the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis vs. Cellular Respiration Scientist for many years wondered what allowed plants to make their own food while humans could not make their own food. Was it their green color? In 1817 two French scientist, Pierre Joseph Peletier and Joseph Bienaime Caventou isolated the green substance from plants and they named it chlorophyll, from the Greek word meaning “green leaf”. In 1915 German Scientist Richard Willstatter won a Noble Peace Prize for his works with chlorophyll. Willstatter discovered that there were two different types of chlorophyll. One, which he named chlorophyll A, which makes up three fourths of the chlorophyll in plants and a second , chlorophyll B, which accounts for the other one fourth. Willstatter also found that chlorophyll contained carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms. CO2 + H2O + light energy (CH2O) + O2. Until the 1930’s when C.B. Van Niel questions this chemical reaction, Van Niel was investigating the photosynthesis that occurred in different groups of bacteria, such as purple sulfur bacteria viii. Purple sulfur bacteria create carbohydrates, but they do not release oxygen. Van Niel proposed that it was not carbon dioxide that is broken up to produce oxygen gas during photosynthesis, but the water molecule that is being broken up into hydrogen and oxygen. So the proper equation for photosynthesis in algae and green plants is 6 CO2 + 12 H2O C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O. When looking at this equation it is easy to notice that water appears on both sides of this equation and the total numbers of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms on the left side are equal to the corresponding sums on the right viii. Soil contains minerals and water that plants need to grow. The minerals that are located in soil dissolve in water, just as sugar or salt dissolves in water. The roots of a plant contain thousands of tiny root hairs. These tiny root hairs absorb most of the water that plants take in. The more root hairs a plants has, the greater the surface area available to absorb water viii. Stems consist of two types of transporting materials, Xylem and Phloem tubes. A xylem tube brings water and minerals from the roots to leaves. Phloem tubes carry food from the leaves to all parts of the plant viii. Leaves are made up of many parts. Leaves are usually wide and flat, this gives leaves are larger surface in order for them to absorb as much as possible. The more leaves a plant has, the more sunlight they can absorb. The top and the bottom layers protect the inside of the leaf. The top layer of a leaf is clear, so that it can absorb sunshine. Beneath the outer layer is a layer of food making cells viii. Stomates are tiny holes that allow Carbon Dioxide to pass through from the outsides of leaves. Stomates are surrounded by a pair of guard cells, when these guard cells are opened wide, gases can pass in and out of the stomates viii. Soil is the top layer of the earth’s crust in which organic matter grows. There are many components which determine a soil type such as pH, nutrient level and organic content. These factors can vary depending on the type of plant or crop which grows in the soil and also on geographic location. The best way to determine soil quality is by conducting a soil test. Photosynthesis is an amazing process. I chose to teach this unit to my students because photosynthesis is a complicated process for them to understand. I want my students to have a cast understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. This curriculum unit should be taught for three weeks. Our state standards requires that 10th grade biology students must be able to analyze photosynthesis and cellular respiration in terms of how energy is stored, released, and transferred within and between these systems. Yet most students believe that photosynthesis is just the process by which plants receive food. According to the North Carolina standard course of study, students must be able to analyze photosynthesis and cellular respiration in terms of how energy is stored, released and transferred within and between these systems.

Cornell note taking is a note taking system that was designed by Walter Paulk, a professor at Cornell University. Cornell notes are divided into three sections. The first section is the questions section, which is located on the left hand side of a sheet of notebook paper. The second section is the notes section, this is the section where students and write any notes that they have taken. Last but not least is the third section, titled the summary section xv. The summary section is used as a tool for students to summarize the entire day’s lesson. This is the time for students to focus on key ideas that were presented during the lesson. Students will use the Cornell Notes Handout, located in Appendix B . Vocabulary foldable is used for students to write the unit’s vocabulary and study the vocabulary when they need to review. A vocabulary foldable is used as a study tool for vocabulary words. Many students enjoy using a vocabulary foldable because they are easy to keep inside of their books or notebooks. There are two types of graphic organizers commonly used to compare different objects. A Venn- Diagram is used to compare two objects similarities to the objects differences. A Venn – Diagram provides students a visual display of the similarities and differences between two items. (Marzano) In this unit we will use a Venn-Diagram to compare cellular respiration to photosynthesis. As a warm up activity students will begin by completing a KWL chart. Students will brainstorm, K- what they know about photosynthesis and cellular respiration. W- what they want to know about photosynthesis and cellular respiration. L- what they have learned about photosynthesis and cellular respiration will be completed at the conclusion of this curriculum unit.(See Appendix B) Activity 1: Photosynthesis in Our World Today. As a warm up activity students will begin creating their first vocabulary foldable. The 1st vocabulary foldable will consist of the following vocabulary words: photosynthesis, autotrophy, chlorophyll, chloroplasts, light dependent reactions, ATP, cellular respiration, and glycolosis. After discussing with my class the process of photosynthesis and how cellular respiration is directly related to photosynthesis. My students will go to the website “http://www.science-class.net/Biology/Photosynthesis.htm“. WWW.scienceclass.net/Biology/Photosynthesis.htm where we are going to participate in several activities and quizzes as they relate to photosynthesis and cellular respiration. On this website, I want them to browse the link Slideshows: Photosynthesis & Respiration and Photosynthesis & Respiration Quizzes. One article found through this link details how food and breathing are related, because they are the two most important processes in all living organisms. The purpose of this activity is to assist my students in coming familiar with all of the chemical processes and their importance to photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Most of my students have no prior knowledge or concept of the chemical processes that take place during photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Over the next five days students will conduct a series of lab activities with a variety of plants. The purpose of these activities are to help students gain a vast understanding of all the chemical processes that are related to plant growth, respiration and how these process relate to our everyday lives. Plant from the geranium family. As a warm up activity students will begin by reading an article titled “ Endothermic Vs. Exothermic” http://w-chemicals.com/endothermic-vs-exothermic/ Students will read this article and complete a page of Cornell Notes .(See Appendix B) As an introduction to endothermic and exothermic reactions , I want to show my students two experiments that demonstrate endothermic and exothermic chemical reactions. The purpose of this activity is to assist my students in coming familiar with all of the chemical process of endothermic chemical reactions and exothermic chemical reactions. Photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction that occurs in plants, as they require external energy input within the form of sunlight or solar photons. Cellular respiration is an exothermic reaction by which the chemical energy of “food” molecules is released and partially captured in the form of ATP. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used as fuels in cellular respiration, but glucose is most commonly used as an example to examine the reactions and pathways involved IV. 1. In a pitcher or large measuring cup, stir together the whipping cream, half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla extract until sugar has dissolved. 2. Pour about 1/2 cup of mixture into a pint-size plastic bag and seal carefully, squeezing out extra air. Place each sealed bag into a second pint-size bag, again squeezing out extra air. Seal carefully. 3. Fill each gallon-size plastic bag about halfway with ice and add 1/2 cup coarse salt. Place one sealed small bag into the large bag, squeeze out most of the air, and seal the large bag. 4. Wear mittens or thick gloves, or wrap the bag in a towel to protect hands against the extreme cold. Shake and massage the bag for about 5 minutes or until mixture thickens into ice cream. Add more salt and ice to the outer bag if ice cream hasn’t formed after 10 minutes of continuous motion. 5. Remove the outer pint-size bag before you open the inner bag so you don’t get any of the salty ice on your ice cream. As a warm up activity students will begin by reading an article titled “Why do leaves change colors?” http://www.esf.edu/pubprog/brochure/leaves/leaves.htm Students will read this article and complete a page of Cornell Notes. (See Appendix B) As an introduction to teaching students why leaves change colors. I want to show my students an experiment that demonstrates why leaves change colors and the chemical processes that are involved. The purpose of this activity is to assist my students in coming familiar with all of the chemical process involved with photosynthesis and cellular respiration. When leaves appear green, it is because they contain an abundance of chlorophyll. There is so much chlorophyll in an active leaf that the green masks other pigment colors. Light regulates chlorophyll production, so as autumn days grow shorter, less chlorophyll is produced. The decomposition rate of chlorophyll remains constant, so the green color starts to fade from leaves xiii. As a warm up activity students will begin by completing a KWL chart. Students will brainstorm, K- what they know about soil pH. W- what they want to know about soil pH. L- what they have learned about soil pH will be completed at the conclusion of this activity.(See Appendix B) As an introduction to the concept of soil pH, I want my students to read and create a presentation on soil pH. Students will read the following article: http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/167187/soil-ph.pdf. This article offers a great explanation of soil acidity and how it affects plant growth. This lab can be found on the following webpage: http://www.bgci.org/files/Canada/english_docs/rbg_soilph.pdf 1. For this experiment, you will need a number of soil samples collected from locations in which different plant species are growing. For example, you may collect soil samples from under a pine tree, a maple tree, a spruce tree, a tomato plant, a radish, an azalea bush, clover, or goldenrod. When collecting your samples, you will want to ensure that soils collected from under a wide variety of plants species are represented. 2. You may collect these soil samples on your own ahead of time or you may choose to take your students on a soil gathering expedition around the school (this could be incorporated into a plant identification hike). You may also choose to assign this as a homework project, requesting that students bring in soil samples from home (you will want to encourage them to only gather soil from under plants that they can positively identify). 3. To collect your soil samples, use a trowel to dig down 10-15 cm into the soil (harming the plant as little as possible in the process). Place a soil sample into a small plastic bag or container. Label the container with the name of the plant using masking tape and a marker. Fill in the hole you have made as best you can. This lesson works best as a small group activity. 1. Provide each group with one soil sample, a couple pieces of red and blue litmus paper, an eyedropper and two petri dishes. 2. Review with your students what litmus paper is for and how to read the results from this pH indicator. 3. Instruct the students to place a piece of blue litmus paper in one petri dish and a piece of red litmus paper in the other petri dish. The students should then place approximately a ½ teaspoon of their soil sample on top of each strip. Using the eyedropper, the students should then moisten the soil until the strips of litmus paper become wet. Finally, instruct the students to brush the soil away. Is their soil acidic or basic? 4. Have your students construct a table in their notebooks consisting of two columns titled Acidic Soil and Alkaline Soil. In the appropriate column, the students should record the name of the plant species under which their soil was found. 5. Instruct each student or group to display their soil sample (with the plant species name clearly visible) and the results of the litmus paper tests in their work area. Allow the students to circulate throughout the room, recording the findings for each soil sample. . From Discovery Education.

[xv] This website offers a good explanation of Cornell note taking.', '', ""Recently, I wrote about how I learned to carry a notebook early in my career, and provided some insight into how I took notes. Most people think that taking notes is simple, easy—something that does not require a lot of thought. Theories abound. Opinionated as I am, I think it is simply because we do not teach people how to take notes. Think about it - do you remember being taught how to take notes in school? If you went to Cornell, you may have been exposed to the Cornell System, a note-taking process developed by Professor of Education Walter Pauk at Cornell in the 1950s. I remember my seventh-grade biology teacher commenting that I used the Cornell system when he saw some of my notes in a class. I had no idea what he was talking about at the time—I was taking notes the way I always had, going back to the fifth grade. My goal here is not to teach you how to take notes. We can cover that later, because the way you take notes will depend on the situation. Your methods have to be different because your needs are different. What works in a classroom will not work in the field, or on the warehouse floor. What works for an interview does not work for observations of floor activities. Instead, my goal here is to get you to understand why, as a supervisor or as a leader, you should take notes. Come on. Be honest. That has happened to all of us. One of the most important reasons why I take notes in meetings, in person or on the phone, is that I am less likely to check out of the meeting that way. I write down key words, key points, and who said what. I write down things that I have to verify, because someone always says something that is not quite true. A colleague of mine records the emotions in the room, including his own. If you were to read any of our notes right after a meeting, you would not be able to make sense of them. That is by design. My colleague always revises his notes, creating a deeper version of them. I create a list of actions to take, which I indicate with nothing more than a few marks and arrows. The act of actively listening and taking note of the key points made by everyone present is enough to keep me engaged in the meeting, enabling me to maintain a full presence in the room. I know that it is the same for most people, based on years of observing people in meetings. The ones who have the pad of paper in front of them and nothing on the page at the end of the meeting were not too busy in the meeting to take notes; they were too busy in their own heads to be present at that meeting. Taking notes in a meeting, or in a phone call, ramps up the activity in your brain and forces you to engage at a higher level so that you don’t mentally check out. Notice something that I said above: “based on years of observing people in meetings.” When you take notes, you are communicating to everyone else in the room that you are actively listening. The act of writing down what you hear shows respect to the others in the room, and increases their respect for you. Remember that my managers at the store noticed me because I took notes when nobody else did. People notice when you take notes. How often do you think? Do you have a special place where you do your thinking? Winnie the Pooh had his thinking spot. We all have a place where we do our thinking. When I sit down to think, I always do so with a pad of paper in front of me. I use a variety of different pads and tools for my thinking. Sometimes I use my planning grid. Sometimes a large sheet of paper that I can draw diagrams on. Sometimes a pad of sticky notes. Sometimes it is my little pocket notebook. If I am thinking, a pencil (or pen) and a sheet of paper is not far from my hand. I remember an old friend, Frank, teasing me one day about forgetting a great idea. I was young, perhaps twelve years old, and he was in his sixties, so he was truly an old friend. I had this great idea for reversing a music tape when it got to the end. I had thought out all the details. I was so excited about telling Frank about my idea. Except when I went to tell him, I forgot half the design I had dreamed up. That was when my old friend shared some wisdom with me: “Ideas are like flies, flitting around. If you don't smack them with the paper, they fly away!” Frank Birdsall was the retired president of a major hotel chain. He was a smart executive. I honor him for planting in my mind the image of smacking an idea with a piece of paper. We all have “To-Do” lists. These are nothing but task lists. Have you ever thought about writing down the one major objective you want to achieve? I am not talking about things like “getting the grass mowed.” I am talking about things like “creating an investment strategy” or “creating next year’s sales plan.” Tony Robbins teaches that until you make the effort to write down all the “things” you have to do that are flying around in your mind, you never get to the things you want to do. As Robbins puts it, the things that you have to do keep circling around in your head until you don’t know where to start or where the end is. Robbins teaches us to capture all these tasks by putting them on paper, enabling you to prioritize them, consolidate them, and then get them done. Clearing out all these “things” helps get you organized. It helps you to create more space in your head, because as you capture the “gotta-dos” on paper, you start to plan how you are going to deal with them. That action helps calm most people (it does me), and it opens your mind so you can question the purpose of these “gotta-dos.” One of the benefits of identifying their purpose is that you build motivation and momentum to get them done. Another benefit is that you sometimes identify things that are not very important and can be discarded. Going through this process for a few weeks starts to clear the mind of the little things. You start to think about the bigger things, the real accomplishments that you want to get done. The act of organizing the things that need to be done and making a plan of action to get them done is a powerful management skill. It is one that many will say is easy to understand, but so few do because they fail to take the first step—to write the “gotta-dos” down on paper.

AdventThe word\xa0Advent\xa0means “coming.” It is a time to slow down, be quiet and meditate\xa0about the real meaning of Christmas. These four weeks before Christmas are a\xa0time to prepare our hearts and our lives as we wait for the coming of Jesus. We\xa0focus on the promise that God made to his people and how that promise was\xa0fulfilled in Jesus. ChristmasChristmas Day is one of the seven principal feasts. The Christmas season lasts twelve days, from Christmas Day through January 5. The season includes Christmas Day, the First Sunday after Christmas Day, the Holy Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and may include the Second Sunday after Christmas Day. In many parishes, the main liturgical celebrations of Christmas take place on Christmas Eve. EpiphanyThe third season of the church year is Epiphany. The word means making God manifest. It is the church's response to God's Christmas. The primary theme is Baptism, beginning with the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord. A similar idea is reflected with the response of the magi who journeyed far to worship Jesus at Bethlehem.Epiphany Resources LentThe season begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on the Saturday before Easter (Holy Saturday.) The period of Lent covers 40 days excluding Sundays since every Sunday is a “little Easter.” We are reminded of Jesus’ forty days spent in the wilderness and the temptation by Satan before Jesus began his ministry.Lent Curriculum\xa0Curriculum ResourcesLent Resources EasterEaster Day is the annual feast of the resurrection, the Pascha or Christian Passover.

(Remember to click on the blue headline to see the whole page if you are seeing this on your email.) I had great difficulty getting photographs of some of the windows on the days I visited this church. In some cases, very little light was coming through or shadows were blocking out important parts of the window imagery. I intend to return and hope to be able to improve some of these images. I hope you enjoy what I am able to present here. Often you will see a large image of the entire window (or most of it) and one or two more detailed images from these beautiful and inspired stained-glass creations. In 1878 missionary Redemptorist priests settled between the frontier towns of Westport and Kansas City and, after building a mission house for the Redemptorist priests, brothers, and seminarians, they traveled throughout the newly settled towns of the Midwest preaching sermons.\xa0 Neighboring Catholics soon began worshiping with the priests and brothers at the mission house chapel, and in 1888 the parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help was established. Local people were so accustomed to calling their chapel Redemptorist, that the popular name has prevailed even to\xa0the present day. Within a few years the congregation outgrew the missionary chapel. In 1893 the parishioners built a Gothic style church seating 400 people. Within fifteen years that church could not accommodate the influx of people settling between Westport and Kansas City, and the architecture firm of Wilder and Wight was hired to design a much larger French Gothic church. Ground was broken for the new church on June 21, 1908, and the Church was dedicated on May 12, 1912. The original Sanctuary windows, depicting various Marian themes, were installed in 1915. Between 1925 and 1828 twenty more Bavarian Memorial art glass windows were placed in the nave and two in the clerestory above the transept altars. \xa0These windows were created by the Emil Frei Fine Art Glass Company of Munich and St. Louis. The angel windows that line the rest of the clerestory were added in the 1940’s and were also created by the Emil Frei Fine Art Glass Company of St. Louis. (For more about the Emil Frei Fine Art Glass Company, follow the link to their informative web site.) Christ, accompanied by\xa0God the Father\xa0and the\xa0Holy Spirit\xa0in the form of a dove, places a crown on the head of\xa0Mary\xa0as\xa0the Queen of Heaven. (Rev 12:1) The Crowning of Mary is the fifth\xa0Glorious Mystery\xa0of the Rosary and is celebrated in the Roman Catholic Church every August 22. Scriptural sources are a bit confusing regarding the identities of the Three Marys at the Foot of the Cross. John (19:25) identifies them as Mary, Jesus’ mother; Mary Magdalene, who was healed by Jesus, then supported His ministry, and was the first person to see Him after His resurrection; and Mary the wife of Clopas (Cleophas), who was the sister of Jesus’ mother (and the mother of James the less and Joses). The Crucifixion (Matt 27:33-56) is the fifth Sorrowful Mystery of the Rosary. The transformation of\xa0water\xa0into\xa0wine\xa0at the\xa0Wedding Feast of Cana\xa0is the first\xa0miracle attributed to Jesus\xa0in the\xa0Gospel of John. (John 2:1-12) In the Gospel account,\xa0Jesus,\xa0his mother\xa0and his\xa0disciples\xa0are invited to a wedding, and when the wine runs out, Jesus delivers a sign of his\xa0glory\xa0by turning water into wine. In the center of this window we see the\xa0Blessed Virgin Mary\xa0as represented in a celebrated 15th-century\xa0Byzantine icon that has been in\xa0Rome\xa0since 1499, and is permanently enshrined in the\xa0church of Saint’ Alfonso di Liguori. The\xa0Redemptorist\xa0Priests, were appointed as both\xa0custodians\xa0and missionaries of this icon by\xa0Pope Pius IX\xa0in 1865. Here, as in the miraculous icon, the Virgin Mary, under the title “Mother of God,” holds the Child Jesus. The Archangels Michael and Gabriel, hovering on either side of them, hold the instruments of the Passion. St. Michael (on the left) holds the spear, the wine-soaked sponge, and the crown of thorns. St. Gabriel (on the right) holds the cross and the nails. The Child Jesus seeks comfort from His mother as He sees the instruments of His passion.\xa0 Surrounding the central image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help are angels. Three Magi, represented as kings, having found Jesus by following a\xa0star, lay before him gifts of\xa0gold,\xa0frankincense, and\xa0myrrh and worship him.\xa0 (Matthew 2:1-22) The arrival of the Magi is an important part of the Nativity narrative and is celebrated as the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6th. The Birth of Jesus is the third Joyful Mystery of the Rosary. The\xa0angel\xa0Gabriel\xa0 announces to the\xa0Virgin Mary\xa0that she will conceive\xa0and become the mother of\xa0Jesus, the\xa0Son of God, marking his\xa0Incarnation. The angel Gabriel says Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you… \xa0Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. (Luke 1:26-38) The Annunciation is the first Joyful Mystery of the Rosary. Adam and Eve,\xa0having eaten\xa0from the\xa0tree of knowledge which God had forbidden, became ashamed of their nakedness. Subsequently, God banishes them from the Garden of Eden, condemning Adam to work in order to get what he needs to live, and Eve to giving birth in pain. (Gen 3:1-21) South Side –Lower Windows\xa0(Starting at St. Alphonsus Altar) Redemptorist Saints—St. Alphonsus Liguori, St. Clement Hofbauer, and St. Gerard Majella This window represents the Redemptorist Saints at the time the window was created. (A later window featuring St. John Neumann is located over the west entrance. In 1977 Neumann was the first U.S. Bishop and second U.S. citizen to be canonized.) At the left, an angel holds St. Alphonsus’ metre as the bishop kneels before the monstrance holding the Blessed Sacrament. To the right are two other Redemptorist saints, St. Clement Hofbauer and St. Gerard Majella. At the top of the window, two angels carry Our Lady of Perpetual Help as a gift from heaven to the Redemptorists. They that explain me shall have everlasting life. Eccl. 25:31 The\xa0Visitation\xa0is the visit of\xa0Mary\xa0to\xa0Elizabeth\xa0as recorded in the\xa0Gospel of Luke. (Luke 1:39–56.) Mary was pregnant with\xa0Jesus\xa0and Elizabeth with\xa0John the Baptist. John, still in the womb, became aware of the presence of Christ and leapt for joy. Elizabeth, recognizing the presence of Jesus. said, “Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.” In response to Elizabeth, Mary proclaimed the\xa0Magnificat\xa0(My soul doth magnify the Lord). The Visitation is the second\xa0Joyful Mystery\xa0of the\xa0Rosary. The\xa0Magnificat\xa0is one of the eight most ancient Christian\xa0hymns\xa0and perhaps the earliest\xa0Marian hymn. Joseph, with his flowering staff, and the Virgin Mary stand in the Temple before the high priest. According to The Golden Legend, several men besides Joseph wanted Mary’s hand in marriage. Each was instructed to place a staff on an altar. The staff that Joseph brought miraculously burst into leaf, a sign that he was God’s choice to be Mary’s husband. For Joseph, this wedding is more than just the taking of a wife: it is an act of protection for Mary and her unborn Child. Just as Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is honored by Catholics as the Mother of the Church, so St. Joseph, the Guardian of Jesus, is honored as the Church’s Protector. His feast is celebrated on March 19. As a fair olive tree in the plain and as a plain by the water in the street was I exalted. Ecc. 24:19 [Book of Sirach 24:14] Mary\xa0and\xa0Joseph\xa0took the\xa0Infant Jesus\xa0to the\xa0Temple\xa0in\xa0Jerusalem\xa0forty days after his birth to complete Mary’s\xa0ritual purification\xa0after childbirth, and to perform the\xa0redemption of the firstborn son. (Luke 2:22–40)\xa0They encountered\xa0Simeon, who \xa0had been promised that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s\xa0Christ. Simeon then uttered the prayer that would become known as the\xa0Nunc Dimittis, which prophesied the\xa0redemption\xa0of the world by Jesus . The elderly\xa0prophetess\xa0Anna\xa0was also in the Temple, and offered prayers and praise to God for Jesus, speaking of His importance to redemption in Jerusalem. Anna may be the woman standing next to Joseph in this window. The Presentation is the fourth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary. And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse. Isiah 11:1 The\xa0Last Supper\xa0is the final meal that Jesus\xa0shared with his\xa0Apostles\xa0in\xa0Jerusalem\xa0before\xa0his crucifixion. The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the\xa0Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread, breaks it, and gives it to the Apostles, saying\xa0 “This is my body given to you.” The Gospel of John does not include this episode, but tells of Jesus\xa0washing the feet of the Apostles, giving\xa0the new commandment “to love one another as I have loved you.”\xa0 During the meal\xa0Jesus predicts his betrayal\xa0by one of the Apostles present, and foretells that before the next morning,\xa0Peter\xa0will\xa0deny knowing him. The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is the fifth Luminous Mystery of the Rosary. Take ye and eat. This is my body. Matt 16:20 In memory of Mary E. Curry Parsons The\xa0Transfiguration of Jesus\xa0recalls the moment when\xa0Jesus\xa0is\xa0transfigured\xa0 in radiant\xa0glory\xa0upon a mountain.\xa0(Matthew 17:1–8,\xa0Mark 9:2–8,\xa0Luke 9:28–36) Jesus and three of his apostles,\xa0Peter,\xa0James,\xa0John, have gone \xa0to a mountain to pray when Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of light. Then the prophets\xa0Moses\xa0and\xa0Elijah\xa0appear next to him and he speaks with them. Jesus is then called “Son” by a voice in the sky, assumed to be\xa0God the Father, as in the\xa0Baptism of Jesus. The Transfiguration acts as a further revelation of the identity of Jesus as the\xa0Son of God\xa0to some of his disciples. It is a pivotal moment where human nature meets God: the meeting place for the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus himself as the connecting point, acting as the bridge between heaven and earth. The Transfiguration not only supports the identity of Jesus as the\xa0Son of God\xa0 but, identifies him as the messenger and mouth-piece of God. The Transfiguration is the fourth Luminous Mystery of the Rosary. This is my beloved son. Hear ye Him. Matth 17:6 In memory of Mary E. Curry Parsons The\xa0Sermon on the Mount\xa0is found in the\xa0Gospel of Matthew\xa0(Chapters\xa05,\xa06, and\xa07) and is a collection of sayings and teachings of\xa0Jesus which emphasizes his\xa0moral teaching. It takes place relatively early in his ministry, after he has been\xa0baptized\xa0by\xa0John the Baptist\xa0and preached in\xa0Galilee.\xa0It includes some of the best known teachings of Jesus, such as the\xa0Beatitudes, and the widely recited\xa0Lord’s Prayer. The Sermon on the Mount is generally considered to contain the central tenets of\xa0Christian discipleship. Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. Matth 5:3 In memory of Mary E. Curry Parsons The\xa0Temptation of Christ in the Desert\xa0is detailed in the Gospels of\xa0Matthew, \xa0Mark and\xa0Luke. After being\xa0baptized\xa0by\xa0John the Baptist,\xa0Jesus\xa0fasted\xa0for forty days and nights in the\xa0Judaean Desert. During this time,\xa0Satan\xa0appeared to Jesus and tried to tempt him. (Make bread out of stones to relieve his hunger; Jump from a pinnacle and rely on angels to break his fall; Worship the devil in return for all the kingdoms of the world.) Then Jesus said Begone, Satan: for it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.\xa0(Matthew 4:10) Having refused each temptation, the Devil then departed, and Jesus returned to\xa0Galilee\xa0to begin his ministry. In this window we see Jesus banishing Satan and we see the angels who have come to minister to him. Thou shalt adore the Lord, Thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. Luke 4:8 In memory of Mary E. Curry Parsons The\xa0Baptism of Jesus,\xa0 described in the\xa0Gospels\xa0of\xa0Matthew,\xa0Mark\xa0and\xa0Luke, is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being the\xa0Transfiguration,\xa0Crucifixion,\xa0Resurrection, and\xa0Ascension. It is generally considered as the start of\xa0his ministry.\xa0 In this scene, John the Baptist is baptizing Jesus and the Holy Spirit is descending as a dove from heaven. A voice is heard with the words Behold this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.(Matthew 3:13–17; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–23) The Baptism of Jesus is the first Luminous Mystery of the Rosary. In memory of Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Zahner and Family Our Lady of Sorrows\xa0is one of the names by which the\xa0Virgin Mary\xa0is referred to in relation to sorrows in her life. As\xa0Mater Dolorosa, it is also a key subject for\xa0Marian art in the Catholic Church. The Seven Sorrows of Mary are a popular\xa0Roman Catholic devotion. In common religious Catholic imagery, the Virgin Mary is portrayed in a sorrowful and lacrimating affect, with seven long knives or daggers piercing her heart. Devotional prayers elaborate on Seven Sorrows (Dolors) in her life.\xa0 These are: The Prophecy of Simeon. (Luke\xa02:34–35); The Escape and\xa0Flight into Egypt. (Matthew\xa02:13); The Loss of the\xa0Child Jesus\xa0in the Temple of Jerusalem. (Luke 2:43–45); The Meeting of Mary and Jesus on the\xa0Via Dolorosa; The Crucifixion of Jesus\xa0on Mount Calvary. (John\xa019:25); The Piercing of the Side of Jesus with a spear, and His\xa0Descent from the Cross. (Matthew 27:57–59); and The\xa0Burial of Jesus\xa0by\xa0Joseph of Arimathea. (John 19:40–42). Window above the West Entry of the Church:\xa0St. John Neumann, Fourth Redemptorist Saint St. John Neumann The circular window above the choir loft was designed by John T. Murphy when the\xa0 Redemptorist Church was designated as a diocesan shrine to the Redemptorist saint. Constructed by Hopcroft Art and Stained Glass Works, it was installed in 1977, the year Neumann became the second U.S. citizen to be canonized. (June 19, 1977) He was Bishop of Philadelphia from 1852 to 1860 and built over 50 churches in his lifetime, so it is fitting that the window contains an image of Redemptorist Church–with the addition of a steeple that was never finished.\xa0 St. John Nep (omucene) Neumann CSSR –1811-1860 St. John Neumann (detail) North Side Lower Windows (Starting at St. Joseph’s Altar) The Death of St. Joseph, Patron of a Happy Death Death of St. Joseph When Jesus began His public ministry, Mary was with Him, but Joseph was not. Tradition holds that Jesus and Mary were with Joseph when he died, and thus he is invoked as the Patron of a Happy Death. Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. Apoc [Revelation] 14:13 Jesus said, Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. (Mark 10:14) Apparition of Sacred Heart of Jesus to St. Margret Mary Alacoque St.\xa0Margaret Mary Alacoque,\xa0V.H.M.\xa0 (1647–1690), was a\xa0French\xa0Roman Catholic\xa0nun\xa0and\xa0mystic, who promoted\xa0devotion\xa0to the\xa0Sacred Heart of Jesus\xa0in its modern form. \xa0The devotion to the\xa0Sacred Heart\xa0 is one of the most widely practiced and well-known\xa0Roman Catholic devotions, taking\xa0Jesus Christ′s\xa0physical heart as the representation of his divine love for humanity. Saint\xa0Margaret Mary Alacoque said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions\xa0to her between 1673 and 1675. Behold this Heart which has so loved me. The Sacred Heart of Jesus is often depicted in\xa0Christian art\xa0as a flaming heart\xa0shining with divine light, pierced by the lance-wound, encircled by the\xa0crown of thorns, surmounted by a cross, and bleeding. Here we see the Sacred Heart shining within the bosom of Christ, and his wounded hands. The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of\xa0Jesus’ death, while the fire represents the transformative power of divine love. Historically the devotion to the Sacred Heart is an outgrowth of devotion to what is believed to be Christ’s sacred humanity. Most Sacred Heart of Jesus have mercy on us. The\xa0Resurrection of Christ\xa0is the Christian\xa0religious belief\xa0that, after being\xa0put to death,\xa0Jesus\xa0rose again\xa0from the dead. It is the central tenet of\xa0Christian theology and part of the\xa0Nicene Creed. According to the\xa0New Testament, after the Romans crucified Jesus, he was\xa0anointed and buried in a new tomb\xa0by\xa0Joseph of Arimathea. But God raised him from the dead and he\xa0appeared to witnesses\xa0before he\xa0ascended into heaven, to\xa0sit\xa0at the\xa0right hand of God.\xa0 Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus on\xa0Easter Sunday, two days after\xa0Good Friday, the day of\xa0his crucifixion.\xa0 The Resurrection (John 20:1-29) is the first Glorious Mystery of the Rosary. I am the Resurrection and the Life. John 11:25 In Memory of Father John McGeough CSS by Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Carey The Roman Catholic Church traces the beginnings of the papacy to Jesus’ appointment of Peter as head of the Church. Here Peter, who was previously named Simon, receives his new name from Jesus and is commissioned to be the rock of the Church as Jesus hands him the keys of the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 16:17-19 and John 21:15-17) In Memory of Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Grier The\xa0Ascension of the Lord window depicts the departure of\xa0Christ\xa0from Earth into the presence of\xa0God. The narrative (Luke 24:36-53; Acts 1:9-11) \xa0takes place 40 days after the\xa0Resurrection. \xa0In the company of the disciples. Jesus is taken up in their sight after warning them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the\xa0Holy Spirit. \xa0As he ascends, a cloud hides him from their view, and two men in white appear to tell them that he will return. The\xa0Feast of the Ascension\xa0is celebrated on the 40th day of\xa0Easter, always a Thursday. The Ascension is the second Glorious Mystery of the Rosary. While they looked on, He was raised up. Acts 1:9 Pray for Mrs. Jozach Miller and Daughter Mary The Christian holiday of\xa0Pentecost, which is celebrated on the seventh Sunday (49 days) after\xa0Easter, commemorates the descent of the\xa0Holy Spirit\xa0upon the\xa0Apostles and other followers of\xa0Jesus Christ\xa0while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the\xa0Feast of Weeks. About one hundred and twenty followers of Christ\xa0 were present, including the Twelve Apostles (Matthias\xa0was\xa0Judas’ replacement) Jesus’ mother, Mary, other female disciples and others. Christians believe this event represents the birth of the Church. The descent of the Holy Spirit on the Virgin Mary and the Apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-41) is the third Glorious Mystery of the Rosary. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:4 Pray for Father Alex Chapoton and the deceased Redemptorist Fathers. Christ the King\xa0is a title of\xa0Jesus \xa0where the Christ is described as\xa0seated\xa0at the\xa0Right Hand of the Father in Heaven. The liturgical year ends with the feast of Christ the King. And behold there was a throne set in Heaven and upon the Throne one sitting. Apoc. [Revelation] 4:2 Pray for Dr. F. J. Iuen and Family (Ecce Homo) are the\xa0Latin\xa0words used by\xa0Pontius Pilate\xa0in the\xa0Vulgate\xa0translation of\xa0John\xa019:5, when he presents a\xa0scourged Jesus Christ, bound and\xa0crowned with thorns, to a hostile crowd shortly before\xa0his Crucifixion. Twenty-two clerestory angel windows along both sides of the nave were installed in the 1940’s. This ends our tour of the beautiful stained-glass windows in Our Lady of Perpetual Help Redemptorist Catholic Church in mid-town Kansas City, Missouri. This parish and the people who have worshiped here have played an important part in the history and life of our community. I hope this “journey” has given you a deeper appreciation of this beautiful and impressive church and the windows which contribute so much to its spiritual mission. As always, please let me know if you find errors or omissions in my documentation. I am always interested in your thoughts and responses to what I have shared with you. Remember, if you click on the “FOLLOW” button, you will always be notified whenever I post a new blog entry. Lots of helpful information here to assist our understanding of the art. I have a question- some of the windows were installed later… what was there before the windows? Just clear glass? yes. lots of windows are often just clear or colored glass and then the new windows are installed later. Bruce, what awesome photos. You really captured the beauty of the stained glass windows at this magnificent church! Thanks, Gini. I hoped you would like it. How is the back? I always enjoy reading your posts. The history of the church is fascinating, and the windows are incredible.

It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles. Some Christians believe that this event represents the birth of the Church. The Feast of the Ascension occurs 40 days after Easter, so Pentecost is a moveable feast. In Eastern Christianity, Pentecost can also refer to the entire 50 days between Easter and the feast, and the book containing the liturgical texts for the period is called the Pentecostarion."
how long has there been land plants on earth,"['', 'Creation Days Not the Same as 24-hour Earth Days: Click here for the third part of this blog. Getting our parameters right begins with knowing beginnings, but more than that is being able to distinguish one beginning from the other. Most think that Day 1 of Creation is also Day 1 on Earth. The Bible explains that these two differ. It is on the fourth day of creation that the first earth day commenced. GENESIS 1:16-19 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. The doubt that we have to solve is how vegetation could exist when the sun was made to bring light unto the earth only on the fourth day. It is scientific knowledge that vegetation can exist for some time without the light of the sun upon which plants depend to produce their food by the process of photosynthesis. We must remember that it was on the third day of creation that God caused the appearing of dry land from the globe of waters, after which He caused vegetation to appear. GENESIS 1:9-13 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. From these accounts, we understand that two great parts of creation happened on the third day: the appearing of the ground or the dry land, afterwards the appearing of vegetation. This is wonderfully scientific considering that the book of Genesis was written less than four thousand years ago, when people could hardly understand that vegetation is necessary to hold soil on its place and to prevent erosion! But the doubt is focused on this: why was the sun necessary for plant life made only the following day which is the fourth day? As I mentioned earlier, there are plants that can exist for some time even without sunlight. The possibility is that since vegetation and plant life were created at the end of the third day (of Creation), the sun was made to shine immediately at the start of the fourth day (Day 1 for Earth). This solves the scientific problem involved! While it is true that the bud of a seed that grows tend to the direction of light, it is also true that the budding process can start without light. A seed planted below the surface of the soil where there is no light will grow. REVISED STANDARD VERSION I CORINTHIANS 15:36-38 36 You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37 And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. 38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. We must also consider that when God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass,” he did not say “Let the dry land bring forth grass.” When God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass,” he meant the ground in dry land and the ground under the sea to bring forth plant life. It is worthwhile mentioning that “grass” – the plant life in the depths of the sea sustain most of marine creatures. GENESIS 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. The earliest evidence of land plants and fungi appears in the fossil record around 480 million years ago. Before that, the Earth’s landscape was believed to consist of barren rocks, home to bacteria and possibly some algae. But some have argued that it is quite possible for land-dwelling plants and fungi to have been around much earlier, but their primitive bodies were too soft to be preserved as fossils in rock. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1482382.stm). Science affirms – as do atheists guess – that marine life existed before land life. Richard Dawkins wrote that, being land-oriented now, one day he will go back to the sea. Dawkins is a British evolutionary biologist. I MUST GO DOWN TO THE SEA AGAIN The move from water to land launched a major redesign of every aspect of life, from breathing to reproduction: it was a great trek through biological space. Nevertheless, with what seems almost wanton perversity, a good number of thoroughgoing land animals later turned around, abandoned their hard-earned terrestrial retooling, and trooped back into the water again. Seals and sea lions have only gone part-way back. (The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins, Page 80). Note that marine life were brought forth first then land life. GENESIS 1:24-25 24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. Animals like cattle and creeping things were made by God at the dawn of the sixth day of creation and humans towards the end of the sixth day. (Creeping things are on dry land, not in the sea). This allows millions of years of animal existence before mankind. This also solves doubt about the existence of dinosaurs millions of years before mankind! A day in creation is not a 24-hour day as other Bible apologists claim! ISAIAH 66:8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. This is Part 4 of Possibilities and Impossibilities in the Bible. More to come.

Land plants began to diversify in the Late Silurian, from around 430 million years ago, and the results of their diversification are displayed in remarkable detail in an early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert. This chert, formed in volcanic hot springs, preserved several species of early plants in cellular detail by petrification."
how tall does a hill have to be a mountain,"['', 'The west side of Peak Mountain drains into Salmon Brook, then into the Farmington River, thence to the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound; the east side drains into the Connecticut River. Peak Mountain is traversed by the Metacomet Trail, which extends from the Hanging Hills of Meriden, Connecticut to the Massachusetts border. The mountain is open to hiking, bird watching, snowshoeing and other passive pursuits. Views from the summit include the Barn Door Hills and Manitook Mountain. High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing. There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.', '', 'Flora observations within 160 km (100 miles) of Esperance, Western Australia.', '', 'A strange title you might think since all hills presumably have a view, but these are some of Dorset’s best known hills and I thought I would feature them as my theme for this week. You might think that hills are something straightforward but they are not, as we shall see. For instance, we might start by asking the question, ‘When is a hill not a hill?’ Well, perhaps when it is a mountain, or maybe a hillock, or maybe a………. Well, you get my drift. Anyway, to get us going, I thought we could take a trip to Bulbarrow Hill, and just for a change, I thought we could make the trip in winter as well as summer. Bulbarrow Hill is arguably not technically a hill as it is actually a part of the Dorset Downs escarpment. It stands west of Blandford Forum and rises to 274 meters (899 feet) high. The hill overlooks the flatter land of the Blackmore Vale and therefore has some beautiful views. Although this is a very popular and well known viewpoint, it is not one of my favourites. This is because there is a road that runs along the top – I prefer my hills to be more wild and remote. Also, in some ways, you appreciate a view more if you have had to work for it 🙂 ! So, back to my question, ‘When is a hill not a hill?’ Well the answer could be, ‘When it is a mountain’. There are some differing views on when hills become mountains and it will\xa0depend on whether you are considering its pure height above sea level, its height compared to its surroundings, its steepness, spacing, cragginess, etc etc. These have all been used at times to define mountains. The Oxford English dictionary gives one\xa0definition as, ‘a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable’.\xa0Generally, in the UK (it gets way too\xa0complex if you look at UN international definitions!) a mountain is recognised by hill walkers as being over 2,000 feet (the Government suggests 600 meters but hey, who’s counting). On this basis there are no mountains in Dorset. Scotland, however, by this definition has lots of mountains although a lot\xa0of them bear the title of ‘hills’. Its definitely not an exact science 🙂 ! At the other end of the scale it becomes even more difficult as there are no real definitions for Hillocks or Knolls – they are just small hills with an undefined height 🙂 ! And names and categories, now that’s another thing……but we will leave that subject for a later post. Dorset is full of hills of the rolling variety rather than the craggy and Bulbarrow is one of the best known, and probably loved by most people. In truth, it is a beautiful area to walk and I do so frequently by climbing it on foot despite there being a road 🙂 ! Thanks for stopping by.

who wrote the song we built this city,"['For this “Things That Bring Back Memories” post, I am going to pick something in the topic of “Music”. \xa0My family is one that really loves music, and can think back to where we were when we heard a certain song, etc. \xa0I can’t play music for anything, but my husband is a bass guitar player, and our\xa0son plays the piano. \xa0Lucky I don’t have to do anything but listen, otherwise, we’d be in trouble. :/ So starting on this beautiful Monday of the week, I’ll give you a little look into my life and past with “Things That Brings Back Memories” for me. \xa0This Starship\xa0song We Built This City\xa0is one that a lot of us remember.\xa0 \xa0So many of us would give each other that “look” when this came on the radio and then start our rendition in karaoke mode!! 🙂\xa0\xa0Apparently listeners loved it, sending it to the top of the Billboard charts.\xa0 But since then it’s topped (or placed) in critics’ lists in publications like Blender and Rolling Stone as one of the worst popular tunes ever recorded.\xa0 How sad!\xa0 I never thought it was a bad one.\xa0\xa0Have you ever heard of this song? \xa0Check it out here: Is there a song that brings back memories for you? or an area that you lived? \xa0Leave a comment and let me know. We Built This City\xa0is a 1985 song written by Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf, and originally recorded by US rock group Starship and released as their debut single on their album Knee Deep in the Hoopla. Commercially, the single reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the United States, the top 10 in Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland, the top 20 in Belgium, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and number 21 in Austria and the Netherlands. It has appeared on several “worst song” lists, topping a 2011 Rolling Stone poll of worst songs of the 1980’s by a wide margin. What exists of a narrative in the song consists of an argument between the singers (Mickey Thomas and Grace Slick) and an unidentified “you”, presumably a music industry executive, who is marginalizing the band and ripping them off by “playing corporation games” (“who counts the money underneath the bar?”). In response to this injustice, the singers remind the villain of their importance and fame: “Listen to the radio! Don’t you remember? We built this city on rock and roll!” A spoken-word interlude explicitly mentions the Golden Gate Bridge and refers to “the city by the bay”, a common moniker for Starship’s hometown of San Francisco; Starship’s predecessors, Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, were prominent members of San Francisco’s psychedelic rock scene in the late 1960’s and into the 1970’s. However, the interlude then rapidly refers to the same city as “the city that rocks”, a reference to Cleveland, Ohio (home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum), and then “the city that never sleeps”, one of the nicknames for New York City. Capitalizing on the ambiguity, several radio stations added descriptions of their own local areas when they broadcast the song, or even simply added their own indent in its place. Mickey Thomas joined joined Jefferson Starship in 1979. Mickey’s voice had become legendary after recording “Fooled Around and Fell in Love” with the Elvin Bishop Band and he was planning to pursue a solo career. Jefferson Starship quickly proved to be the right decision as they recorded their first hit, “Jane”, almost immediately after getting together. In 1985, Starship released the album that would come to define the eighties, Knee Deep in the Hoopla. Featuring two #1 hits – “We Built this City” and “Sara” – the album reached #7 on Billboard and went platinum. Starship followed- up their initial success with another #1 single, “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” featured on the soundtrack for Mannequin. As Starship continued to reach the top of the charts, MTV infiltrated pop culture and the band released videos for all of their hits that are still popular today. Starship music is featured in the soundtracks for “Rock of Ages,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Skeleton Twins,” and most recently on the popular TV series “Glee”. Starship is on tour now, delighting audiences around the world. I agree – music is amazing for that.  Now I just wish I could remember where I put my keys! 🙂 I was 7 and I remember the song very well. I didn’t realize they also sang Sara and the song from the movie Mannequin. Great 80s hits indeed! It’s fun to find out new details about different bands, and songs. 🙂 Seeing this reminded me of another one of their songs “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” which was from the movie Mannequin. I watched that movie so much as a kid and had such a crush on Andrew McCarthy. I don’t remember this song it may have been before my time lol. Nothing like some good nostalgia! Of Course I remember, how could I forget?  I love this song.  This section of your blog always has the most interesting of posts.  Old songs will never run out so I look forward to reading these often!']","""We Built This City"" is a 1985 song written by Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf, and originally recorded by US rock group Starship and released as their debut single on their album Knee Deep in the Hoopla."
which action by the state of maryland led to mcculloch v. maryland,"['17 U.S. 316 (1819); a landmark United States Supreme Court decision.  In this case, the state of Maryland attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable, the U.S. Bank was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law is generally recognized as specifically targeting the U.S. Bank. The Court invoked the Elastic Clause in the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution\'s list of express powers as long as those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers. 17 U.S. 316 McCulloch v. Maryland Congress has power to incorporate a bank. The Act of the 10th of April, 1816, ch. 44, to ""incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States"" is a law made in pursuance of the Constitution. The Government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action, and its laws, when made in pursuance of the Constitution, form the supreme law of the land. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States similar to the Articles of Confederation, which exclude incidental or implied powers. If the end be legitimate, and within the scope of the Constitution, all the means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may constitutionally be employed to carry it into effect. The power of establishing a corporation is not a distinct sovereign power or end of Government, but only the means of carrying into effect other powers which are sovereign. Whenever it becomes an appropriate means of exercising any of the powers given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union, it may be exercised by that Government. If a certain means to carry into effect of any of the powers expressly given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union be an appropriate measure, not prohibited by the Constitution, the degree of its necessity is a question of legislative discretion, not of judicial cognizance. The Bank of the United States has, constitutionally, a right to establish its branches or offices of discount and deposit within any state. The State within which such branch may be established cannot, without violating the Constitution, tax that branch. The State governments have no right to tax any of the constitutional means employed by the Government of the Union to execute its constitutional powers. The States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burthen, or in any manner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into effect the powers vested in the national Government. This principle does not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the Bank of the United States in common with the other real property in a particular state, nor to a tax imposed on the proprietary interest which the citizens of that State may hold in this institution, in common with other property of the same description throughout the State. This was an action of debt, brought by the defendant in error, John James, who sued as well for himself as for the State of Maryland, in the County Court of Baltimore County, in the said State, against the plaintiff in error, McCulloch, to recover certain penalties, under the act of the Legislature of Maryland hereafter mentioned. Judgment being rendered against the plaintiff in error, upon the following statement of facts agreed and submitted to the court by the parties, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland, the highest court of law of said State, and the cause was brought by writ of error to this Court. It is admitted by the parties in this cause, by their counsel, that there was passed, on the 10th day of April, 1816, by the Congress of the United States, an act entitled, ""an act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States;"" and that there was passed on the 11th day of February, 1818, by the General Assembly of Maryland, an act, entitled, ""an act to impose a tax on all banks, or branches thereof, in the State of Maryland, not chartered by the legislature,"" [p318] which said acts are made part of this Statement, and it is agreed, may be read from the statute books in which they are respectively printed. It is further admitted that the President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, incorporated by the act of Congress aforesaid, did organize themselves, and go into full operation, in the City of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, in pursuance of the said act, and that they did on the ___ day of _____ 1817, establish a branch of the said bank, or an office of discount and deposit, in the City of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, which has, from that time until the first day of May 1818, ever since transacted and carried on business as a bank, or office of discount and deposit, and as a branch of the said Bank of the United States, by issuing bank notes and discounting promissory notes, and performing other operations usual and customary for banks to do and perform, under the authority and by the direction of the said President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, established at Philadelphia as aforesaid. It is further admitted that the said President, directors and company of the said bank had no authority to establish the said branch, or office of discount and deposit, at the City of Baltimore, from the State of Maryland, otherwise than the said State having adopted the Constitution of the United States and composing one of the States of the Union. It is further admitted that James William McCulloch, the defendant below, being the cashier of the said branch, or office of discount and [p319] deposit did, on the several days set forth in the declaration in this cause, issue the said respective bank notes therein described, from the said branch or office, to a certain George Williams, in the City of Baltimore, in part payment of a promissory note of the said Williams, discounted by the said branch or office, which said respective bank notes were not, nor was either of them, so issued on stamped paper in the manner prescribed by the act of assembly aforesaid. It is further admitted that the said President, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, and the said branch, or office of discount and deposit have not, nor has either of them, paid in advance, or otherwise, the sum of $15,000, to the Treasurer of the Western Shore, for the use of the State of Maryland, before the issuing of the said notes, or any of them, nor since those periods. And it is further admitted that the Treasurer of the Western Shore of Maryland, under the direction of the Governor and Council of the said State, was ready, and offered to deliver to the said President, directors and company of the said bank, and to the said branch, or office of discount and deposit, stamped paper of the kind and denomination required and described in the said act of assembly. The question submitted to the Court for their decision in this case is as to the validity of the said act of the General Assembly of Maryland on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress aforesaid, or to one of them. Upon the foregoing statement of facts and the pleadings in this cause (all errors in [p320] which are hereby agreed to be mutually released), if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then judgment, it is agreed, shall be entered for the plaintiffs for $2,500 and costs of suit. B ut if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover upon the statement and pleadings aforesaid, then judgment of non pros shall be entered, with costs to the defendant. It is agreed that either party may appeal from the decision of the County Court to the Court of Appeals, and from the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States, according to the modes and usages of law, and have the same benefit of this statement of facts in the same manner as could be had if a jury had been sworn and impanneled in this cause and a special verdict had been found, or these facts had appeared and been stated in an exception taken to the opinion of the Court, and the Court\'s direction to the jury thereon. Copy of the act of the Legislature of the State of Maryland, referred to in the preceding Statement. This page is not available in other languages.', '', 'In framing the U.S. Constitution, the leaders of the time gave certain specific powers to Congress, reserving all other powers to the individual states. This was done in order to ensure the new government would not become an oppressive entity, such as the government they had left behind in England. These men knew, however, that they could not foresee the needs of the country as it grew and developed. The final provision of Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to enact laws that are “necessary and proper” in the execution of their enumerated powers. To explore this concept, consider the following\xa0necessary and proper clause\xa0definition. U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8 The Necessary and Proper Clause, often referred to as the “Elastic Clause,” pertains to powers not expressly given to Congress in the United States Constitution, but which may be necessary and proper to accomplish their constitutional charges. Congressional powers are found in different places in the Constitution, but the Necessary and Proper Clause is contained in the last paragraph of Article 1, Section 8. This clause provides the federal government with flexibility when it comes to creating laws when the Constitution does not give Congress the specific authority to act, hence the moniker “Elastic Clause.” “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” The U.S. Constitution specifically lays out the powers granted to Congress. While many people look to the powers specifically listed in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress is granted other powers in various sections of the document, subject to the limitations in the Bill of Rights. The term “enumerated” means to mention certain things one by one, or to specify certain things individually in a list. The powers specifically listed in Section 8 of Article 1 are referred to as “Enumerated Powers.” The enumerated powers dictate how the branches of the federal government, including Congress can and should operate. There are some Congressional powers not specifically listed in the Constitution, but which are seen as obviously necessary to exercise the powers granted. These are referred to as “implied powers.” As an example, some of the enumerated powers in the U.S. Constitution give Congress the power to: Framers of the Constitution knew that not all of the powers Congress would need in an ever-changing world could be listed explicitly. To address this problem, the Necessary and Proper Clause was drafted. The Clause, however, immediately sparked a storm of dispute, as anti-federalists contended it would give the federal government unlimited powers. Federalists argued that the clause would only give the government the authority to accomplish those powers listed in the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison argued on behalf of the Clause, believing that without it, the Constitution would not be effective. The Clause was eventually placed in the Constitution, and the first practical example of its use came into play in 1791 when Alexander Hamilton stretched the Elastic Clause to defend the formation of the First Bank of the United States. The bank was the first federal bank of the new nation, and James Madison argued that, while Congress does have the authority to print money, it does not have the authority to charter a bank. Hamilton, on the other hand, believed that the Necessary and Proper Clause related to constitutional powers, and therefore creating the bank was a reasonable means of carrying out its powers related to the economy. In 1816, Congress created an act actually titled “An Act to Incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of the United States.” This addressed the issue of the taxes levied by the state of Maryland, where the Second Bank of the United States (successor to the First Bank of the United States), on all bank notes issued by banks not chartered by the state of Maryland. This meant that any bank, including the Second Bank of the U.S., not given specific governmental permission to operate in its location, would be taxed for bank notes, promissory notes, and other negotiable instruments. When the First Bank of the United States was formed, with branches in three cities, it began doing normal banking activities, such as issuing bank notes, marking down promissory notes, taking in deposits, and performing other normal banking activities. At that time, some questioned the authority of the federal government to establish a bank. When the branch was established in Baltimore, Maryland, a dispute arose on the topic, as James McCulloch, head of the Baltimore brand of the Second Bank, refused to pay the state tax. In the ensuing litigation, the state of Maryland argued that “the Constitution is silent on the subject of banks,” making such power a reserved power that may be solely exercised by the states. Interestingly enough, both sides agreed that neither the President of the United States, Congress, nor the directors and company of the Bank had the authority to establish a bank in Pennsylvania without the state’s consent. The trial court ruled in favor of the state, though that decision was appealed by the federal government. When the appellate court upheld the trial court’s decision, the matter was taken before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress did indeed have the power to create a bank. In the Court’s written decision, Chief Justice John Marshall cited several reasons for the Court’s decision, finally bringing to mind the Necessary and Proper Clause, which gives Congress the power to act, or to create legislation for the purpose of accomplishing any of the powers assigned to the federal government by the Constitution. Such authority is referred to as inferred powers. This holds true as long as the act or legislation can reasonably seen as necessary and proper to accomplishing the government’s goal, and that the act or legislation is not specifically forbidden by the Constitution. When the Court made this ruling, it nullified Maryland’s assumption that the word “necessary” in the Necessary and Proper clause of the Constitution gave Congress only the power to enact laws that are crucial to the performance of its enumerated powers. Justice Marshall pointed out, in the ruling, that many enumerated powers would be useless if Congress could only enact laws absolutely essential to the execution of an enumerated power. Finally, Justice Marshall made public note of the fact that the Necessary and Proper Clause is contained within the powers granted to Congress, not in the section listing its limitations.', 'We use cookies on our website to give you the best online experience.

The Federal Reserve System fulfills its public mission as an independent entity within government. Congress established the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks as the operating arms of the nation\'s central banking system. The Reserve Banks are organized similarly to private corporations—possibly leading to some confusion about ""ownership."" For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan. Dividends are, by law, paid to member banks at a maximum rate of 6 percent, determined in part by each member bank\'s total assets. The stockholders in the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are the privately owned banks that fall under the Federal Reserve System. These include all national banks (chartered by the federal government) and those state-chartered banks that wish to join and meet certain requirements. About 38 percent of the nation\'s more than 8,000 banks are members of the system, and thus own the Reserve Banks. The concept of ""ownership"" needs some explaining here, however. The member banks must by law invest 3 percent of their capital as stock in the Reserve Banks, and they cannot sell or trade their stock or even use that stock as collateral to borrow money. They do receive dividends of 6 percent per year from the Reserve Banks and get to elect each Reserve Bank\'s board of directors. The Federal Reserve Act requires that three bankers serve on each Reserve Bank\'s nine-member board of directors. The other six members represent the public and are not bankers. The majority of the bankers on Federal Reserve Bank boards of directors are from smaller firms. Community bankers provide insight into local economic conditions, and having them on the board, where they can provide regular updates, helps the Federal Reserve gauge the economy. The banking directors aren\'t involved in bank supervision, and the directors who represent private banks don\'t participate in choosing the Reserve Bank presidents. To avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest resulting from the financial interests and outside affiliations of Reserve Bank directors, Reserve Banks may not provide confidential supervisory information to any director. Moreover, Reserve Bank directors may not participate in bank supervisory matters and may not be consulted regarding bank examination ratings, potential enforcement actions, application/approval matters, or similar supervisory matters. Similarly, because of the potential for an actual or perceived conflict of interest, Class A (banker) directors may not be involved in the selection, appointment, or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve supervisory matters. Class B directors who are affiliated with a thrift holding company that is supervised by the Federal Reserve may also not be involved in the selection, appointment, or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve supervisory matters. The Federal Reserve, like many other central banks, is an independent government agency, but it is ultimately accountable to the public and to Congress. The Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by Congress, which often reviews the Federal Reserve\'s activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute. Therefore, the Federal Reserve can be more accurately described as ""independent within the government"" rather than ""independent of government."" The constitutionality of central banking was established through a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. (A precedent is a legal principle that becomes an authority for judges to use in deciding future cases of a similar issue.) The case, McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 (1819), was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The case established that the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers for implementing the Constitution\'s expressed powers, and established that federal laws and treaties are supreme over state law. Therefore, when Congress enacted the law to incorporate the Second Bank of the United States, it was a valid exercise of its constitutional powers. U.S. Supreme Court: McCulloch v. Maryland 17 U.S. 316 (1819) No. Congress established the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks as the operating arms of the nation\'s central banking system. The Reserve Banks are organized similarly to private corporations—possibly leading to some confusion about ""ownership."" For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company.

The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan. Dividends are, by law, paid to member banks at a maximum rate of 6 percent, determined in part by each member bank\'s total assets. Member banks of the Federal Reserve hold stock in the Reserve Bank for their district. Individuals cannot hold stock. Member banks include all nationally chartered banks and any state-chartered banks that choose to become members. More than 8,000 depository institutions representing approximately 34 percent of the nation\'s banks are members of the system. Although these banks are member owners, they have no control of monetary policy or supervisory authority and make no decisions in these areas. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is deliberative in setting the target for the fed funds rate. In preparation for each FOMC meeting, policymakers analyze economic and financial developments and update their forecasts of economic activity, employment, and inflation over the near and medium term. The materials they and their staffs review include a wide range of U.S. and international economic and financial data, statistical and judgmental economic forecasts, and analyses of alternative policy approaches. Participants also consult business, consumer, and financial industry contacts to hear their perspectives on economic and financial conditions and the outlook. At the meeting itself, staff officers present oral reports on the current and prospective business situation, on conditions in financial markets, and on international financial developments. In its discussions, the Committee considers factors such as trends in prices and wages, employment and production, consumer income and spending, residential and commercial construction, business investment and inventories, foreign exchange markets, interest rates, money and credit aggregates, and fiscal policy. After these reports, the Committee members and other Reserve Bank presidents turn to policy. Typically, each participant expresses his or her own views on the state of the economy and prospects for the future and on the appropriate direction for monetary policy. Then each makes a more explicit policy recommendation. Finally, the Committee must reach a consensus regarding the appropriate course for policy, which is incorporated in a directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—the Bank that executes transactions for the System Open Market Account. Policy is implemented with emphasis on supplying reserves in a manner consistent with these objectives and with the nation\'s broader economic objectives. The FOMC releases minutes of its meetings three weeks after the date of the policy decision. The Fed has both public and private components.\xa0 It is a ""decentralized central"" bank, consisting of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., a network of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and their branches, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Board of Governors, located in Washington, D.C., is a federal government agency that is the Fed\'s centralized component. The seven members of the Board of Governors guide the Federal Reserve\'s policy actions, study trends in the economy, and help forecast the country\'s future economic direction. The governors also participate in monetary policymaking on the FOMC. In addition, the Board of Governors is responsible for regulations to keep the banking system sound and for overseeing the operations of the 12 Reserve Banks. Reserve Banks operate somewhat independently but under the general oversight of the Board of Governors. These Reserve Banks, and their branches, are strategically located in large cities across the country. The economists and other employees in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts work together to provide a regional perspective and expert knowledge about their local economies. The Fed\'s unique structure helps insulate it from short-term political pressures and allows it to balance different interests—national and regional, public and private. It is an independent central bank in that neither the president nor Congress has to approve its monetary policy decisions. At the same time, the Federal Reserve works within the government in the sense that it formulates monetary policy to achieve overall goals that Congress and the president set. Like the federal government, the Federal Reserve System was designed to be a compromise between national and regional powers. Its regional base—the 12 Reserve Banks—makes the Fed more flexible and innovative and ensures that its decisions and actions are broadly based. The Board of Governors, acting as general overseer of the Reserve Banks, helps coordinate the Fed\'s operations. And the Federal Reserve\'s most important function—formulating and implementing monetary policy—is carried out in light of both regional and national concerns by the Board of Governors, the Reserve Banks, and the FOMC. Yes. The Fed is audited extensively. The Government Accountability Office audits Federal Reserve activities.\xa0 The Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks publish their financial statements, and a full list of audits is available on the Board of Governors\' website. The proposed ""audit the Fed"" legislation asks whether it is prudent to audit monetary policymaking. ""Auditing"" the Fed in its current portrayal means inserting political and partisan interests into the monetary policymaking process. The concern with the ""audit the Fed"" bill is that it would not ensure transparency of policy as such but would influence policy decisions in real time. History shows, not only in the United States but also around the world, that central bank independence promotes better economic performance. Countries where monetary policy is more susceptible to short-term political interests have higher inflation outcomes—a result that is clearly not in the best interest of Main Street Americans. The Fed is ultimately accountable to the Congress and the American public, and it seeks to be as transparent about its actions as possible. But good governance calls for a healthy degree of separation between those who spend taxpayers\' money and those who print it. U.S. money gets its value from its purchasing power. The real value of money is determined by the goods and services it can buy. As long as people accept money during such transactions, money maintains its ability to purchase. Paper currency represented a claim on a certain amount of gold or silver during much of U.S. history. However, in 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt removed the United States from the gold standard. The Federal Reserve Banks do hold collateral—U.S. government securities—equal to the value of Federal Reserve notes—that is, paper currency—in circulation. Hence, U.S. currency is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. It is fiat money, established through government decree. The Fed is audited extensively. The Government Accountability Office audits Federal Reserve activities. The Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks publish their financial statements, and a full list of audits is available on the Board of Governors\' website. The Fed publishes its balance sheet every week and minutes of monetary policy deliberations after every meeting. You can find detailed information about the Fed\'s activities during the financial crisis and much more on the Board\'s website. Our leaders speak frequently and substantively in public, and our chair responds directly to journalists\' questions at regular news conferences. The Federal Reserve does not receive funding through the congressional budgetary process. The Fed\'s income comes primarily from the interest on government securities that it has acquired through open market operations. Other sources of income are the interest on foreign currency investments held by the Federal Reserve System; fees received for services provided to depository institutions, such as check clearing, funds transfers, and automated clearinghouse operations; and interest on loans to depository institutions. Federal Reserve Banks are not operated for a profit. After covering expenses, which are regularly audited and made public in the Board\'s annual report, the Fed transfers any earnings to the U.S. Treasury. In 2016, that amount was $92.7 billion.', ""Please disable your Ad Blocker to better interact with this website. The stories that matter to you, told by you, to millions of readers. No spin.

The first to seek refuge in the new world were religious dissidents seeking freedom to worship as they saw fit. In England, the law demanded the citizens to be members of the Church of England. No other religion was tolerated, which drove Puritans along with other Christian faiths and those who practiced the Jewish faith. The first of the Northern Colonies to be settled was the Massachusetts Bay Colony, while in the South Virginia. As more immigrated to the new world, those colonizing the South based their economies on agriculture that required were labor intensive; while those in the North due to the shorter growing season, based their economy on commerce that would eventually lead to the industrial side. By this time each of the colonies had already set up their form of government and resisted British control, seeing more as an intrusion than anything else. As the British placed more pressure on the colonies to comply with British rule, the more the colonies refused to comply. This led to the creation of the Colonial Government. By 1775 the Colonies agreed the only way to win their independence, was to declare a collective Declaration for Independence. By July 4th 1776 fifty-four representatives from all thirteen colonies had signed the declaration which was sent to King George III. The Signing of the Declaration of Independence was the official creation of our Union. At this point the Colonies had no intention of creating a new country. The Colonies only goal was the return to being self-governing, with as small of a centralized Government as possible. By the end of 1777 the Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union were complete and sent to the thirteen colonies for ratification. Even before the Articles of Confederation was ratified it gave The Continental Congress a means of directing the Revolutionary War. Article I establish the name of the Union to be called the United States of America.While Article II asserted that all States would maintain sovereignty and self-governing power. The remaining three articles ascertained an agreement of cooperation and friendship between the states with all legal citizens having the ability to move freely throughout the country; while the Federal Government would have very limited powers over the union. Not long after creating the Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union was simply inadequate. Once again the Continental Congress created a panel of representatives to create a more suitable Constitution. The biggest concern in creating this new constitution was giving the Federal Government too much power. They had just fought a revolution to obtain their own sovereignty. So they had no desire to create a centralized Government who had too much power. All of the delegates agreed that a Federal Government was required to meet the needs of the States, beyond that the new country wanted to maintain state sovereignty. During the ratification process, several states had refused to ratify the constitution feared the Federal Government held enough power to take control over the states and without amendments to address their concerns, they refused to ratify the Constitution. After the Bill of Rights was created with the freedom to establish more amendments when needed, Ratification of the Constitution went into effect in 1789. Of the Bill of Rights, Thomas Jefferson being an anti-federalist believed the tenth amendment to be the foundation to the constitution. The tenth amendment states that “Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, while maintaining their power jurisdiction, and rights, that were not expressly covered under the Constitution.” At the time of the writing of the Bill of rights power was given to congress through Article VI Section II known as the supremacy clause. That stated the laws contained in the Constitution was the supreme Law of the land and the law shall rule even if it conflicts with State Laws. The first attack on our States sovereignty came with the Alien and Sedition Act passed by congress in 1789. Both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison claimed Government over-reach. Though debatable, this would prove to be the first of many attacks by the Federal Government and our 10th amendment. Of the three branches of Government, the Supreme Court has led the way in taking away our state’s sovereignty, beginning with McCulloch vs. Maryland (1819). This case though in appearance does not seem unreasonable. This ruling would enable the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided under the Constitution, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution. This single ruling paved the way for the Federal Government to essentially obtain supreme power over the entire government, including the constitution and Bill of Rights. Though our forefathers did everything they could to ensure the Sovereignty of our States. It was the way the 10th amendment was worded that gave the Supreme Court a means to exploit the wording that would give the Federal Government supreme power over the Constitution of the United States of America. Supreme Court justice John Marshal is therefore to blame for our states losing the power to self-govern. Today not only is our 10th amendment rights in jeopardy due to this single ruling, the entire constitution along with the Bill of Rights and every subsequent amendment. Though the assured Sovereignty of the states can be argued by referring to the Articles of Confederation and Federalist #45, the Court has elected to ignore the federalist papers and articles of confederation. Until Congress is willing to address McCulloch vs. Maryland and rules that this case is in violation of the Constitution, the Federal Government will continue to eliminate our rights while dismantling The Constitution of the United States of America.

The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the Bank of the United States. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution."
