what is the money supply of the us,"['Parents probably dream of sending their kid to the University of Chicago.   Next to the Ivy League or Stanford, the Chicago school is near the top of the   heap. Only 27 percent of applicants are admitted. To be among the roughly 15,000   means prestige and an education to build a lifetime on. The cost for tuition and   fees: $39,381. Room and board is another $12,000 or so. Add books and other   stuff, and the total Chicago-school experience costs $54,290 a year. Students learn from the likes of University of Chicago economics professor   Casey B. Mulligan, who believes what the economy needs right now is a little   inflation in all the right places to make things better. Professor Mulligan writes for the ""Economix"" section of the New York Times, which goes   about the task of ""Explaining the Science of Everyday Life."" Mulligan writes that normally inflation is harmful, but ""these days inflation   may do less harm than good."" He points out that the prices of most goods march   upward over time and that this ""general increase in consumer prices is called   inflation."" Of course that\'s not true. The increase in prices is the   result of inflation, which is the increasing of the supply of money: thus   the term ""inflating"" the money supply. The Chicago economist then writes that the Federal Reserve is charged with   limiting inflation, ""which it can do over the long run by limiting the supply of   money and similar assets in the hands of the public."" In the long run, the Federal Reserve has decimated a dollar\'s value down to 2   cents in the just short of a century it has been around. In August of 1971, M2   money supply was $685 billion, in March 2011, M2 was $8.9 trillion. Mulligan writes that people complain about rising prices, but forget that   their wages are going up at the same time, so consumer purchasing power is   unharmed. Inflation-adjusted wages have been flat to negative. It has taken two   incomes to pay for a household for decades now. Perhaps Mulligan should get out   more. Seniors should quit bitching, according to Mulligan because, ""Social Security   benefits automatically increase with wages in the economy, and thereby   automatically increase with inflation in the long run."" However, according to Social   Security Online, ""Under existing law, there can be no COLA   [cost-of-living adjustment] in 2011."" Why? As determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is no increase in the   CPI-W [Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers] from   the third quarter of 2008, the last year a COLA was determined, to the third   quarter of 2010. So the government says there is no price inflation and so no COLA for you,   retirees. Retirees know better and so does John Williams at Shadowstats,   who says prices are increasing at a 10 percent rate. Government spending leads to government borrowing, which leads to inflation   when central banks create money out of nowhere to fund that debt. However, the   Chicago economist claims his work shows that inflation is not associated with   increased government spending. Rightly, Mulligan points out that taxes crimp saving and investment. But for   his big finish, Mulligan claims that since so many people are underwater on   their mortgages and because this is hampering economic growth, ""an inflation   that harmed banks and helped homeowners might be an overall improvement."" One gets the impression that in Mulligan\'s ivory-tower world, Ben Bernanke   creates money like Picasso painted a picture. After careful contemplation,   staring at the canvass (economy), Ben dabs his brush into his palette, and then,   calmly and carefully, applies the proper color and amount of paint (money), a   gentle stroke, in just the right spot. F.A. Hayek, who joined the Committee on Social Thought at the University of   Chicago in 1950, believed that money printing could not be used to assure total   employment or to pump up the prices of desired assets whether they be houses or   something else. It was impossible for central bankers to know where the money   would go or what the exact effects would be. In the study of such complex phenomena as the market, which depend on the   actions of many individuals, all the circumstances which will determine the   outcome of a process … will hardly ever be fully known or   measurable. So while Mulligan sees Bernanke with a fine-tipped artist\'s brush, the Fed is   actually using a spray gun with an unknowable fan size. The money goes some   places and not others. There are bubbles in art prices, while tract-home prices sink. Catfish prices   are jumping, but television   prices are sinking. Peter Klein wrote that while at   Chicago Hayek found himself among a dazzling group, with an economics department   led by Frank Knight, Milton Friedman, and later George Stigler. Back in 1950, having Hayek and Knight teach your kid economics would have   been worth the price. But $50,000 for Professor Mulligan\'s theories?

the effect of more relative humidity on human health is,"['Humidity  is the amount of water vapor in the air. Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible.[1] Humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog.  Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin.  This effect is calculated in a heat index table or humidex. The amount of water vapor that is needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large, for example; A parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 30\xa0°C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 8\xa0°C There are three main measurements of humidity: absolute, relative and specific. Absolute humidity is the water content of air at a given temperature expressed in gram per cubic meter.[2] Relative humidity, expressed as a percent, measures the current absolute humidity relative to the maximum (highest point) for that temperature. Specific humidity is a ratio of the water vapor content of the mixture to the total air content on a mass basis. Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor present in a given volume of air. It does not take temperature into consideration. Absolute humidity in the atmosphere ranges from near zero to roughly 30\xa0grams per cubic meter when the air is saturated at 30\xa0°C.[4] The absolute humidity changes as air temperature or pressure changes.  This makes it unsuitable for chemical engineering calculations, e.g. for clothes dryers, where temperature can vary considerably.  As a result, absolute humidity in chemical engineering may refer to mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the mass mixing ratio (see ""specific humidity"" below), which is better suited for heat and mass balance calculations.  Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above is also defined as volumetric humidity.  Because of the potential confusion, British Standard BS 1339 (revised 2002) suggests avoiding the term ""absolute humidity"".  Units should always be carefully checked.  Many humidity charts are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used. The field concerned with the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas–vapor mixtures is named psychrometrics. Relative humidity is normally expressed as a percentage; a higher percentage means that the air-water mixture is more humid. Relative humidity is an important metric used in weather forecasts and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog.  In hot summer weather, a rise in relative humidity increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin. For example, according to the Heat Index, a relative humidity of 75% at air temperature of 80.0\xa0°F (26.7\xa0°C) would feel like 83.6\xa0°F ±1.3\xa0°F (28.7\xa0°C ±0.7\xa0°C). [8][9] Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of water vapor mass () to the air parcel\'s total (i.e., including dry) mass () and is sometimes referred to as the humidity ratio.[10]  Specific humidity is approximately equal to the ""mixing ratio"", which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel.[10] As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large, for example; A parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at −1\xa0°C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at −12\xa0°C. However, specific humidity is also defined as the ratio of water vapor to the total mass of the system (dry air plus water vapor).[11] For example, the ASHRAE 2009 Handbook, Ch1,1.2, (9a) defines specific humidity as ""the ratio of the mass of water vapor to total mass of the moist air sample"". There are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity. A device used to measure humidity is called a psychrometer or hygrometer. A humidistat is a humidity-triggered switch, often used to control a dehumidifier. Humidity is also measured on a global scale using remotely placed satellites. These satellites are able to detect the concentration of water in the troposphere at altitudes between 4 and 12 kilometers. Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to infrared radiation. Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band. Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions (like the formation of thunderstorms) and in the development of weather forecasts. While humidity itself is a climate variable, it also interacts strongly with other climate variables. The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall. At the same time, humidity affects the energy budget and thereby influences temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor in the atmosphere contains ""latent"" energy. During transpiration or evaporation, this latent heat is removed from surface liquid, cooling the earth\'s surface. This is the biggest non-radiative cooling effect at the surface. It compensates for roughly 70% of the average net radiative warming at the surface. Second, water vapor is the most abundant of all greenhouse gases. Water vapor, like a green lens that allows green light to pass through it but absorbs red light, is a ""selective absorber"". Along with other greenhouse gases, water vapor is transparent to most solar energy, as you can literally see. But it absorbs the infrared energy emitted (radiated) upward by the earth\'s surface, which is the reason that humid areas experience very little nocturnal cooling but dry desert regions cool considerably at night. This selective absorption causes the greenhouse effect. It raises the surface temperature substantially above its theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature with the sun, and water vapor is the cause of more of this warming than any other greenhouse gas. Unlike most other greenhouse gases, however, water is not merely below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but below its freezing point at many altitudes.  As a condensible greenhouse gas, it precipitates, with a much lower scale height and shorter atmospheric lifetime- weeks instead of decades.  Without other greenhouse gases, Earth\'s blackbody temperature, below the freezing point of water, would cause water vapor to be removed from the atmosphere.[12][13][14]  Water vapor is thus a ""slave"" to the non-condensible greenhouse gases.[15][16][17] The most humid cities on earth are generally located closer to the equator, near coastal regions. Cities in South and Southeast Asia are among the most humid. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Singapore have very high humidity all year round because of their proximity to water bodies and the equator and often overcast weather. Some places experience extreme humidity during their rainy seasons combined with warmth giving the feel of a lukewarm sauna, such as Kolkata, Chennai and Cochin in India, and Lahore in Pakistan. Sukkur city located on the Indus River in Pakistan has some of the highest and most uncomfortable dew point in the country frequently exceeding 30\xa0°C (86\xa0°F) in the Monsoon season.[18] High temperatures couple up with bizarre dew point to create heat index in excess of 65\xa0°C (149\xa0°F). Darwin, Australia experiences an extremely humid wet season from December to April. Shanghai and Hong Kong in China also have an extreme humid period in their summer months. During the South-west and North-east Monsoon seasons (respectively, late May to September and November to March), expect heavy rains and a relatively high humidity post-rainfall. Outside the monsoon seasons, humidity is high (in comparison to countries North of the Equator), but completely sunny days abound. In cooler places such as Northern Tasmania, Australia, high humidity is experienced all year due to the ocean between mainland Australia and Tasmania. In the summer the hot dry air is absorbed by this ocean and the temperature rarely climbs above 35\xa0°C (95\xa0°F). In the United States the most humid cities, strictly in terms of relative humidity, are Forks and Olympia, Washington.[19] This fact may come as a surprise to many, as the climate in this region rarely exhibits the discomfort usually associated with high humidity. This is because high dew points play a more significant role than relative humidity in discomfort, and so the air in these western cities usually does not feel ""humid"" as a result. In general, dew points are much lower in the Western U.S. than those in the Eastern U.S. The highest dew points in the US are found in coastal Florida and Texas. When comparing Key West and Houston, two of the most humid cities from those states, coastal Florida seems to have the higher dew points on average. However, Houston lacks the coastal breeze present in Key West, and, as a much larger city, it suffers from the urban heat island effect.[20]  A dew point of 88\xa0°F (31\xa0°C) was recorded in Moorhead Minnesota on July 19, 2011, with a heat index of 133.5, although dew points over 80\xa0°F (27\xa0°C) are rare there.[21] The US city with the lowest annual humidity is Las Vegas, Nevada, averaging 39% for a high and 21% as a low.[22]  Appleton, Wisconsin registered a dew point of 90 degrees F on 13 July 1995 with an air temperature of 104 degrees resulting in a heat index of 149 degrees; this record has apparently held and in fact the highest dew point measured in the country bounced amongst or was tied by locations in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa during the preceding 70 years or more with locations in northern Illinois also coming close.  Dew points of 95 degrees are found on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at certain times. Humidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the ideal gas law. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the humidity content. This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity). Humid air is less dense than dry air because a molecule of water (M ≈ 18 u) is less massive than either a molecule of nitrogen (M ≈ 28) or a molecule of oxygen (M ≈ 32). About 78% of  the molecules in dry air are nitrogen (N2). Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen (O2). The final 1% of dry air is a mixture of other gases. For any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present in a particular volume is constant – see ideal gas law. So when water molecules (vapor) are introduced into that volume of dry air, the number of air molecules in the volume must decrease by the same number, if the temperature and pressure remain constant.  (The addition of water molecules, or any other molecules, to a gas, without removal of an equal number of other molecules, will necessarily require a change in temperature, pressure, or total volume; that is, a change in at least one of these three parameters.  If temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume increases, and the dry air molecules that were displaced will initially move out into the additional volume, after which the mixture will eventually become uniform through diffusion.)  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas—its density—decreases. Isaac Newton discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book Opticks.[23] Humidity is one of the fundamental abiotic factors that defines any habitat, and is a determinant of which animals and plants can thrive in a given environment.[24] The human body dissipates heat through perspiration and its evaporation. Heat convection, to the surrounding air, and thermal radiation are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, blood brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air, and a condition called hyperthermia results. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, less goes to the active muscles, the brain, and other internal organs. Physical strength declines, and fatigue occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in heat stroke or hyperthermia. Humans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions, the rate at which perspiration evaporates on the skin is lower than it would be under arid conditions. Because humans perceive the rate of heat transfer from the body rather than temperature itself, we feel warmer when the relative humidity is high than when it is low. Some people experience difficulty breathing in humid environments. Some cases may possibly be related to respiratory conditions such as asthma, while others may be the product of anxiety. Sufferers will often hyperventilate in response, causing sensations of numbness, faintness, and loss of concentration, among others. Air conditioning reduces discomfort in the summer not only by reducing temperature, but also by reducing humidity. In winter, heating cold outdoor air can decrease relative humidity levels indoor to below 30%, leading to discomfort such as dry skin, cracked lips and excessive thirst. Many electronic devices have humidity specifications, for example, 5% to 45%.  At the top end of the range, moisture may increase the conductivity of permeable insulators leading to malfunction. Too low humidity may make materials brittle. A particular danger to electronic items, regardless of the stated operating humidity range, is condensation. When an electronic item is moved from a cold place (e.g. garage, car, shed, an air conditioned space in the tropics) to a warm humid place (house, outside tropics), condensation may coat circuit boards and other insulators, leading to short circuit inside the equipment. Such short circuits may cause substantial permanent damage if the equipment is powered on before the condensation has evaporated. A similar condensation effect can often be observed when a person wearing glasses comes in from the cold (i.e. the glasses become foggy).[25] It is advisable to allow electronic equipment to acclimatise for several hours, after being brought in from the cold, before powering on. Some electronic devices can detect such a change and indicate, when plugged in and usually with a small droplet symbol, that they cannot be used until the risk from condensation has passed. In situations where time is critical, increasing air flow through the device\'s internals, such as removing the side panel from a PC case and directing a fan to blow into the case, will reduce significantly the time needed to acclimatise to the new environment. In contrast, a very low humidity level favors the build-up of static electricity, which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, electrostatic discharges can cause dielectric breakdown in solid state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. Data centers often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons. Common construction methods often produce building enclosures with a poor thermal boundary, requiring an insulation and air barrier system designed to retain indoor environmental conditions while resisting external environmental conditions.[26]  The energy-efficient, heavily-sealed architecture introduced in the 20th century also sealed off the movement of moisture, and this has resulted in a secondary problem of condensation forming in and around walls, which encourages the development of mold and mildew. Additionally, buildings with foundations not properly sealed will allow water to flow through the walls due to capillary action of pores found in masonry products. Solutions for energy-efficient buildings that avoid condensation are a current topic of architecture. High humidity can often have a negative effect on the capacity of chemical plants and refineries that use furnaces as part of the process (e.g. steam reforming, wet sulfuric acid process).  The humidity will reduce the oxygen concentration, and the flue gas fans have to pull more air through the system to get the same firing rate (dry air is 20.9% oxygen, at 100% relative humidity the air is 20.4% oxygen).[27]', ""Sorry, it seems you were trying to access a page that doesn't exist. Please check the spelling of the URL you were trying to access and try again."", 'If you already know the meaning of ‘relative humidity’*\xa0you won’t need to refer to the paragraphs at the end of this post, either way I don’t think you will\xa0really need it, but it’s there just in case.\xa0All I know for certain is,\xa0everything is relative.\xa0My four days and five nights in Darwin were, relatively miserable, temperature-wise and humidity-wise–but otherwise, it was a good break, if by ‘good break’ you mean makes you really\xa0appreciate being home again. I decided some weeks ago to accompany my mostly sensible husband to Darwin while he participated in the NT Golf Open. I think he would agree with me in saying he didn’t actually compete, because competing would be another relative thing, as compared to endure, I suppose. Let’s just say he was not in the hunt for top honours.\xa0He did finish in front of\xa0 a handful of players out of the 200+ field so I suppose that is something.\xa0And more’s the pity, he did not even enjoy it. But I’m sure the next time he considers going to Darwin to play golf, the experience will immediately bring him to his senses. If not, he will have me to remind him, for which I’m sure he will be, not so much grateful as, annoyed. My plan was to catch up with friends. That was all. We usually stay in the city (small though it is) of Darwin, but this trip we decided to try a ‘boutique motel’ and hire a car. It was small, very small, but perfectly formed, save the very hard mattress; but good air conditioning and that was most important. Wipe that romantic notion about ceiling fans and mosquito nets being adequate in the tropics from your mind’s eye. That is just wrong. The suburb of Parap offers several cafés, restaurants, a gourmet food shop, a couple of gift shops and a gallery and a couple of other options, and a Saturday morning market that has always been a favourite, going way back to our days of living in Darwin. We saw the very first few stalls begin to trade about 30 years ago and it has steadily grown into a Darwin institution. Sadly, there is little food from the market I am able to eat these days, but wandering through at 7.30am, humidity at 93% and temperature at 26C (79F) was still worth it to grab a few photos. It was great to catch up with old friends and compare war stories. None of us escapes the ‘stuff’. Just as none of us will get out of this alive. We swap wisdom and compare treatments, catch up on our children and travels and before you know it the afternoon has slipped away. And at the end of the visit we always agree, we are relatively good. Lots of people we know are worse. Perhaps we are a tiny bit delusional too. We managed to take in a wonderful exhibition by paper artist, Winsome Jobling;\xa0and\xa0also to fit in a walk along the East Point foreshore, looking back at the city through Poinciana trees that have yet to gain their leaves and flowers because they have yet to get the dry season weather needed for that. It was hard work for me in the morning humidity.\xa0Later in the day I was ‘at one’ with that aforementioned hard mattress\xa0in the air conditioned motel room. To complain about the weather does nothing to improve it, but it was good to know it wasn’t only this desert dweller that was feeling the distress of extreme humidity where dry breezes should have been flowing. The locals were even feeling it. I gave up drinking hot coffee in preference\xa0to\xa0iced coffees, had two showers a day and had to hand wash undies and clothes because I forgot the ‘sweat factor’ of the top end when packing for a time when the dry season is not yet in full swing. We often remark that travel makes us appreciate home more, and this trip was especially true in that respect. But I wasn’t expecting what happened at the end. I arrived home and stepped off the plane onto the tarmac (there are no air bridges at Alice Springs airport) into a morning, post rain showers, where the humidity was exactly 93%, as it had been most of the mornings in Darwin, except that the temperature was 16C (60F), ten degrees below the Darwin temps in the early mornings. It felt glorious! And that, my friends, is the perfect illustration of relative humidity. As if blazoned on a neon sign atop the airport terminal it dawned on me, yet again,\xa0the wisdom of those three words\xa0‘everything is relative’. (*Here is what Uncle Wikipedia says about relative humidity...“Humans are sensitive to humidity because the human body uses evaporative cooling, enabled by perspiration, as the primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Perspiration evaporates from the skin more slowly under humid conditions than under arid conditions. Because humans perceive a low rate of heat transfer from the body to be equivalent to a higher air temperature,[3] the body experiences greater distress of waste heat burden at high humidity than at lower humidity, given equal temperatures. For example, if the air temperature is 24 °C (75 °F) and the relative humidity is zero percent, then the air temperature feels like 21 °C (69 °F).[4] If the relative humidity is 100 percent at the same air temperature, then it feels like 27 °C (80 °F).[4] In other words, if the air is 24 °C (75 °F) and contains saturated water vapor, then the human body cools itself at the same rate as it would if it were 27 °C (80 °F) and dry.[4] The heat index and the humidex are indices that reflect the combined effect of temperature and humidity on the cooling effect of the atmosphere on the human body.”) When do you visit Vietnam? My husband (who has never been there) keeps telling me it can be comfortable, depending on what time of year you go, but I am not convinced. I can’t help it, I feel very uncomfortable with much humidity in temps above about 22C. Yes, the tropical fruit in the Top End is amazing. My personal favourite, now that I can no longer eat Mango, is the red papaya, with a generous squeeze of lime juice over it. Delicious. I really hope the Dry Season is well entrenched when you visit. It makes all the difference. Good friends that we’ve had for a long time are so special. Don has just come in from golf this afternoon and stated “I’m glad to report I can still play golf, I wasn’t sure after last weekend.” Yes, ‘a good idea at the time’. Thanks Dale. Clearly, I can’t do the heat and humidity thing any longer either, Roger! Actually I was never very good with it but in my younger years I could tolerate it better. Yes, good idea to read blogs before traveling to places. If you get on to a good one it is very revealing. Thanks for reading. Heavens above Ardys, had no idea you had resided in Australia for all those years – somehow thought Alice Springs was your first ‘stop’ 🙂 !  Thank you for those fabulous photos of Darwin: a place the QANTAS planes used to touch down a long, long time ago in the early morning hours with the airport bars still full of drunken locals !!  Have not been past that myself, but have travelled to most of the Pacific Islands and been to Singapore more times than I can count . . . sure one does need heaps of spare clothes for changing, but the humidity never fazed me . . . I ‘blossom’ around 30-35 C tho’ don’t much care past the 40 mark!! My good friend loves the warmth but not the extreme humidity. She also blossoms in higher temps than myself. I lived in Darwin after we were married for 8.5 years and really enjoyed it all except the humidity. I’m sure in those days the temps up there were a couple of degrees cooler too, though still not cool exactly. My husband was there from 1973 until we came to Alice in 1992. He remembers it when it was wild and wooly! Thanks for reading Eha. Great post!  After living in Houston, Texas, I try not to complain about humidity here in Oklahoma.  But sometimes I just have to!! Gee, Texas is getting hammered with ‘moisture’ at the moment, too! Yes, I try not to complain too much about the weather as it does nothing to improve it and makes everyone around you miserable listening to you, but sometimes it just has to be said! Thank you for reading Mimi. I grew up in a very dry climate, so when I moved to Oklahoma in the southern US, I loved the humidity for my skin and hair. I have never lived in extreme humidity so I cannot say how I would handle that. But it is a wonderful thing to experience and observe all things and draw something positive from it. That is what I can count on from you, Ardys. You see things in a beautiful perspective, and your photography especially, showcases that! 🙂 My philosophy is to find the positive in things. It may not change the outcome, but it makes the journey so much nicer! Southern Ohio had its share of humidity but the Tropics is a different level again. I will return to Darwin to visit my friends but I will try and remember to take twice the number of cool clothes and undies next time!!! Thanks Lori, you’re a gem.xx So nice to hear from you again. Am about to settle down after a busy morning and read your much anticipated latest post. It’s pretty rare that my suffering doesn’t yield some good lesson or decent photo!

One is primarily used for the bridge navigation and positioning systems, and the other two are used for science. The system displayed here is a Gill MetPakPro, and measures Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed and Direction. Air Temperature is displayed in degrees Celsius. Barometric, or Atmospheric Pressure is the force exerted on the surface of the sensor by the air above the surface in the atmosphere of Earth. The data is given in a unit called hectoPascals, which is equivalent to the more common term, millibars. At sealevel, the barometric pressure is typically around 1013 hPA (or 1013 millibars). Severe storms often bring a lower pressure; for example a tropical cyclone, tornado, or waterspout might have a pressure of 870 mbars. It is therefore important to watch the Pressure reading for incoming storms. Relative Humidity is described as a percentage; it is the ratio of the amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold at its specific temperature and pressure to the amount of water vapor that is actually in the air. Humans are sensitive to relative humidity, because it affects the rate of evaporative cooling (perspiration) that the body can use to cool itself. A high humidity slows the rate at which perspiration evaporates from the skin, thus slowing the rate that the human body can cool itself.

An auto loan is a form of financing that allows an individual to purchase a car. The loan may be secured or unsecured, with unsecured loans usually offered by dealerships or banks. Oklahoma auto loans typically require the borrower to make monthly payments over a predetermined period to repay the loan amount. When applying for automotive loans, a person must provide personal and financial information such as proof of income, employment history, and credit score. This information will assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan and determine the loan's interest rate and other terms. Some lenders also offer special programs to help those with bad credit obtain loans. The loan amount will depend on the car's value and the borrower's creditworthiness. Generally, lenders require some collateral from borrowers, such as the title to the motor vehicle or money down, to secure the loan. Interest rates on auto loans vary depending on the length of repayment and the borrower's credit rating. Before signing for an auto loan, it's important to read all documents thoroughly and understand the terms and conditions. Knowing one's credit score, budgeting for potential increases in monthly payments, and understanding if an extended warranty is included in the loan are all important steps to take.

Get started now and take advantage of our flexible terms, competitive rates, and more! A: Online loans have several advantages over traditional lending options like banks and credit unions. Convenience, speed, accessibility, competitive rates, and transparency are among the benefits. In addition, online loans can be applied for from the comfort of your home, and loan decisions are frequently made quickly through automated systems. Online lenders may be more willing to work with borrowers with bad credit or who live in areas where traditional lenders do not have a physical presence. Due to lower overhead costs, online lenders may also offer lower interest rates and fees. In addition, they typically provide transparency in the lending process by providing upfront information on loan terms and fees. A: Yes, you can obtain a car loan even if you are currently unemployed. Some auto lenders will approve your loan without requiring you to have a job right now if you meet all of their other requirements. In addition to your employment history, lenders usually consider the following additional factors: If you don’t have evidence of employment-based income, you’ll most likely need to have excellent credit and make a substantial down payment. Depending on your credit score and job history, you may also need a co-signer for the loan. A: Comparing a network of lenders is beneficial for auto financing. It gives you access to multiple lenders, increases chances of approval, helps you find better interest rates and terms, saves time, and gives you the freedom to shop around without obligation. In addition, by comparing multiple lenders, you can quickly compare interest rates, loan terms, and fees to find the best deal for your specific financial situation and choose the best financing option for you. A: The monthly payments, interest rates, depreciation, and plans are some elements that affect a vehicle loan’s credit term. For example, long-term savings are typically realized with shorter loan terms due to reduced interest rates and quicker repayment. On the other hand, a longer loan period may make a more expensive vehicle more affordable and result in lower monthly payments. Finally, your unique financial circumstances and loan objectives will decide which loan term is best for you. A: Your ability to obtain auto financing relies on several variables, including your credit score, income, and the lender’s requirements. You might be qualified for financing a new or used car from a dealership or private seller if you have a good credit score and a reliable income. You might need to look into financing options with higher interest rates or work with a lender specializing in bad credit car loans if you have a low credit score or a limited income. It’s crucial to be aware that lenders might have limitations on the kind of car you can finance, depending on factors like the age, mileage, or state of the car. For instance, some lenders will only fund vehicles under 10 years old with less than 100,000 miles on them. To ensure you qualify for the kind of car you’re interested in buying, it’s always a good idea to study lenders and their requirements before applying for financing. A: A debt with simple interest has daily interest calculations. As you reduce the principal amount, the daily interest rate will drop. To calculate the daily interest charge, divide the interest rate percentage by 100. Then, subtract that amount from the total number of days in a year (365 or 366 for a leap year). This will determine your daily interest rate. A: Your credit history may reflect a late payment if your payment is 30 days or more past due. The effect of a late payment on your credit score depends on many variables, including the number of days past due, how recently you’ve been late, and how frequently you’ve been late. To remain informed of your situation, evaluate your credit report frequently.

With an estimated 3,617,316 residents in 2007[1] and a land area of 68,667 square miles, Oklahoma is the 28th most populous and 18th-largest state. The state\'s name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning ""red people"", and is known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State. Formed from the Indian Territory on November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.', 'Oklahoma is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state’s name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning “red people”. It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America’s Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, or informally “Okies”, and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. In 2007, it had one of the fastest-growing economies in the United States, ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth. Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma’s primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas. With small mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers and the U.S. Interior Highlands—a region especially prone to severe weather. In addition to having a prevalence of English, German, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, and Native American ancestry, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, third only to Alaska and California. Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives, a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans.

who plays queen lannister in game of thrones,"['Gary@BookCelebrities.com', 'Game of Thrones divides its cast-members into a three-tiered system, with the members of tier one receiving the highest salaries. The numbers are a little more hazy on the rest of the cast. The second rung on the ladder, which includes such actors as Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), among others, are said to have received large raises in recent negotiations as well. While previous estimates put at least the younger members of this group in the $55,000 per episode range ($550,000 per season), we wouldn’t be shocked to learn if they’ve all been bumped up to six figures an episode given the show’s mammoth popularity. Above: Beautiful Game Of Thrones British Actress Sophie Turner Modeling For The Cover Of The Edit (Net-A-Porter Magazine) Modeling As One Of The Highest Paid Actresses In The World. Game of Thrones biggest stars – see on this page – are rumoured to be paid $300,000 an episode (or $2.1 million per season) after negotiating new contracts for a seventh season. They united to negotiate a $1 million an episode deal (about $7 million for the season) for the 10th and final season. The contracts do not guarantee that the characters of the actors will stay alive in the series. As expected, Tier A, aka the highest-paid level, includes the show’s lead actors, including Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister). Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (aka Jaime Lannister) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) are also included in this tier. Though the exact number of their renegotiated salary was not revealed at the time, Deadline reported that all of the Tier A actors are currently paid close to $300,000 an episode. For Dinklage and Headey, who were making $160,000 per episode in Season 4, the pay bump marked a nearly 100% raise. Since there are ten episodes per a season, the actors in this tier (at least those who weren’t temporarily killed off) will end each season having made a cool $3,000,000. Again, these deals were struck ahead of Season 5. Update 6/22/16: After the show earned high ratings and critical acclaim in its recent seasons, the Game of Thrones stars are again asking for a significant pay bumps. According to Deadline, the above mentioned Tier A actors will now all be paid north of $500,000 an episode for Season 7, which has been officially picked up, and Season 8, which is widely expected. While the pay raise helps secure the key cast for the series’ final run, it reportedly doesn’t guarantee that all five characters will survive til the show’s last episodes. Meanwhile, speculation is that both Season 7 and Season 8 will be shorter than previous seasons, possibly seven episodes for the former and six episodes for the latter. Per THR, the lower-salaried “B” tier includes co-stars Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and several others who remain unnamed. Of the names including in this tier, Williams is probably the most surprising, as her character Arya is a fan favorite and widely considered a staple of the show. However, some reports suggest that her younger age could have been a factor in knocking her down to the second tier. Though their salaries were not revealed at the time, THR reports that all of Tier B also scored raises in the 2014 negotiations (albeit smaller ones than those in Tier A). In return, these actors also extended their contracts through Season 7. What about the rest of the cast not included in Tier or Tier B? Per THR, there is reportedly also a third tier of regular actors who received much smaller pay increases during negotiations. Mother of dollars: Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys Targaryen, is in the top tier. No wonder he repays his debts: The show’s lead actors, such as Peter Dinklage, now earn roughly $US300,000 per episode. The stars of the Emmy-winning drama are in line to receive hefty salary raises for the likely eighth and potentially final season of the fantasy drama based on the books by George R.R. Martin, sources confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. Due to score sizable pay bumps are leads Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister). They’ll each earn upward of $500,000 per episode of season seven, which has already been announced, and in the likely eighth season (which is all but a formality). The raises for season seven come as part of an option HBO had with the cast as part of their last deal, signed in October 2014, that saw the five stars each become among the highest-paid actors on cable TV. The premium cable network had the option on season seven, and that has now been exercised and packaged with season eight. While the five stars are locked in, it does not guarantee that their characters will survive through what is expected to be the end of the series. HBO declined comment on the salary bumps. Season eight has not yet been announced but is wildly expected as the drama, from showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss is, in their words, “approaching the finish line.” The duo told THR ahead of the current sixth season — which wraps Sunday — that they are “writing the final act” and are “looking at somewhere between 70 and 75 hours before the credits roll for the last time.” Also unclear are just how many episodes seasons seven and eight will consist of. When season six wraps this weekend, Thrones will have aired 60 episodes, meaning the remaining two seasons could be short-orders to match the 75 hours producers have envisioned. The contracts of the remaining stars, including Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and others, has not yet been completed. Their last deal, in October 2014, also saw them net hefty raises with an option for season seven. Game of Thrones ranks as HBO’s most-watched series ever and is the premium outlet’s longest-running show currently on the air. But not in the way book readers were hoping, unfortunately. The season six finale borrows its title from the sixth novel in George R.R. Martin’s series — a book that remains unpublished. As such, Thrones veered away from the books during season six, and in many cases even revealed plot points ahead of Martin’s pace. (Here’s looking at you, Hodor.) The words “Winds of Winter” carry significant weight for fans of both Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire, serving as both a powerful sign of things to come, and a painful reminder of the book’s continued delay. The wait between seasons can be brutal. Though it seems a faraway memory now, Jon Snow’s death in the season five finale slammed into fans like a ton of ice bricks dropping from the top of the Wall. Will season six end on a similarly painful and even maddening cliffhanger? That’s unknown for now. What is known, however, is the fact that Thrones is closer than ever to its conclusion. Showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss have expressed their intent to end the series soon, with some debate about the exact amount of episodes remaining. “In the beginning, we hoped that if the show worked, we’d get seven seasons to tell the tale. Seven kingdoms, seven gods, seven books — seven felt like a lucky number,” Benioff and Weiss told THR ahead of season six. “The actual messiness of storytelling might not be quite that numerologically elegant, but we’re looking at somewhere between 70 and 75 hours before the credits roll for the last time.” Emilia Isabelle Euphemia Rose Clarke[1][2] (born 23 October 1986[3]) is an English actress. She is best known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in the HBO series Game of Thrones, for which she received two Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2013 and 2015. Clarke made her Broadway debut in a production of Breakfast at Tiffany’s as Holly Golightly in March 2013. In 2015, she starred as Sarah Connor in the film Terminator Genisys. She was named Esquire’s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015. Sophie Turner (born 21 February 1996) is an English actress. Turner made her professional acting debut as Sansa Stark on the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones (2011-present), which brought her international recognition and critical praise. For her performance, she has received four nominations for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, as well as a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Supporting Young Actress in a TV Series. Turner has also starred in the television film The Thirteenth Tale (2013) and she made her feature film debut in Another Me (2013). She has also starred in the action comedy Barely Lethal (2015) and played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). Season six of Game of Thrones might be over, but you can relive the early glory of the Starks and the North with this very excellent audition tape of Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams trying out for the roles of Sansa and Arya Stark, respectively, nearly six years ago. The video clip splices two different audition clips of the actresses from 2010, where each reads opposite parts from the same scene (presumably with a line reader for the video); however, with the editing, it appears that the two girls are speaking to one another, despite the fact that the footage was taken separately. Lena Headey (born 3 October 1973) is a British actress. After being scouted at age 17, Headey worked steadily as an actress in small and supporting roles in films throughout the 1990s, before finding fame for her lead performances in big-budget films such as the fantasy film The Brothers Grimm (2005), the action film 300 (2007), portraying Gorgo, Queen of Sparta, and the adventure and biographical film The Red Baron (2008). Headey is best known for portraying Queen Cersei Lannister in HBO’s hit fantasy series Game of Thrones since 2011, a performance that has earned her two consecutive Emmy award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. She is also known for playing the titular character Sarah Connor on Fox’s Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and the villainous drug lord Madeline “Ma-Ma” Madrigal in Dredd. Margaret Constance “Maisie” Williams[1] (born 15 April 1997) is an English actress. She made her professional acting debut as Arya Stark in the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones, for which she won the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama, the Portal Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television and Best Young Actor, and the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. Williams has also had a recurring role in Doctor Who as Ashildr in 2015. In addition to television, she made her feature film debut in the mystery The Falling, for which she won the London Film Critics’ Circle Award for Young Performer of the Year. Natalie Dormer (born 11 February 1982) is an English actress. She became known for her roles as Anne Boleyn on the Showtime series The Tudors (2007–10), as Margaery Tyrell on the HBO series Game of Thrones (2012–16), Irene Adler on the CBS series Elementary (2013–15), and as Cressida in the science-fiction adventure films The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015). She has been nominated for Best Performance at the Gemini Awards for her work in The Tudors. She has also been nominated for a Screen Actor’s Guild Award for her performance in Game of Thrones. “From the moment she came in, she was on it: She was professional, and she was just brilliant,” actor Liam Cunningham says of the Lady of Bear Island. Jon Snow’s mother isn’t the only important Lyanna in the North, and not even the only important Lyanna of “The Winds of Winter,” the final installment of Game of Thrones’ eventful sixth season. Near the end of the episode, Lord Snow attempts to solidify the North behind his cause against the White Walkers, but his pleas fall on deaf ears. The tide only turns after a rousing speech from Lyanna Mormont, the Lady of Bear Island, no more than 10 years old and in command of no more than 62 soldiers — at least that’s the number she gives Jon back in “The Broken Man,” but no telling how the figure has adjusted in the wake of “Battle of the Bastards.” “Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly, but you refused the call,” she says, the ice-cold toughness of a world-weary warrior in her young voice. “You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refused the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day.” From there, it’s a short leap before all those in attendance lift their arms in favor of Jon Snow, King in the North, the White Wolf of Winterfell — and on the other side of the television, more than a few million viewers were pumping their own fists in support of Lady Mormont, rallying an entire region of Westeros more effectively than Jon Snow himself. Indeed, while she’s not serving Frey pies, Lady Mormont delivers the show’s version of one of George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire books’ most iconic lines: “The North remembers.” Lord Manderly owns this line in the source material; on the show, not only do those words belong to Lady Mormont, she pairs them with an epic tongue-lashing toward Manderly and his fellow Northerners. It’s not just the character on Game of Thrones and fans at home who were impressed with the ruler of Bear Islands, either. The cast and crew on hand for actress Bella Ramsey’s scenes were similarly impressed by the young star’s work. “From the moment she came in, she was on it: She was professional, and she was just brilliant,” Liam Cunningham, who plays Davos Seaworth, told THR about working with Ramsey during the season. “There’s an old adage about how actors should never work with children or animals, but that’s B.S. When kids are as good as this young lady is, it’s a joy to play opposite. She was absolutely amazing. When somebody comes in and is that good, it makes your job that much easier.” Mark Mylod, who directed Ramsey’s Game of Thrones debut in “The Broken Man,” remembers shooting the character’s first scene and immediately recognizing her instant hit status. “She walked in for the casting reading, and we were knocked completely sideways. It was one of those moments where you go, ‘Oh my God, what a star.’ You could not wish to meet a more delightful young lady. It was a four-and-a-half-page scene where we first meet that character, with Jon, Sansa and Davos all meeting her on Bear Island. We had a rehearsal day, and I think we were shooting midweek. The cast agreed to come in on their day off to work with this young actor, Bella. She’s so young that she still works on child hours, so we had a limited amount of time with her. We knew we had to work fast, and she had so much dialogue, as you may remember from the scene. We all came in on a Saturday morning to the set, and everyone was having a jolly day, thinking we would be coaxing this shy young child through the scene. We all had kid gloves on for the day. “After the first rehearsal, I remember thinking, ‘OK, this is going to be a very short rehearsal. She’s note perfect.’ The accent was awesome, her inflection and her professionalism. … We ended up rehearsing for only a half hour because she was so on it,” Mylod continued. “And of course, the rest of us felt deeply ashamed, because she knew every single word and every single inflection. We all went home feeling a bit deflated. (Laughs.) But also excited! Because the level of talent there is so ridiculous. She’s someone we’re going to look back on in 20 years, and she’s going to be ruling Hollywood. She’s just amazing.” Game of Thrones season six has been nothing short of exciting and revolutionary for the hit HBO fantasy series. But as it draws to a close this weekend (26 June), we’ll find ourselves a little lost on Sunday nights and finally forced to tackle the ironing pile. The newest season of GoT could not possibly top the last, but this one has gone and done just that. We’ve witnessed Sansa Stark’s escape – threatening her husband Ramsay Bolton’s status as heir to the North – before she lets him be devoured by his own dogs at the sensational Battle of the Bastards. Prior to that, Melisandre successfully resurrected Jon Snow after performing a bizarre ritual on him, and Daenerys Targaryen is brought to Vaes Dothrak to live out her days with the Dosh Khaleen having been captured by the khalasar. Jaime Lannister returned to King’s Landing with Myrcella Baratheon’s corpse and Bran Stark made good use out of his time travelling skills, amongst many other highlights throughout the season. But what about the numbers from season six? Take a look at the interesting figures behind the globally successful franchise. $10m: Was the cost of each episode of GoT – mounting to $100m for the season as a whole. 3: Was the amount of episodes it took for Jon Snow to be resurrected; he gasped his first breath at the end of episode three after being killed by several men of the Night’s Watch in the season five finale. 85,000: is the approximate number of people that have rated episode nine – the Battle of the Bastards – as the highest-rated TV episode of all time on IMDb. $500,000: Is the estimated amount of money that several main characters in GoT will now receive per episode for season 7. These are: Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Lena Headey (Cersei Lanniester), Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister). 5: Characters predicted to live throughout season 7 and eight – which are the above-mentioned. 5: Ladies who are doing it for themselves, and giving GoT a good dose of girl power in contrast to previous seasons. These empowered females are: Sansa Stark, Daenerys Targaryen, Yara Greyjoy, Arya Stark and 10-year-old Lyanna Mormont. 6: Countries season 6 filmed on location. These were Spain, Northern Ireland, Croatia, Iceland and Canada. 3: Is the amount of appearances Daenerys’ dragons made. 1: Battle was had, and that was the epic Battle of the Bastards.

the stone tools associated with neandertal populations were first identified at the site of,"['', 'The new trailer for War for the Planet of the Apes is here and it looks like apes and humans won’t be signing a peace treaty any time soon. The third installment of the modern Planet of the Apes franchise will feature Caesar and his fellow super-smart primates going head-to-head with a human army intent on reclaiming Earth. “The irony is we created you and nature has been punishing ever since,” says Woody Harrelson, whose character only goes by Colonel. “This is our last stand. And if we lose, it will be a planet of apes.” In War for the Planet of the Apes, humans refuse to be the subservient species to primates. The solution to this conflict of competition — as the trailer and the not-so-subtle movie title makes out — appears to be war. To a student of biology, this should make perfect sense: The plot of the movie is just a drawn-out metaphor for Gause’s Law, the idea that two species that compete for the exact same resources cannot stably exist. A quick recap on the franchise: In Rise of the Planet of the Apes we’re introduced to a chimp named Caesar whose mother was given an experimental retrovirus called ALZ-112, developed as a cure for Alzheimer’s disease. This formula caused Caesar’s intelligence to greatly increase. However, its next iteration, ALZ-113, proved to also increase the intelligence of chimps while being incredibly lethal to humans. And by the time this third movie rolls around, 99 percent of the human population has died while Caesar and his comrades have built a civilization of their own. What happens now is a competition for survival. Caesar is captured by the Colonel. This is where Gause’s Law comes in, illustrating the evolutionary case for competitive exclusion. It’s generally accepted that one of two competitors will have at least a slight advantage over the other. This leads to one of two results — either the disadvantaged becomes extinct or experiences an evolutionary shift that will allow it to coexist. The primates and humans in Planet of the Apes are competing for the same resources and overall domination, an event that — as per the film’s synopsis — “will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.” Competitive exclusion is also thought to explain a real world battle that leads to extinction. Some scientists argue that it was not climate change that led to the extinction of Neanderthals, but rather competition with Homo sapiens, anatomically modern humans. Neanderthals lived in Europe and Southwest Asia from at least 130,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago. Their “disappearance” happened around the same time as modern humans and they are thought to have migrated to Europe from Africa. In PLOS One a team of international researchers make the case that this disappearance was really extinction by means of competitive exclusion. What exactly entailed competition is debated — it’s thought that advanced brains gave them the advantage of forming better social groups and technologically superior weaponry, giving them a leg up on competition for resources. There’s also the thought that our ancient ancestors warred with their Neanderthal neighbors — exactly what’s playing out in this iteration of Planet of the Apes. This idea is less popular among anthropologists, but in 2009, researchers from Paris’s Centre National de La Réchereche Scientifique claimed they found fossil evidence that Neanderthals had been butchered and eaten. Of course, extinction here is a tricky word. While it’s typically said that Neanderthals are extinct — their species, exactly as they were, certainly doesn’t live today — it’s also known that Homo sapiens hooked up with them and interbred. Today it’s thought that everyone whose ancestry is from outside of Africa has a bit of Neanderthal DNA in their genes. And that brings us to the second result of Gause’s Law: a shift that allows the lesser species to exist. Maybe it will be a bit of interspecies romance a la the 1968 Planet of the Apes that will ensure the survival of a species, rather than war?', 'Homo neaderthalensis lived in Western Asia and Europe at the same time as Homo sapiens. The morphology and brain size of Neanderthals is comparable with modern humans, but certain features of Neanderthal anatomy, such as a large nose and a robust skeleton, may be adaptations to Ice Age climates. Unlike modern humans, Neanderthals have an occipital bun. Neanderthal burials show evidence of cultural treatment of the dead. H. neanderthalensis was replaced by successive radiations of H. sapiens into Europe. Recent studies suggests that the two species were able to successfully interbreed. The type specimen for H. neanderthalensis is Neanderthal 1 from the Neander Valley in Germany.

They are known from numerous fossils, as well as stone tool assemblages. Almost all assemblages younger than 160,000 years are of the so-called Mousterian techno-complex, which is characterised by tools made out of stone flakes. The type specimen is Neanderthal 1, found in Neander Valley in the German Rhineland, in 1856."

The forty-third tropical depression,nineteenth tropical storm,twelfth typhoon,and third super typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season,Tip developed out of a disturbance within the monsoon trough on October\xa04 near Pohnpei in Micronesia. Initially,Tropical Storm Roger to the northwest hindered the development and motion of Tip,though after the storm tracked farther north,Tip was able to intensify. After passing Guam,Tip rapidly intensified and reached peak sustained winds of 305\xa0km/h (190\xa0mph) [nb 1]  and a worldwide record-low sea-level pressure of 870\xa0 hPa  (25.69\xa0 inHg ) on October\xa012. At its peak intensity,Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record,with a wind diameter of 2,220\xa0km (1,380\xa0mi). Tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast,in response to an approaching trough. The typhoon made landfall in southern Japan on October\xa019,and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. Tip's extratropical remnants continued moving east-northeastward,until they dissipated near the Aleutian Islands on October 24. U.S. Air Force aircraft flew 60\xa0 weather reconnaissance missions into the typhoon,making Tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones. [1]  Rainfall from Tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13\xa0 Marines and injured 68 at Combined Arms Training Center,Camp Fuji in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan. [2]  Elsewhere in the country,the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42\xa0deaths;offshore shipwrecks left 44\xa0people killed or missing. At the end of September 1979, three circulations developed within the monsoon trough that extended from the Philippines to the Marshall Islands. The westernmost disturbance developed into a tropical depression on October 1, to the west of Luzon, which would later become Typhoon Sarah on October 7. [3]  On October\xa03, the disturbance southwest of Guam developed into Tropical Storm Roger, and later on the same day, a third tropical disturbance that would later become Typhoon Tip formed south of Pohnpei. Strong flow from across the equator was drawn into Roger's wind circulation, initially preventing significant development of the precursor disturbance to Tip. Despite the unfavorable air pattern, the tropical disturbance gradually organized as it moved westward. Due to the large-scale circulation pattern of Tropical Storm Roger, Tip's precursor moved erratically and slowly executed a cyclonic loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system late on October\xa04 confirmed the existence of a closed low-level circulation, and early on October\xa05, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression Twenty-Three-W. [1] While executing another loop near Chuuk, the tropical depression intensified into Tropical Storm Tip, though the storm failed to organize significantly due to the influence of Tropical Storm Roger. Reconnaissance aircraft provided the track of the surface circulation, since satellite imagery estimated the center was about 60\xa0km (37\xa0mi) from its true position. After drifting erratically for several days, Tip began a steady northwest motion on October\xa08. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone, resulting in the southerly flow to be entrained into Tip. An area of a tropical upper tropospheric trough moved north of Guam at the time, providing an excellent outflow channel north of Tip. Initially, Tip was predicted to continue northwestward and make landfall on Guam, though instead, it turned to the west early on October\xa09, passing about 45\xa0km (28\xa0mi) south of Guam. Later that day, Tip intensified to attain typhoon status. [1] Owing to very favorable conditions for development, Typhoon Tip rapidly intensified over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. Late on October\xa010, Tip attained wind speeds equal to Category\xa04 strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS), and it became a super typhoon on the next day. The central pressure dropped by 92\xa0 hPa  (2.72\xa0inHg) from October\xa09 to 11, during which the circulation pattern of Typhoon Tip expanded to a record diameter of 2,220\xa0km (1,380\xa0mi). Tip continued to intensify further, becoming a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon, and early on October\xa012, reconnaissance aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of 870\xa0mbar (870.0\xa0hPa; 25.69\xa0inHg) with 1-minute sustained winds of 305\xa0km/h (190\xa0mph), when Tip was located about 840\xa0km (520\xa0mi) west-northwest of Guam. [1]  In its best track, the Japan Meteorological Agency listed Tip as peaking with 10-minute sustained winds of 160\xa0mph (260\xa0km/h). [4]  At the time of its peak strength, its eye was 15\xa0km (9.3\xa0mi) wide. [1]  Tip crossed the 135th meridian east on the afternoon of October\xa013, prompting the PAGASA to issue warnings on Typhoon Tip, assigning it the local name Warling. [1]  [5] After peaking in intensity, Tip weakened to 230\xa0km/h (145\xa0mph) and remained at that intensity for several days, as it continued west-northwestward. For five days after its peak strength, the average radius of winds stronger than 55\xa0km/h (35\xa0mph) extended over 1,100\xa0km (684\xa0mi). On October\xa017, Tip began to weaken steadily and decrease in size, recurving northeastward under the influence of a mid-level trough the next day. After passing about 65\xa0km (40\xa0mi) east of Okinawa, the typhoon accelerated to 75\xa0km/h (45\xa0mph). Tip made landfall on the Japanese island of Honshū with winds of about 130\xa0km/h (80\xa0mph) on October\xa019. It continued rapidly northeastward through the country and became an extratropical cyclone over northern Honshū a few hours after moving ashore. [1]  The extratropical remnant of Tip proceeded east-northeastward and gradually weakened, crossing the International Date Line on October\xa022. The storm was last observed near the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October 24. [4] The typhoon produced heavy rainfall early in its lifetime while passing near Guam, including a total of 23.1\xa0cm (9.1\xa0in) at Andersen Air Force Base. [1]  Gusts of 125\xa0km/h (80\xa0mph) were measured during October 9 at the Naval Base Guam, as the center of the storm was positioned 70\xa0km (43\xa0mi) south of Agana. Tip caused a total loss of nearly US$1.6 million across Guam. [8]  The outer rainbands of the large circulation of Tip produced moderate rainfall in the mountainous regions of the Philippine islands of Luzon and Visayas. [9]  Total damages associated with Tip in Japan were estimated as  ¥105.7 billion (US$482.34\xa0million). [10] Heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. [11]  Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts situated at the base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. [12]  [13]  [14]  The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, [1]  and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, [11]  along with fifteen huts and several other structures. [12]  [15]  The barracks were rebuilt, [11]  and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire. [12] During recurvature, Typhoon Tip passed about 65\xa0km (40\xa0mi) east of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72\xa0km/h (45\xa0mph), with gusts to 112\xa0km/h (70\xa0mph). Sustained wind velocities in Japan are not known, though they were estimated at minimal typhoon strength. The passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in millions of dollars in damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country. [1]  Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44\xa0fishermen dead or unaccounted for. A Chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon, though its crew of 46 were rescued. [9]  The rainfall led to over 600\xa0 mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of Japan and flooded more than 22,000\xa0homes; 42\xa0people died throughout the country, with another 71\xa0missing and 283\xa0injured. [9]  River embankments broke in 70 places, destroying 27 bridges, while about 105 dikes were destroyed. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left homeless. Tip destroyed apple, rice, peach and other crops. Five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50-story buildings swayed in the capital, Tokyo. [16]  [17]  Transportation in the country was disrupted; 200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled. [18]  Tip was described as the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years. [19] Typhoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 1,380\xa0mi (2,220\xa0km)—almost double the previous record of 700\xa0mi (1,130\xa0km) in diameter set by Typhoon Marge in August 1951. [20]  [21]  [22]  At its largest, Tip was nearly half the size of the contiguous United States. [23]  The temperature inside the eye of Typhoon Tip at peak intensity was 30\xa0 °C  (86\xa0 °F ) and described as exceptionally high. [1]  With 10-minute sustained winds of 160\xa0mph (260\xa0km/h), Typhoon Tip is the strongest cyclone in the complete tropical cyclone listing by the Japan Meteorological Agency. [4] The typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone on record, with a pressure of 870\xa0mbar (25.69\xa0inHg), 5\xa0mbar (0.15\xa0inHg) lower than the previous record set by Super Typhoon June in 1975. [1]  [24]  [25]  The records set by Tip still technically stand, though with the end of routine reconnaissance aircraft flights in the western Pacific Ocean in August 1987, modern researchers have questioned whether Tip indeed remains the strongest. After a detailed study, three researchers determined that two typhoons, Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992, registered higher Dvorak numbers than Tip, and concluded that one or both of the two may have therefore been more intense. [26]  Other recent storms may have also been more intense than Tip at its peak; for instance, satellite-derived intensity estimates for Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 indicated that its core pressure may have been as low as 858\xa0mbar (25.34\xa0inHg). [27]  Due to the dearth of direct observations and Hurricane hunters into these cyclones, conclusive data is lacking. [26]  In October 2015, Hurricane Patricia reached an estimated peak intensity of 872 millibars (25.8\xa0inHg), with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 345\xa0km/h (215\xa0mph), making Patricia the second-most intense tropical cyclone recorded worldwide. However, the NHC noted in their report on the cyclone that Patricia may have surpassed Tip at the time of its peak intensity, as it was undergoing rapid intensification; however, due to the lack of direct aircraft observations at the time of the storm's peak, this possibility cannot be determined. [28] Despite the typhoon's intensity and damage, the name Tip was not retired and was reused in 1983, 1986, and 1989. [4]  The name was discontinued from further use in 1989, when the JTWC changed their naming list. [29] The 1992 Pacific typhoon season had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1992. Despite this, most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The 1979 Pacific typhoon season featured the largest and most intense tropical cyclone recorded globally, Typhoon Tip. The season also experienced slightly above-average tropical cyclone activity. The season had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1979, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The 1961 Pacific typhoon season had no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1961, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The 1957 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1957, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The 1951 Pacific typhoon season was a generally below average season with multiple tropical cyclones striking the Philippines. With the exception of January, each month saw at least one tropical system develop; October was the most active month with four tropical cyclones forming. Overall, there were 21\xa0tropical depressions, of which 17\xa0became named storms; of those, there were 16\xa0typhoons. Super Typhoon Nancy, also known as the 2nd Muroto Typhoon, was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone of the 1961 Pacific typhoon season and one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. The system possibly had the strongest winds ever measured in a tropical cyclone, with 345\xa0km/h (215\xa0mph) winds, tied with Hurricane Patricia of 2015. Nancy caused extensive damage, as well as at least 202 deaths and nearly 5,000 injuries in Japan and elsewhere, in September 1961. Typhoon Rose, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Uring, was the most violent and intense tropical cyclone to strike Hong Kong since Typhoon Wanda in 1962. The 21st named storm of the 1971 Pacific typhoon season, Rose developed from an area of disturbed weather while west of Guam on August\xa09. Moving west-northwestward, the storm briefly became a typhoon on the following day. After weakening to a tropical storm on August\xa011, Rose re-intensified into a typhoon several hours later. The system then curved westward and reached a primary peak intensity with winds of 205\xa0km/h (127\xa0mph) on August\xa013. Later that day, the typhoon made landfall near Palanan, Isabela in the Philippines. Rose weakened significantly while crossing the island of Luzon and was a minimal typhoon upon reaching the South China Sea on August\xa014. Typhoon Roy, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Asiang, was the second-most intense January tropical cyclone on record in the Western Pacific basin. Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on January 7, 1988, Roy quickly intensified as it moved through the Marshall Islands. By January 9, the storm intensified into a typhoon and attained its peak intensity the following day. At its peak, sustained winds reached 215\xa0km/h (135\xa0mph). Slight weakening took place before the storm moved through the Mariana Islands. Continuing westward, the system eventually struck the Philippines as a minimal typhoon before dissipating over the South China Sea on January 19. Typhoon Gay, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Seniang, was the strongest and longest-lasting storm of the 1992 Pacific typhoon season and most intense globally in 1992. It formed on November\xa014 near the International Date Line from a monsoon trough, which also spawned two other systems. Typhoon Gay later moved through the Marshall Islands as an intensifying typhoon, and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 295\xa0km/h (183\xa0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 872\xa0mb (25.8\xa0inHg). However, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205\xa0km/h (127\xa0mph), with a pressure of 900\xa0mbar (27\xa0inHg). Gay weakened rapidly after peaking because of interaction with another typhoon, and it struck Guam with winds of 160\xa0km/h (99\xa0mph) on November\xa023. The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming extratropical south of Japan on November\xa030. Typhoon Andy, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Iliang, was an intense tropical cyclone that made landfall in Taiwan. Andy formed along the northern edge of the monsoon trough south of Guam on July\xa022, 1982. It became a tropical storm the next day, although this system was initially poorly organized. Andy moved steadily west during the first few days of its life. After looping south of Guam, the cyclone moved northwest and strengthened. Andy turned westward near the 18th parallel on July\xa025. The system became a strong typhoon for a prolonged period on July\xa027 and July\xa028 while attaining a peak intensity of 185\xa0km/h (115\xa0mph). However, the typhoon struck southern Taiwan on July\xa029. Continuing westward through the Formosa Strait, the storm made its final landfall in southern China on July\xa030 and dissipated inland two days later. Typhoon Ida, also known as the Kanogawa Typhoon, was the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit Japan, as well as one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record. On September\xa020, Ida formed in the Western Pacific near Guam. It moved to the west and rapidly intensified into a 115\xa0mph (185\xa0km/h) typhoon by the next day. On September\xa022, Ida turned to the north and continued its quick rate of intensification. Two days later, the Hurricane Hunters observed a minimum barometric pressure of 877\xa0mb (25.9\xa0inHg), as well as estimated peak winds of 325\xa0km/h (202\xa0mph). This made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone on record at the time, although it was surpassed by Typhoon June 17\xa0years later. Ida weakened as it continued to the north-northeast, and made landfall in Japan on southeastern Honshū with winds of 80\xa0mph on September\xa026. It became extratropical the next day, and dissipated on the 28th to the east of the country. Ida caused torrential flooding to southeastern Japan, resulting in over 1,900\xa0mudslides. Damage was estimated at $50\xa0million, and there were 1,269\xa0fatalities. Super Typhoon Yuri was the most intense tropical cyclone in 1991 in terms of minimum central pressure. The nineteenth typhoon and final super typhoon of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Yuri was a tropical disturbance that strengthened into a tropical depression on November 22 in the Philippine Sea. Moving rather slowly at first, the system continued to intensify, and was given the name Yuri. It had become a severe tropical storm about 1,480\xa0kilometers east of Truk Island and took on a west-northwestward track at 22\xa0km/h. Typhoon intensity was attained that night when Yuri was 1,050\xa0km. Yuri turned more to the west on 26 November and reached peak intensity the following morning packing winds of over 220\xa0km/h near its centre. Moving northwestwards at 30\xa0km/h, Yuri passed 140\xa0km to the south-southwest of Guam on the evening of November 27. After recurving November 29, Yuri accelerated northeastwards on November 30 and weakened to a severe tropical storm that night. By the morning of December 1, it had degenerated into a tropical storm about a few hundred kilometers east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Extratropical transition was completed soon afterward, and the storm's remnants persisted until December 3. Typhoon Nora, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Luming, was the fourth-most intense tropical cyclone on record. Originating from an area of low pressure over the western Pacific, Nora was first identified as a tropical depression on October\xa02, 1973. Tracking generally westward, the system gradually intensified, attaining typhoon status the following evening. After turning northwestward, the typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification, during which its central pressure decreased by 77\xa0mb in 24\xa0hours. At the end of this phase, Nora peaked with winds of 295\xa0km/h (185\xa0mph) and a pressure of 875\xa0mb, making it the most-intense tropical cyclone on record at the time; however, this pressure has since been surpassed by Typhoon June, Typhoon Tip and Hurricane Patricia. The typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached the Philippines. After brushing Luzon on October\xa07, the system passed south of Taiwan and ultimately made landfall in China on October\xa010. Once onshore, Nora quickly weakened and dissipated the following day. Typhoon Sally, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Maring was an intense tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage across southeastern Asia, particularly in China, in September 1996. Forming well east of the Philippines on September\xa05, Sally quickly intensified as it tracked westward within favorable conditions. The system reached tropical storm intensity several hours after tropical cyclogenesis was completed, and strengthened further into typhoon intensity the following day. On September\xa07, Sally reached super typhoon status shortly before attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 260\xa0km/h (160\xa0mph) and a barometric pressure of 940\xa0mbar. Quickly moving across the South China Sea, Sally substantially weakened but remained a strong typhoon before making its first landfall on the Leizhou Peninsula on September\xa09. The tropical cyclone's trek brought it briefly over the Gulf of Tonkin before making a final landfall near the border of China and Vietnam. The typhoon rapidly deteriorated inland and dissipated later that day. Typhoon Haiyan's meteorological history began with its origins as a tropical disturbance east-southeast of Pohnpei and lasted until its degeneration as a tropical cyclone over southern China. The thirteenth typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November\xa02. Tracking generally westward, environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression the following day. After becoming a tropical storm and attaining the name Haiyan at 0000\xa0UTC on November\xa04, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 1800\xa0UTC on November\xa05. By November\xa06, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system as a Category\xa05-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after attaining this strength. Typhoon Joan was an intense typhoon that caused minor damages in relative to the strength of the typhoon. Joan was the strongest typhoon of 1959 Pacific typhoon season, and one of the most intense Pacific typhoons on record. Joan formed from a surface center to the northeast of Guam on August 23, in which Japan Meteorological Agency began to track and classify the system as a tropical depression on the next day. A reconnaissance aircraft was sent to investigate the surface center and in 03:25 UTC on August 25 the surface center was classified as a tropical storm by Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm rapidly intensified into a typhoon in the same day it was formed. By the next three days as Joan tracks towards Taiwan, Joan explosively intensified to attain peak intensity with the pressure of 885 millibars (26.1\xa0inHg), which is tied with Nina as the most intense Pacific typhoon on the record at the time. Shortly afterwards, Joan attained peak strength as a Category\xa05 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 165 knots (190\xa0mph) before making landfall in Taiwan as a 160 knots (180\xa0mph) typhoon, which was according to JTWC is the strongest landfall in the recorded history at the time. After making landfall, Joan weakened into a 110 knots (130\xa0mph) typhoon before making landfall on Fujian, China as a Category\xa02 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 95 knots (109\xa0mph). Once onshore, Joan did not degenerate quickly as Joan remained as a tropical cyclone for about one day before transitioning into a extratropical cyclone in 18:00 UTC of August 31. Extratropical remnants of Joan quickly traversed through South Korea and Japan before being last noted on 18:00 UTC, September 2. Typhoon Kim, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Osang, was the second typhoon in a week to directly affect the Philippines during July\xa01980. Like Typhoon Joe, Kim formed from the near equatorial monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean on July\xa019. The disturbance tracked quickly westward-northwest underneath a subtropical ridge, reaching tropical storm strength on the July\xa021 and typhoon strength on July\xa023. After developing an eye, Kim began to rapidly intensify, and during the afternoon of July\xa024, peaked in intensity as a super typhoon. Several hours later, Kim made landfall over the Philippines, but the storm had weakened considerably by this time. Throughout the Philippines, 40\xa0people were killed, 2 via drownings, and 19,000 others were directly affected. A total of 12,000\xa0homes were destroyed and 5,000\xa0villages were flooded. Less than a week earlier, the same areas were affected by Joe; however, Kim was considered the more damaging of the two typhoons. Land interaction took its toll on Kim, and upon entering the South China Sea, the storm was down below typhoon intensity. Kim continued northwestward but its disrupted circulation prevented re-intensification, and it remained a tropical storm until hitting southern China July\xa027 to the northeast of Hong Kong, where only slight damage was reported. Later that day, Kim dissipated. Hurricane Patricia was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere and the second-most intense worldwide in terms of barometric pressure. It also featured the highest one-minute maximum sustained winds ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec in mid-October\xa02015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October\xa020. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October\xa022. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category\xa05 hurricane in just 24\xa0hours—a near-record pace. The magnitude of intensification was poorly forecast and both forecast models and meteorologists suffered from record-high prediction errors. Typhoon Meranti, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Ferdie, was one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. Impacting the Batanes in the Philippines, Taiwan, as well as Fujian Province in September 2016, Meranti formed as a tropical depression on September 8 near the island of Guam. Tracking to the west northwest, Meranti gradually intensified until September 11, at which point it began a period of rapid intensification. Continuing to rapidly intensify, it became a super typhoon early on September 12, as it passed through the Luzon Strait, ultimately reaching its peak intensity on September 13 with 1-minute sustained winds of 315\xa0km/h (195\xa0mph). Shortly afterwards, it passed directly over the island of Itbayat. Meranti passed to the south of Taiwan as a super typhoon, and began weakening steadily as a result of land interaction. By September 15, it struck Fujian Province as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, becoming the strongest typhoon on record to impact the province. Upon moving inland, rapid weakening ensued and Meranti became extratropical the next day, dissipating shortly afterwards after it passed to the south of the Korean Peninsula. Typhoon Hagibis, known in Japan as Typhoon No.19 or Reiwa 1 East Japan Typhoon, was a large and costly tropical cyclone that caused widespread destruction in Japan. The thirty-eighth depression, ninth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, it was the strongest typhoon to strike mainland Japan in decades, and one of the largest typhoons ever recorded, with a peak gale-force diameter of 825 nautical miles. The typhoon raised global media attention, as it greatly affected the 2019 Rugby World Cup being hosted by Japan. Hagibis was also the deadliest typhoon to strike Japan since Typhoon Fran in 1976."", '“Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.”', 'RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15\xa0April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US.

The International Date Line (IDL) is also an imaginary line that runs from the North to the South Pole and separates two calendar days. The IDL is important in measuring time and is crucial for instantaneous communication, politics, and commerce. The IDL is an imaginary line that roughly follows the 180° line of longitude and passes through the Pacific Ocean. However, this line is not straight and strays from the 180° meridian at certain points. In some places, it appears as zig-zag, deviating to the meridian’s east or west. The deviations enable places of the same economic and political affiliations to share the same date or time. Otherwise, if the IDL were a straight line, it would divide certain landmasses into two parts with two different dates on the same day. From the North Pole, the IDL first bends to the east to pass near the Chukchi Peninsula (Russia) and Wrangel Island’s east, then proceeds through the Bering Strait before bending towards the west of St. Matthew and St. Lawrence Islands. From there, the line runs between the Commander Islands and the Aleutian Islands and returns to the 180° meridian until it passes the equator. Below the equator, the line swings far to the east, near the 150° meridian, and circumscribes Kiribati. It then returns westward but remains to the 180° longitude’s east, passing through American Samoa and Samoa. Finally, the line bends southwestwards and follows the 180° meridian until it reaches Antarctica. The IDL was established in 1884 by the International Meridian Conference as an imaginary line roughly following the 180° meridian and not any other meridian (including the Prime Meridian). The conference, attended by 26 nations, settled on 180° longitude because it runs through an open ocean (Pacific Ocean) and zig-zagged it to keep the surrounding nations, especially island countries, within the same day and date. People traveling westward from the IDL gain one hour every 15° of longitude crossed, while those traveling eastward lose one hour. Therefore, people traveling westwards without adjusting their time back by an hour for every 15° meridian will discover that they have gained an extra day when they return home. This happened to Ferdinand Magellan’s crew after their 1522 expedition. However, one loses 24 hours or one day if they travel eastwards around the globe. For two hours a day, between 10:00 and 11:59 UTC, there are three separate calendar dates. For example, at 10:30 UTC on Friday, it is 11:30 PM Thursday in American Samoa, 12:30 AM UTC Saturday in Kiritimati and 6:30 AM UTC Friday in New York. Baker Island and Howland Island have the Earth’s latest time at UTC-12, while Kiritimati (Kiribati) is among the first places to see a new day at UTC+14.

what's the difference between a safety valve and relief valve,"['Quality products and efficient organisation, combined with a competitive price and a first class relationship with major international manufacturers, help us to satisfy the most demanding requirements of the valve market. A valve is a device that regulates the flow of fluids (either gases, fluidised solids, slurries or liquids) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. A ball valve (like the butterfly valve, one of a family of valves called quarter turn valves) is a valve that opens by turning a handle attached to a ball inside the valve. The ball has a hole, or port, through the middle so that when the port is in line with both ends of the valve, flow will occur. When the valve is closed, the hole is perpendicular to the ends of the valve, and flow is blocked. The handle position lets you ""see"" the valve\'s position. There are three general types of ball valves: full port, standard port, and reduced port. A gate valve is a valve that opens by lifting a round or rectangular gate out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar. The gate faces can form a wedge shape or they can be parallel. All gate valves have a rising or a nonrising stem. Rising stems provide a visual indication of valve position. Nonrising stems are used where vertical space is limited or underground. Bonnets provide leakproof closure for the valve body. Gate valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection and cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. Bolted bonnet is used for larger valves and higher pressure applications. Globe valves are named for their spherical body shape. The two halves of the valve body are separated by a baffle with a disc in the center. Globe valves operate by screw action of the handwheel. A bonnet provides leakproof closure for the valve body. Globe valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest bonnet, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. Bolted bonnet is used for larger or higher pressure applications. A Butterfly valve is a type of flow control device, used to make a fluid start or stop flowing through a section of pipe. The valve is similar in operation to a ball valve. A flat circular plate is positioned in the center of the pipe. The plate has a rod through it connected to a handle on the outside of the valve. Rotating the handle turns the plate either parallel or perpendicular to the flow of water, shutting off the flow. Check valveA check valve is a mechanical device, a valve, that normally allows fluid or gas to flow through it in only one direction. An important concept in check valves is the cracking pressure which is the minimum upstream pressure at which the valve will operate. Typically the check valve is designed for and can therefore be specified for a specific cracking pressure. Solenoid ValveA solenoid valve is an electromechanical valve (for use with liquid or gas) controlled by running (or stopping) an electrical current through a solenoid, (which is a coil of wire) thus changing the state of the valve. Solenoid valves may have two or more ports: in the case of a two-port valve the flow is switched on or off; in the case of a three-port valve, the outflow is switched between the two outlet ports.Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold. A spring may be used to hold the valve opened or closed while the valve is not activated. Relief ValveThe relief valve is a type of valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system by allowing the pressure source fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage, away from the main flow path. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the pressure setting is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the ""path of least resistance"" as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. In the petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing and power generation industries, the term relief valve is synonymous with the terms pressure relief valve (PRV), pressure safety valve (PSV) and safety valve. In most countries, such industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the ASME, API and other organizations must be complied with and those codes include design standards for relief valves. GFI supply electric, gas, hydraulic powered quarter-turn actuators, pneumatic actuators, hydraulic special purpose valve positioner, actuators, etc. Experienced industry staff provide a “centre of excellence” resource to our clients in both electrical and mechanical fields. info@gfienterprises.co.uk © 2014 GFI Enterprises.

Box 1236Russellville, AL 35653', 'A pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the “path of least resistance” as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid or gas is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted process media is usually routed through a piping system or vented to the atmosphere. Most relief valves used in industrial applications base their relieving capacity on a percentage of overpressure beyond that of the cracking pressure. As seen in our Circle Seal 5100 series flow charts, the relieving capabilities are shown at 10%, 25% and 50% over the valves cracking pressure. These percentages allow the engineer to understand the flow characteristics of the valve at these common intervals. Most applications are designed to have the relief valve relieve overpressure at 10% of the valves cracking pressure, while other applications can allow up to 50% of overpressure to accumulate before it meets the required flow to relieve overpressure. As pressure increases so does the relieving capacity which can either be gradual or instant depending on the seal and set pressure. An example is our Circle Seal 500 series relief valves. When set to a lower cracking pressure such as 25 psi with soft seals, such as Buna N and Viton, they tend to gradually relieve the overpressure in a system. However, our Hoke R6000 series relief valve, which can be set to higher pressures, tend to quickly “pop off” and relieve excess pressure instantly. Standard noncoded relief valves serve their purpose for most of the applications out there. When the application involves boilers or pressure vessels, the most important single safety device is the pressure relief valve (PRV). The pressure relief valve is all that stands between overpressure conditions and catastrophic explosions. In most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also, in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) published section VIII Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code establishes safety regulations for boilers and pressure vessels. The VIII section gives detailed requirements for the design, fabrication, testing, and certification for both fired and unfired pressure vessels. It specifically refers to those pressure vessels that operate at pressures, either internal or external, that exceed 15 psig. Valves marked with the ASME stamp MUST achieve a large constant flow rate at no more than 10% overpressure to be ASME rated which ensures the protection of the pressure vessel and downstream equipment. Safety is the number one priority! There is no substitute for an ASME coded valve in an ASME application. Though many of these valves look like their non-coded counterparts, inspectors can easily spot a non-coded valve and can immediately shut down the system until the correct valve is installed. Circle Valve Technologies offers three series of safety relief valves that meet this ASME code, the M5100 series ASME, D500 Series ASME and the Rockwood Swendeman relief valve. These valves are unique, in that they must meet a specific flow requirement at a specific set pressure. Each valve is not only stamped with the ASME logo for visual inspection but also indicate their SCFM flow rate. Commonly found on Industrial and Cryogenic pressure vessels, the Rockwood Swendeman ASME RXSO series relieves quickly all while protecting the pressure vessel and downstream equipment. These are offered in bronze body material as found in the RXSO 710 series or stainless found in the RXSO-S 760 series and can be set from 15 psig to 400 psig. Our Circle Seal line also offers ASME rated valves in the M5100 ASME series and D500 ASME series with an adjustable range of 50-1200 psig for the M5100 series and 15-150 psig for the D500 series. Both series are available in your choice of naval brass or 316 stainless steel body materials and a manual override. Circle Valve Technologies can help you with your specific application and guide you to the best relief valve choice.

Unfortunately, the ultimate bursting of this unprecedented asset bubble is going to throw the U.S. and global economy into another depression. One of the most fervent believers in the “low inflation” myth is President Donald Trump himself. Trump has complained many times about the Fed’s interest rate hikes that have occurred during his presidency. Over the past three years, the Fed hiked rates from 0% to 2.5%, which is still extremely low considering that rates above 5% were common throughout history. As\xa0Trump said\xa0earlier this month – “Well I personally think the Fed should drop rates,” Mr. Trump said. “I think they really slowed us down.\xa0There’s no inflation.\xa0I would say in terms of quantitative tightening, it should actually now be quantitative easing. Very little if any inflation. And I think they should drop rates, and they should get rid of quantitative tightening. You would see a rocket ship. Despite that, we’re doing very well.” “Memo to Powell: keep listening. Be patient. Enjoy the employment gains. Let’s keep the strength going by waiting a little and not being too judgmental about rate hikes like some of your colleagues,” Cramer said. The\xa0“Mad Money\xa0” host reiterated his distaste in some Fed officials’ tendency to stick to traditional metrics when gauging how the economy is doing. “How can you claim to be data-dependent if you’ve made up your mind before you see the data that you need one or two more rate hikes to get back to normal?” he asked. “Normal is where the data says you should go. Normal is the natural progression of jobs being created\xa0without a lot of inflation.\xa0Normal is not a percent.” Belief in the “low inflation” myth stems from the overly rigid reliance on conventional inflation indicators even though we have been in an\xa0unconventional economic cycle since 2009 (because it has been driven by record low interest rates and trillions of dollars worth of quantitative easing). In this type of environment, it is wise to think outside of the box and to consider all information available, but most economists are still stuck in the past as if we are in a garden-variety business cycle in the twentieth century. The Federal Reserve’s\xa0preferred\xa0inflation indicator is the core personal consumption expenditure price index (excluding volatile food and energy), which tracks the prices of U.S. consumer goods and services. The Fed has an official target of 2% annual inflation, but inflation has been running cooler than that since the Great Recession according to the core PCE index. The inflation index most commonly referenced in the financial media is the core Consumer Price Index or CPI (excluding volatile food and energy). The core PCI tells a similar message as the core PCE index: consumer price inflation has been tepid since the Great Recession. Overly rigid reliance on conventional inflation indicators has made the mainstream economics community completely blind to the elephant in the room, which is the fact that inflation has been concentrated in asset prices rather than consumer prices. As the chart below shows (which I’ve recreated from\xa0a chart\xa0made by Goldman Sachs a couple years ago), assets such as global stocks and bonds have risen at a much higher rate than global real economy prices since the current bull market began in March 2009. Consumer price inflation has remained low while asset price inflation has exploded because\xa0asset prices have been acting like a relief valve for inflationary pressures\xa0that have been created by record low global interest rates and the pumping of trillions of dollars worth of liquidity into the global financial system. This doesn’t mean that we don’t have an inflation problem; we have a\xa0tremendous\xa0inflation problem on our hands, but you need to know where to look. A\xa0relief valve\xa0or\xa0pressure relief valve\xa0(PRV) is a type of\xa0safety valve\xa0used to control or limit the\xa0pressure\xa0in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect\xa0pressure vessels\xa0and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the “path of least resistance” as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid–gas mixture) is usually routed through a\xa0piping\xa0system known as a\xa0flare header\xa0or\xa0relief header\xa0to a central, elevated\xa0gas flare\xa0where it is usually burned and the resulting\xa0combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve’s reseating pressure, the valve will close. As discussed earlier, the U.S. is currently experiencing a massive asset bubble due to the Fed’s aggressive, unconventional monetary policies during and after the Great Recession. The first of these policies is known as zero interest rate policy or ZIRP. The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate (the Fed Funds rate) to virtually zero and held rates at record low levels for a record length of time. Asset and credit bubbles often form when central banks cut interest rates to artificially low levels because it becomes much cheaper to borrow, low rates discourage saving and encourage speculation in riskier assets & endeavors, and because they encourage higher rates of inflation, to name a few examples. The dot-com and U.S. housing bubbles formed during relatively low interest rate periods as well. In addition to ZIRP, the Fed utilized an unconventional monetary policy known as quantitative easing or QE, which pumped $3.5 trillion dollars worth of liquidity into the U.S. financial system from 2008 to 2014. When conducting QE, the Fed creates new money digitally for the purpose of buying bonds and other assets, which helps to boost the financial markets. The chart below shows the growth of the Fed’s balance sheet since QE started in 2008: The chart below compares the Fed’s balance sheet to the S&P 500. Notice how each expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet led to a corresponding increase in the S&P 500. The Fed’s aggressive inflation of stocks and other assets has created a dangerous bubble in U.S. household wealth (see\xa0my presentation\xa0about this). U.S. household net worth has hit record levels relative to the GDP in recent years, which is a sign that household wealth is overly inflated and heading for an inevitable crash. The last two times household wealth became so stretched relative to the GDP were during the dot-com bubble and housing bubble, both of which ended in disaster. Terrifyingly, the current household wealth bubble blows the last two out of the water. There is a direct link between how large our current household wealth bubble is and how interest rates have been at record low levels for a record length of time. Unfortunately, the coming household wealth crash will be proportional to the run-up. (The Fed-driven household wealth bubble is also the main driver of growing U.S. wealth inequality, as\xa0I explained\xa0in\xa0Forbes\xa0recently.) In addition to the fact that U.S. consumer price inflation has been low since the Great Recession because inflation has been concentrated in asset prices, there are many reasons to believe that consumer price inflation is actually running a lot hotter than mainstream economists think it is (or want\xa0you\xa0to think it is). According to\xa0John Williams, the proprietor of Shadow Government Statistics, the U.S. CPI formula has been changed over the years for the purpose of understating inflation. Because so many high-tech consumer products have entered our lives over the past forty years and those products have improved at a rapid rate, they have masked the very real inflation that has occurred in big ticket necessities like housing, healthcare, childcare, and higher education. Sure, it’s great that laptops, cell phones, and big screen TVs have been falling in price while gaining more features, but that doesn’t help Americans who are\xa0going bankrupt\xa0due to exorbitant medical bills,\xa0being crushed\xa0under the weight of student loans, and\xa0can’t find\xa0affordable housing anywhere. To summarize, America has a very real inflation problem, but it’s not where everyone is looking. The pervasive, but wrong belief that interest rates should remain at ultra-low levels will only serve to further inflate the asset bubbles that the mainstream economics world is ignoring or in denial of. Unfortunately, these bubbles are eventually going to burst and will cause an economic depression. We should not expect a different outcome when the same characters who completely missed the housing bubble’s obvious warning signs are still employed at the Fed, the big banks, investment firms, academia, and financial media.

what is the definition of the name josephine,"['Josephine is a female given name. It is the English version of the French name Joséphine. This is the feminine form of the name Joseph, which is taken from the Hebrew name Yosef, meaning Jehovah increases. It was originally a diminutive form of the French name Joséphe, and eventually became the standard form in the 19th century, replacing Joséphe, which eventually became a very rare name. Josephine is now the 260th most popular name in the USA. Diminutive forms of this name include Fifi, Jo, Josie, Joetta and Jojo, an Irish version ""Seosaimhín"", the Spanish version ""Josefina"" or Josephina and the Greek version Iosiphina (Greek: Ιωσηφίνα). Also spelled Yosefina and Gosefine. The Swedish version is Josefine. ""Josephine"" was a 1951 song with music by Wayne King and Burke Bivens and lyrics by Gus Kahn. Josephine is a 2001 English-language Croatian film directed by Rajko Grlić. It was shown at several international film festivals in 2001, but was never released to theatres as the production company filed for bankruptcy during the film\'s post-production. The domain name ""name"" is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. It is intended for use by individuals for representation of their personal name, nicknames, screen names, pseudonyms, or other types of identification labels. The top-level domain was founded by Hakon Haugnes and Geir Rasmussen and initially delegated to Global Name Registry in 2001, and become fully operational in January 2002. Verisign was the outsourced operator for .name since the .name launch in 2002 and acquired Global Name Registry in 2008. On the .name TLD, domains may be registered on the second level (john.name) and the third level (john.doe.name). It is also possible to register an e-mail address of the form john@doe.name. Such an e-mail address may have to be a forwarding account and require another e-mail address as the recipient address, or may be treated as a conventional email address (such as john@doe.com), depending on the registrar. When a domain is registered on the third level (john.doe.name), the second level (doe.name in this case) is shared, and may not be registered by any individual.  Other second level domains like johndoe.name remain unaffected. A name is a term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called ""common names"" or (obsolete) ""general names"". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or scientist can give an element a name. Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another. A feudal naming habit is used sometimes in other languages: the French sometimes refer to Aristotle as ""le Stagirite"" from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to Shakespeare as ""The Bard"", recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language. Also, claims to preference or authority can be refuted:  the British did not refer to Louis-Napoleon as Napoleon III during his rule. An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the ""object"" or class may be an idea, physical [countable] object (or class thereof), or physical [noncountable] substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those. The words, numbers, letters, or symbols may follow an encoding system (wherein letters, digits, words, or symbols stand for (represent) ideas or longer names) or they may simply be arbitrary. When an identifier follows an encoding system, it is often referred to as a code or ID\xa0code. Identifiers that do not follow any encoding scheme are often said to be arbitrary\xa0IDs; they are arbitrarily assigned and have no greater meaning. (Sometimes identifiers are called ""codes"" even when they are actually arbitrary, whether because the speaker believes that they have deeper meaning or simply because he is speaking casually and imprecisely.)', '', ""Commentary on the submissions in this letter is due on March 24.

The union adopted the Delaware flag on July 24, 1913. The flag’s background color is colonial blue. It encircles a buff-colored diamond, which has a coat of arms on it. Beneath the diamond is written “December 7, 1787”. This is the day on which Delaware became the first state to ratify the country’s constitution. The Delaware state seal, adopted on January 17, 1777, has the coat of arms. Around it, the words “Great Seal of the State of Delaware” is written. The dates 1793, 1847, and 1907 are also mentioned. In the middle of the coat of arms is a horizontal orange shield with blue and white stripes. The stripes symbolize a sheaf of wheat and corn cob. On the white stripe stands an ox. On top of the shield is a sailing ship. To the left of the shield is a farmer and to the right is a rifleman. Below the shield is the state motto.

The Delmarva Peninsula has overlapping regions with Maryland and Virginia. The state’s northernmost region is a section of the Piedmont Plateau. Delaware has two major land sectors: Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Piedmont is an area of smooth, undulating hills in the state’s northwest corner.

The conventional four seasons make their presence felt one after the other. Summers are hot and humid, mainly inland in the Brandywine Valley and other rural regions. Before European colonists came to Delaware, Eastern Algonquian tribes or the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, occupied this land. They lived mainly along the coast and the Nanticoke, who controlled a large part of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. The Dutch were the first to settle in modern Delaware among the Europeans. They soon set up a trading post at Zwaanendael. However, in less than a year, all of the first settlers were killed by Native American tribes. In 1638, New Sweden was established as a trading post in Fort Christina, now known as Wilmington. Peter Minuit, a Swede who headed a group of Swedes, Dutch, and Finns, was instrumental in setting up this post. In 1664, Sir Robert Carr, an Englishman, led a fleet of ships and won over the Dutch. He was working under the instructions of the Duke of York. When the Duke handed over ownership to William Penn in 1682, he wanted access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province. Later, he leased the “Lower Counties” on the Delaware River from Duke. William Penn soon formed a representative government and brought together his two properties under one General Assembly in 1682. But, by 1704, the Province of Pennsylvania had become so big that its representatives wanted to make independent decisions. Eventually, the two groups began meeting separately at Philadelphia and New Castle. Penn and his descendants were proprietors of both. They appointed the same person as Governor for Pennsylvania and Lower Counties. The Lower Counties had no intention to break with Britain initially. Their relationships with the government were good, so they had more independence than the other colonies. The Wilmington merchants had trading links with the British. After the American Revolution, Delaware’s statesmen were one of the leading proponents of a strong central United States. They wanted equal representation for each state. Delaware has only three counties, the fewest among any US state. Sussex County is the largest county, having a total area of 1196.9 sq mi (3,100 sq km).

It is the second smallest and sixth least populated state in the country, and its size makes it a perfect place for any golden ager to settle down and relax, at a bit of a slower pace of life. This doesn't however mean that it's boring there, as it boasts a whole host of different cultural and sporting activities throughout the year. The state is bordered by Maryland on the South and West, by New Jersey to the Northeast and by Pennsylvania to the North. Delaware is sometimes known as the First State, as it was one of the states that fought in the American Revolution, and it was the first state to endorse the Constitution of United States in December 1787. The state consists of three counties: New Castle, Kent and Sussex. While all of the counties started to grow predominantly through agriculture New Castle County is more industrialized than the other two. Kent and Sussex remain largely reliant on agriculture as their main economic source, and together their output is mainly poultry, soybeans, dairy commodities and corn. The great thing about Delaware is that the industrial and agricultural growth have not had a detrimental impact on the scenery in the area. The state is home to three wildlife refuges, namely Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, Killkohook National Wildlife Refuge and Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge. These, along with numerous parks and the ever popular Rehoboth Beach, mean that Delaware is a great place for city and nature lovers alike. The weather in Delaware is also favorable with warm humid summers, and cool, moderate winters, particularly along the coast, perfect for any retirees looking for a more mild climate. What's more, the economy in Delaware is booming, and with an unemployment rate sitting at 8.5% it is below the national average. Cost of living is equal to most other states, and it ranks as the 9th highest per capita income in the United States. Tax rates are friendly, being some of the lowest in the country.

what's the population of the phoenix metropolitan area,"['As of 2020, the Phoenix Metropolitan area consists of Maricopa and Pinal counties, comprising a total area of about 14,600 square miles. Because of the size of counties in Arizona, even though Maricopa and Pinal counties together contain nearly 4.9 million people, most of the area is uninhabited, which gives the MSA an extremely low density compared to other major MSAs in the nation. The average elevation in the city itself is about 1,100 feet (340\xa0m), with the highest point being in South Mountain Park Preserve 2,704 feet (824\xa0m).The highest point in the two county area is 7,657 feet (2,334\xa0m) in the Four Peaks mountain range. Another quirk of a grid system based upon the Public Land Survey System is due to the occasional corrections in the grid caused by the curvature of the earth. This results in arterial roadways deviating slightly from a straight line, as can be seen in many locations where roads abruptly curve either just north or just south of Baseline Road to follow a new section line. This has been a source of confusion for a few newcomers, who might end up, for example, at 91st Avenue and Thunderbird Road, when in fact they intended to go to 91st Street and Thunderbird Road, between 30\xa0minutes and an hour away from one another depending on traffic. Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport began commercial passenger flights in 2004. The airport provides service to over 40 destinations.', '', 'The Phoenix Metropolitan Area – often referred to as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley or Metro Phoenix – is a metropolitan area, centered on the city of Phoenix, that includes much of the central part of the U.S. State of Arizona. The United States Census Bureau designates the area as the Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), defining it as Maricopa and Pinal counties. As of the Census Bureau\'s 2014 population estimates, the Valley had 4,489,109 residents, making it the 12th largest Metropolitan Area in the nation. It is also one of the fastest growing major metropolitan areas, gaining nearly 300,000 residents from 2010 to 2014, and more than 1.2 million since 2000. The population of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area increased by 45.3% from 1990 through 2000, compared to the average United States rate of 13.2%, helping to make Arizona the second fastest growing state in the nation in the 1990s (the fastest was Nevada). The 2000 Census reported the population of the metropolitan area to be 3,251,876. For urban centres outside metropolitan areas, that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region, the concept of the regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or regio was introduced by German professors in 2006. The metropolitan area (Portuguese: área metropolitana) is a type of administrative division in Portugal. Since the 2013 local government reform, there are two metropolitan areas: Lisbon and Porto. The metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto were created in 1991. A law passed in 2003 supported the creation of more metropolitan areas, under the conditions that they consisted of at least nine municipalities (concelhos) and had at least 350,000 inhabitants. Several metropolitan areas were created under this law (Algarve, Aveiro, Coimbra, Minho and Viseu), but a law passed in 2008 abolished these, converting them into intermunicipal communities, whose territories are (roughly) based on the NUTS III statistical regions. The branches of administration of the metropolitan area are the metropolitan council, the metropolitan executive committee and the strategic board for metropolitan development. The metropolitan council is composed of the presidents of the municipal chambers of the municipalities. An aire urbaine (literal and official translation: ""urban area"") is an INSEE (France\'s national statistics bureau) statistical concept describing a core of urban development and the extent of its commuter activity. When applied to larger agglomerations, this unit becomes similar to a U.S. metropolitan area, and the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire métropolitaine to refer to France\'s larger aires urbaines. The aire urbaine is based on France\'s nationwide map of interlocking administrative commune municipalities: when a commune has over 2000 inhabitants and contains a centre of dense construction (buildings spaced no more than 200 metres apart), it is combined with other adjoining communes fulfilling the same criteria to become a single unité urbaine (""urban unit"" ); if an urban unit offers over 10,000 jobs and its economical development is enough to draw more than 40% of the population of a nearby municipalities (and other municipalities drawn to these in the same way) as commuters, it becomes a pôle urbain (""urban cluster"") and the ""commuter municipalities"" become its couronne (""rim""), but this only on the condition that the urban unit itself is not part of another urban cluster\'s rim. The aire urbaine is an urban cluster and its rim combined, or a statistical area describing a central urban core and its economic influence on surrounding municipalities.', ""If you live in the Phoenix metro area, you'll see these terms used regularly in the media, literally hundreds if not thousands of times a year. But the general public doesn't seem to have a clear idea of what constitutes the East Valley and the West Valley. Here's what we've found after taking a close look at a\xa0map of Metro Phoenix cities and towns\xa0and a list of cities and towns in Maricopa County. That definition varies, but we define the East Valley as those cities and towns in Maricopa County that are south and east of Phoenix and Scottsdale. These include: Although not a city or town, we include Sun Lakes in East Valley. Unlike some magazines and newspapers, we do not include Scottsdale in any definition of the East Valley. Yes, it is east of Phoenix. Still, like Phoenix, Scottsdale is an internationally known destination that's large and diverse enough to stand on its own. We include all the cities and towns that are west of Phoenix. Those include: Although they are not cities or towns, we include Sun City, Sun City West, and Sun City Grand in West Valley. The City of Phoenix is well-defined, but there are a few communities that are usually included in discussions of Phoenix. The original Anthem is not a city or a town. It is a large community north of Phoenix that\xa0started as a planned community. Cave Creek is also in the northern part of town, and it is often associated with Phoenix. The two even share some zip codes. Some people prefer to associate Paradise Valley with Scottsdale, probably because both are considered affluent areas. Geographically, Paradise Valley is probably more closely aligned with Phoenix. So, for example, Paradise Valley resorts\xa0should be included when discussing\xa0Phoenix summer resort packages.\u200b Again, the city of Scottsdale is well-defined. Geographically, it runs all along the eastern border of Phoenix and is over 30 miles long. Most people include Carefree with Scottsdale, although Cave Creek and Carefree are sister communities that are both in the northeastern part of the metro area. They associate Fountain Hills with Scottsdale as well. There is no official designation known as\xa0Greater Phoenix. The\xa0Phoenix Metropolitan Area, commonly known as the\xa0Valley of the Sun, the\xa0Salt River Valley, or\xa0Metro Phoenix, is a\xa0metropolitan area\xa0anchored by the city of\xa0Phoenix and surrounded by most of the central portion of the state of Arizona. The\xa0United States Census Bureau\xa0designates the area as the\xa0Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale\xa0Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes Maricopa\xa0and\xa0Pinal\xa0counties. The informal designations Greater Phoenix and Metro Phoenix refer to the places where most people around the Phoenix-centered region live, work, go to school, and play. This means that in everyday usage, these terms usually also comprise Native American lands, Gold Canyon, Superior, Florence, Maricopa, and Casa Grande since they are geographically very close to but not necessarily in Maricopa County.

By Colibri1968 at English Wikipedia (Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons.) [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsGuest essay by Eric Worrall One thing which struck me about the recent climate science hearing is how little attention was paid to Dr. John Christy’s demonstration of a flawed climate model prediction – the missing Tropospheric hotspot. A flawed prediction does not automatically mean the models are totally wrong – but it is a strong indicator that something isn’t right. Consider the primary observation. The world has warmed since the mid 1850s, and for the sake of argument lets assume that the world has warmed since the mid 1930s. 1. Chaotic shifts in ocean currents or solar influences have influenced global temperature. 2. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions have caused global temperature to rise 3. Gnomes are lighting fires under the polar icecaps. All three of the theories proposed above can potentially explain the primary observation – the world is warming, and heating is more pronounced in polar regions. The way you eliminate incorrect theories is to test other non-trivial secondary predictions. It is easy to create a theory which explains global warming – even my Gnome theory does that. What is more difficult is to create a theory which coherently explains other observable phenomena, or better still predicts observations which haven’t been attempted yet. For example, there are simple tests for the presence of Gnomes lighting fires under the polar icecaps. You could dig holes and try to find the Gnomes. If you don’t find any Gnomes, you cannot conclusively prove they don’t exist – the Gnomes might be very good at evading attempts at discovery. But failure to find Gnomes, or failure to find evidence of extensive efforts to light fires under the polar icecaps, should allow you to conclude that the Gnome theory is very unlikely to be correct. How do you test the Anthropogenic CO2 theory? Just as the Gnomes lighting fires theory predicts the existence of Gnomes and extensive fire pits under the polar ice caps, so the Anthropogenic CO2 theory predicts various observations. We could simply wait 50 years and see if global temperatures go crazy, but it would be nice to know whether the theory is correct before we all cook. So we need a non trivial secondary observation which we can test here and now. One of the key predicted observations of anthropogenic CO2 climate theory is the existence of an equatorial tropospheric hotspot. The hotspot prediction is easy to understand. The atmosphere is thicker, reaches higher into space over the equator than the poles, due to centrifugal force of the Earth’s spin. Centrifugal force is greater at the equator than the poles, so air, including CO2, tends to pile up higher into space over the equator. The equator also receives more sunlight. If the buildup of greenhouse gasses is trapping significantly more heat, the effect on the atmosphere should be most pronounced where the sunlight is strongest and the greenhouse blanket is thickest. But nobody has yet managed to unequivocally detect that predicted hotspot. Various theories have been advanced to explain the missing hotspot. For example one theory is the balloon measurements are not being analysed correctly, so the hotspot is there, but it is evading detection unless you properly homogenise the data. In my opinion this theory is undermined by satellite measurements which confirm the un-homogenised balloon measurements. This confirmation of un-homogenised balloon measurements casts doubt on the data homogenisation process which led to the alleged detection of the hotspot. Another theory I have seen mentioned is that the hotspot is there, but the effect is not pronounced enough to be detectable as yet. More plausible in my opinion than the instrument anomaly theory, but this proposition verges intriguingly close to an admission that anthropogenic global warming is not a big deal. Whatever the reason, the absence of a pronounced hotspot is or should be as much of an embarrassment to the Anthropogenic CO2 theory, as the absence of fire pits and captured Gnomes is an embarrassment to the Gnome theory. The answer is no. There are plenty of examples of scientific theories which were slightly wrong, which didn’t fully explain observations, which were later found to be mostly right. Newtonian gravity mostly explains the orbit of the planets, but some observations don’t match the theory. For example, Newtonian predictions of the orbit of Mercury do not match observations. Mercury is very close to the sun, much closer than the Earth. That close to a massive body like the Sun, Einstein’s General Relativity becomes important. Relativistic effects cause Mercury’s orbit to diverge from Newtonian predictions of what its orbit should be. This deviation from theoretical predictions does not mean Newtonian theory is broken, in this case it simply means the Newtonian theory is incomplete. Unless you need extreme precision, for example when creating a global positioning satellite system, the tiny perturbations introduced by Einstein’s theory are not significant enough to worry about. But a flawed prediction is not something which should be ignored. Sometimes when you don’t find any gnomes at the bottom of the garden, you should stop digging holes. As for the theory that chaotic shifts in ocean currents or solar influences control the climate, the evidence for this seems to be a mixed bag. Suggestions that the eleven year solar cycle affects climate are convincingly disputed by Willis. If the powerful eleven year solar cycle doesn’t do anything to the climate, why would longer solar cycles have any effect? On the other hand, there appears to be growing evidence solar modulation of cosmic rays may have a significant effect on atmospheric chemistry. In my opinion, the short answer is we simply don’t know what drives the climate. More research is required, without premature efforts to formulate policy around theories which clearly do not explain all the key observations. You dont take out an insurance policy on anything if the cost of the insurance is greater than the replacement value. At least I wouldnt. http://www.thedemiseofchristchurch.com Or if the uninsured risks are modest. I know a number of people who do not have property insurance but have only contents insurance. The risk of severe property damage being small, but the risk of theft being more substantial. Further, one has to consider whether you are insuring against the most dominant risk. Say act of god is excluded from the cover, and the largest property risk is earthquake damage. Thus, if warming is natural and warming is bad, the insurance does not cover the risk that you have insured against and thus the premium expense is worthless. Yet further, one needs to be sure that the risk against which one is insuring is actually bad. Thus, if a warmer world is a good thing (personally I consider that it would be a net positive), there is no risk worth insuring against. Just adapt, to the extent that adaption may be needed in isolated examples. Finally, is the cure worse than the disease. Is it better to have a drain/headwind on GDP now in the present, rather than to have no such drain, allow wealth to be created and use the accumulated money to be used in 100 years time if warming at that time has brought about real problems that need to be tackled. Overall, I consider the insurance analogy to be a poor analogy, but even if one goes along that line of reasoning, one can immediately see problems with doing anything at all. There are simply too many unknowns, whereas we know that man is good at adaption and we know that man can live in almost any climate state from Siberia to the equatorial regions. The “red team” concept applied to climate models is an example of the use of the precautionary principle, but this principle is honored in the breach when it comes to ensuring that our climates models are free of unwarranted assumptions or biases. To give an example, nobody (well almost nobody) would pay for a ‘Zombie Apocolypse’ rider on your home insurance even tho the insurance companies would love to offer that ‘protection’. Why has most of this thread been hijacked by somebody who wants to talk about insurance? I have to drop down to comment approx no. 88 (half the present count) before I find anyone – in this case Nick Stokes – who tries to talk about the ‘hot spot’ which is the subject Eric introduces – and even he doesn’t seem to have much success bringing the thing back on track for long. ?Can’t we do better than this.. and earthquake, meteor, alien invasion, the sky is falling, sharknado and raining cats and dogs insurance. They’re vicious when cornered. Most of the warming has occurred in Earth’s coldest air masses, at night, during winter.  High temperatures haven’t risen much, if at all.  Most of the warming has been the result of higher low temperatures, resulting in slightly higher average temperatures. This is actually consistent with a slightly enhanced “greenhouse” effect… The warming since 1980 is consistent with our “greenhouse” gas emissions and an extremely low climate sensitivity. All of the observation-based evidence indicates that AGW is nearly insignificant and, at worst, innocuous. “ The warming since 1980 is consistent with our “greenhouse” gas emissions and an extremely low climate sensitivity.” Th above highlighted text is a factually accurate statement, ….. but, IMO, ….. it wrongly infers that said “warming” is the result of said “GHG emissions”. And thus it could be “cited”, “quoted” or considered “conformation” by proponents of CAGW as proof of their anthropogenic beliefs. And iffen “conformation” of their anthropogenic beliefs, they will surely rush out and purchase insurance to CTA when the calamities of CAGW destroy their personal property. Insurance is an invalid analogy to AGW mitigation. A slightly warmer world is better than a slightly colder world. The geological evidence shows us this has always been true. Cold kills, warmth encourages life. Why anybody would want to pay a huge price for a negative outcome is beyond me. Unless you hate civilization and/or people. Show me proof that a warmer world is better.And I don’t mean comparing our world of today to the ice age, because that is not what we are talking about. ” Cold kills, warmth encourages life.” First this completely ignores the key role of precipitation. Second, 40% of the global population live in the tropics (and it will be 50% by 2050), and that does not include already hot regions like the Middle East. Go ahead and conduct a poll of those regions. I doubt very much they would prefer even hotter temperatures. It already routinely reaches the mid 40s in India in the summer months, and the mid to high 40s in the Middle East and parts of Africa. Chris: The temperature of the tropics hasn’t risen much or at all compared to other regions. Well Chris, I certainly wouldn’t invoke the IPCC as the ultimate authority on what’s good for the planet but it sounds like you pray at their altar so I will point out to you that the IPCC states that warming up to 1.8C is beneficial for the planet. Prove them wrong! The fact that people preferentially choose to live in the warmest parts of the planet is hardly a reason to fear warmer temps. Chris, looks to me like all those people living in the tropics have voted and believe they’d rather be warmer than colder. Chris, Ever heard of the  latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG)? It means: the increase in species richness or biodiversity from the poles to the tropics. “The fact that people preferentially choose to live in the warmest parts of the planet is hardly a reason to fear warmer temps.” Huh? They didn’t migrate there, they were born there. So your comment does not make sense. And the vast majority of folks in those countries are not able to emigrate. “Chris, Ever heard of the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG)? It means: the increase in species richness or biodiversity from the poles to the tropics.” So what? I am not arguing that the tropics should have the same climate as the poles. I am saying that folks in the tropics do not want higher temperatures, and higher temperatures will no improve diversity or species richness. How much biodiversity and species richness is there in the Middle East, with it’s warm temperatures? I don’t think you can speak for people living in the tropics. In winter, some members of my family move South in winter to get a climate that is about 20 degrees C warmer. In summer, there is basically no difference. It seems from your writings above that you feel a ‘warmer world’ means all temperatures in the daytime go up, as do all temps at night, meaning everything will be at a higher temperature all the time. I believe there is no evidence to support this concept and a lot of evidence it is incorrect. A warming work has so far meant warmers poles (well, one of them) higher temperatures at night and higher temperatures in winter.  In short, the climate has moderated with warming with smaller day-night excursions. The tropics do not warm when the world does for the simple reason that the upper limit of the ocean temperature is about 31 C. Above that it rapidly covers itself with a cloak of cloud. This fact is not easily evaded. Where the temperature of Central Congo ought to be much higher than it is, given the temperatures to the north and south of it, it is not. Instead, it simply rains more. The idea that increased temperatures in the tropics lead to a decrease in rain and an increase in daytime temperatures is incorrect. Observations show that rainfall increases because of an increase in the cycling speed of water. Long ago when the Earth was much warmer on average, the tropics were the same temperature as now, and the Arctic Ocean was 21 degrees C. That is evidence, very strong evidence, that warming happens mostly at the poles, that the tropics are governed by the ocean-atmosphere water cycle, and that baseless alarmist claims that everything will roast in a dry desert are bunk. The only evidence we have regarding large desert regions from times when we know the earth was warmer (in this inter-glacial) show that desert conditions are moderated, rainfall increases, desert plants thrive, grazing areas expand, rivers flow and ‘nature’ prospers. We also know the opposite holds for times when it was colder. There is literally nothing to worry about that anyone can find. I feel the speculation that an increased average global temperature will create additional discomfort for people living in the tropics has no basis in observation, experience, fact or history. It happens that the temperature of the tropics has dropped slightly since the 1940’s but I do not find that meaningful as it is slight. It does, however, strongly contradict any claim that when the global temperature rises, the tropical temperatures rise. This can be used creatively to argue that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was not a ‘global phenomenon’. It wasn’t on the strictest terms, because the tropics don’t warm when the poles do. The tropical peoples didn’t even notice. It was definitely an actual phenomenon in that both hemispheres warmed, but both the northern and southern tropics did not. This does not unmake the MWP, it just adds to the evidence that CAGW defined as global dehydration and storm chaos is no more than a fairy tale. Gnome tale, if you wish. Excellent. Chris is asking “Show me proof that a warmer world is better.And I don’t mean comparing our world of today to the ice age, because that is not what we are talking about. ” Depends on what you mean with ice age, but the climate optimum is arbitrary and I object to it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_of_1866%E2%80%9368 Apply a 7% discount rate to the “social cost of carbon” and a warmer world is better. Chris, where I live in Queensland on the edge of the Australian tropics the average annual temperature is around 80F. A lot of people retire here. Not the warmest part of the world, but still pretty warm. In response to Chris @ 9:04, the history of the Little Ice Age in Europe (1300-1850) shows us that we should be praying for warmth, not cold. During the preceding Medieval Warm Period population grew and farming expanded and the great cathedrals were built. In a relatively short time beginning around 1300 the temperature dropped and glaciers advanced in Europe and in New Zealand; winters were bitterly cold (recall when the Thames froze over) and springs were cold and wet. Crops failed, farmland had to be abandoned because the extreme wet made it unsuitable, and people starved. Glaciers advanced and wiped out villages. Weather events were “unprecedented”: severe storms were unlike anything seen in previous centuries and it would rain for weeks on end. So great was the misery brought about by the cold and weather extremes that people began to accuse witches of “weather making” and thousands were burned at the stake in an attempt to rid the earth of the fiendish climate. David Middleton — it is also ” consistent with” a considerably more persistent UHI effect. While any increase is lost in the noise during daylight hours the situation after dark is different. We now have heat-generating activities continuing throughout the night to a much greater extent than even 30 years ago, never mind 100 years ago, not to mention these activities taking place over a much wider area. I wouldn’t dare suggest that anyone is fiddling the figures (I mean, would they?!) but how reliabke are the adjustments? Is there any basis for the belief that some rural stations have been improperly adjusted upwards to “bring them in line” with others that have become less rural rather than the more logical (to my mind) practice of trying to create an algorithm to offset fhe artificial increase seen as urbanisation starts to affect previously rural results? “Show me proof that a warmer world is better.” You need to read the complete commentary …. but here are a few excerpts from said, to wit: Western Europe experienced a general cooling of the climate between the years 1150 and 1460 and a very cold climate between 1560 and 1850 that brought dire consequences to its peoples. The colder weather impacted agriculture, health, economics, social strife, emigration, and even art and literature. Increased glaciation and storms also had a devastating affect on those that lived near glaciers and the sea. 1595: Gietroz (Switzerland) glacier advances, dammed Dranse River, and caused flooding of Bagne with 70 deaths. 1600-10: Advances by Chamonix (France) glaciers cause massive floods which destroyed three villages and severely damaged a fourth. One village had stood since the 1200’s. 1670-80’s: Maximum historical advances by glaciers in eastern Alps. Noticeable decline of human population by this time in areas close to glaciers, whereas population elsewhere in Europe had risen. 1695-1709: Iceland glaciers advance dramatically, destroying farms. 1710-1735: A glacier in Norway was advancing at a rate of 100 m per year for 25 years. 1748-50: Norwegian glaciers achieved their historical maximum LIA positions.” Read more @  http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/lia/little_ice_age.html Eric Worrall said: “Chris, where I live in Queensland on the edge of the Australian tropics the average annual temperature is around 80F. A lot of people retire here. Not the warmest part of the world, but still pretty warm.” Eric, 26-27C is very pleasant. That is not what I am referring to. India regularly is in the low 40s during the summer months – that’s 108F, which I doubt many would find comfortable. Thailand gets into the high 30s, And you said retirement. Try working in 40C weather – it’s a whole lot less pleasant than playing golf or doing other retirement activities. Productivity in warm climate regions has already declined due to rising temperatures, and will decline further during coming decades: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/19/as-the-world-grows-hotter-some-workers-are-becoming-less-productive/?utm_term=.b8cee1fb32b2 Show me proof that a warmer world is better. Well the earth has been observed to be greening. I think that’s proof enough that the earth is doing better when warmer with more CO2. The article focuses on the extreme….”That paper showed a fairly dramatic negative influence of heat on economic productivity. In particular, the authors found that  for a single very hot day — warmer than 86 degrees Farenheit — per capita income goes down by $20.56, or 28 percent.” But the paper says “We find that this single environmental parameter continues to play a large role in overall economic performance: productivity of individual days declines roughly 1.7% for each 1°C (1.8°F) increase in daily average temperature above 15°C (59°F).” Apparently 15C is too hot to work. I’m highly sceptical. “According to the Financial Forecast Center, America’s GDP in March should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $646.27 billion per day. The 17 states that are hardest hit by this storm contain approximately 38% of the U.S. population; assuming that 20% of workers won’t show up for work today (based on the British average), we’d hit a figure of $48.8 billion in lost productivity.” http://business.time.com/2010/02/10/the-economic-cost-of-snow/ The LIA has been documented very well and proves without a doubt that colder periods bring famine, hunger, war and societal collapse. The ICE cores show periods of warmer than now such as the Medieval Warm period, The Roman Warm Period that have well documented historical accounts of civilizations peaking during these warm periods. History is your proof, do a little research. Tim said: “The article focuses on the extreme….”That paper showed a fairly dramatic negative influence of heat on economic productivity. In particular, the authors found that for a single very hot day — warmer than 86 degrees Farenheit — per capita income goes down by $20.56, or 28 percent.” Tim, daily highs in SE Asia are 31-33 – every single day, with some days warmer, and only a few colder – unless you go farther north. So that’s 88 to 91F every single day. If you can point to research that refutes these productivity impact claims, please provide them. “..Huh? They didn’t migrate there, they were born there…” Freaking duh. ““The fact that people preferentially choose to live in the warmest parts of the planet is hardly a reason to fear warmer temps.” Huh? They didn’t migrate there, they were born there.” http://www.co2science.org/articles/V9/N23/C2.php Periods of glacial advance correlate with solar minima during the LIA. But you’re right that the Temperate and Polar Zones warmed more during the MWP than did the tropics.  And cooled more during the LIA. In the moist tropics, when it gets that warm, it typically rains. The tropics simply haven’t experienced the increase in temperature that you imagine an fourth CO2 molecule per 10,000 dry air molecules has supposedly brought. Al Gore made the same mistake, alleging that  “man-made global warming” had cause the ice on Kilimanjaro to melt, when in fact the cause of glacial shrinkage was less precipitation due to cutting down forests on the mountain’s slopes.  There has been no change in the average temperature of the surrounding area of East Africa. Hey Mark, can you let the National Climate Change Secretariat in Singapore know that their temperature measurements and projections are all wrong? You know, Singapore which is on the equator and has humidity that ranges from 70-90%. https://www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/national-circumstances/impact-climate-change-singapore Talk about clueless….. Tim the tool man, you quoted productivity losses on snow days where businesses are closed or workers can’t get there. That’s going to be 1-4 weeks per year in places like Buffalo or Chicago. In the tropics, at least in the equatorial regions, it’s 31C or hotter more than 300 days per year. Big difference. It already routinely reaches the mid 40s in India in the summer months, and the mid to high 40s in the Middle East and parts of Africa.” No mention of SE Asia in this post I was replying to. But, you do mention Africa. My post in reply stands, you haven’t a clue about the poor in Africa. PatrickMJD said: “No mention of SE Asia in this post I was replying to. But, you do mention Africa. My post in reply stands, you haven’t a clue about the poor in Africa.” You clearly haven’t a clue that AGW is contributing to the famine problems in Africa, in addition to conflict issues. http://www.voanews.com/a/experts-say-climate-change-may-be-making-african-drought-worse/3783181.html In the tropics, at least in the equatorial regions, it’s 31C or hotter more than 300 days per year. Seriously Chris? Look at the weather in the tropics on a daily basis. Its always 31/32C and varies only a little even at night. For you to claim the paper is suggesting a massive productivity drop for the tropics because its hot there displays a profound misunderstanding of what the paper is claiming. When someone claims productivity drops beyond 15C with each degC then they’re looking at correlation, not causation. I’d love to read their paywalled paper… Tim said: “Look at the weather in the tropics on a daily basis. Its always 31/32C and varies only a little even at night.

When someone claims productivity drops beyond 15C with each degC then they’re looking at correlation, not causation. I’d love to read their paywalled paper…” There are 2 aspects to discussions of temperature and productivity as it relates to the tropics. The first is whether warm temperatures (say of 30 or warmer) result in lower productivity compared to a lower temperature. The paper says this is true. From the article: “Kjellstrom and fellow researchers found that in dozens of countries, daylight work hours lost to excessive heat have increased since the 1990s. They also estimate that at the current rate of global warming, that trend will continue.” So how exactly did I misstate the paper’s findings? The second is whether the impact of rising tropical temperatures on productivity can be quantified given the increase that has occurred in the last 20-30 years, compared to the temperatures back then. The paper also concluded the answer was yes. Why do you think office temps are set to 18-21C instead of 30? Just to spend more of the company’s money? Why does no one try to set marathon records in Phoenix in June, but rather only attempts it in Berlin or Boston in the early spring? Why did siestas evolve in warm weather countries and not in cold? There are a number of papers on this topic (both office and mfg environments), the one I mentioned is one of many. Because the people in the tropics are acclimatised to it. How could they possibly compare a region’s productivity with that same region’s expected productivity when the temperature was lower. The region has never had appreciably lower temperatures and never will. Its productivity is what it is. Unfortunately I dont have access to the paper but I’ll bet this paper is about productivity when say the regional average is 15C and the day being considered is 30C. The difference is that people “feel the heat” but in the tropics they dont (in the same way) What I’d love to see is whether they attributed lower productivity to anything or whether its just possible that people take time off on nice days to go to the beach/pool/wherever. Compare that to snow and its a different story…if you simply cant get to work. Because its a comfortable temperature. The paper referenced suggests productivity drops for every degree above 15C so why do you think office temps aren’t 15C? “Eric, 26-27C is very pleasant. That is not what I am referring to. India regularly is in the low 40s during the summer months – that’s 108F, which I doubt many would find comfortable. Thailand gets into the high 30s, And you said retirement. Try working in 40C weather – it’s a whole lot less pleasant than playing golf or doing other retirement activities.” Chris is absolutely correct and he/she speaks for the 4,574,351 residents of the Valley of the Sun …. where it is sooooooooooo HOT ….. that they lack the energy or ambition to do much of anything …. and thus the reason they are relegated to being the 15th largest gross domestic product producers amongst metro areas in the United States Phoenix’s coldest days of the year usually occur in mid December when the daily maximum temperature averages 67 degrees Fahrenheit (19 degrees Celsius) and the minimum averages 44 °F (7 °C). The year’s hottest days are normally in early July. The average temperature peaks then with daily highs of 107 °F (41 °C). The hottest nights occur late in July with an average low of 83 °F (28 °C). Phoenix averages 107 days a year when the thermometer reaches into the 100s °F (over 38 °C). ” The Phoenix Metropolitan Area – often referred to as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley or Metro Phoenix – is a metropolitan area, centered on the city of Phoenix, that includes much of the central part of the U.S. State of Arizona. As of the Census Bureau’s 2015 population estimates, the Valley had 4,574,351 residents, making it the 12th largest Metropolitan Area in the nation by population. The gross domestic product of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was $215 billion in 2014, 15th largest amongst metro areas in the United States.”   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_metropolitan_area YUP, that Chris is one smart feller and iffen ya don’t believe me …… just ask him. Samuel C Cogar – you posted about Phoenix as a refutation of my comments about heat and productivity. Phoenix is highly air conditioned – golly gee whiz, maybe that makes a difference! I am referring to regions where the vast majority of workers do not have the benefit of AC – garment factories, warehouses, manufacturing plants, etc. While office buildings and malls in tropical regions are air conditioned, most manufacturing plants and warehouses are not.While Phoenix has a decent mfg sector, it’s mostly in electronics, which is air conditioned – Raytheon, Intel, Honeywell, etc. As far as your question about 15C and why offices are not set to that temperature. Office work is sedentary work, so naturally one would need a less cool environment than in a factory for optimum performance. CO2 has less effect when there is lots of water in the air – of course, as the water vapor already reduces emissive cooling. But there is still enough effect to increase temperatures – not only due to reduced cooling through the atmosphere, but also rising sea temperatures, thereby reducing the cooling that comes from ocean breezes. https://www.nccs.gov.sg/news/results-second-national-climate-change-study-consistent-intergovernmental-panel-climate-changes But hey, what does the SG government know? Mark says it’s not true (without providing any supporting links), so it must be the case. Hilarious. “Chris, Chris, Chris. In general, when you are in a hole, quit digging.” Sorry to say so, but that is the normal case when attempting to conduct an intelligent conversation with an under-35 young adolescent who is the product of severely inadequate parental nurturing and/or a blatant miseducation by the Public School System. In Chris’s case, ….. his/her miseducation must have resulted in an “unquestionable” belief that air-conditioning (A/C) and central heating has been in common usage among and/or throughout the populace of the United States ever since the early 1900’s …. or maybe he/she believes A/C has been in use since the start of the Industrial Revolution. It is hard to say given the silliness they have been “taught” to believe is factual truths. Such silliness is “believable” simply because they have never known or remembered a “day-in-their-life” when there was never any installed and functioning A/C in homes, offices, businesses, hospitals, schools and government buildings. Little do those miseducated “clueless” adolescent-minded individuals realize, that the literal fact is, that central heating and A/C was actually scarce and never commonplace up thru the 1960’s and only began being widely installed in new construction in the 1970’s ….. and retrofitted or installed in older buildings up thru the 1980’s. Samuel C Cogar – I’ll assume from your vague post that you are implying that because Phoenix existed before the widespread use of AC, that somehow disproves my point that hot weather affects productivity.First, the existence of a population in a hot climate says nothing about whether that population is productive compared to cooler climates. Phoenix had a population of 450,000 in the mid 60s, before AC became widely used. Today the metropolitan area has 4.3M, a roughly 10X increase during the time when AC use became widespread. So clearly AC was a major enabling and necessary factor in the city’s growth. Nice try, but you’ve done nothing to prove your point. Buy insurance? Not if it was going to cost me what Global Warming speculation is clearly going to cost. If the cost was not a burden on my lifestyle and comfort, I’d keep my insurance. It isn’t a fantasy theory that my house could catch fire or a tornado is possible. So Chris, can I sell you some bolide earth collision insurance? This is something that has happened and will happen again and it is far more to be concerned about than a degree of warming. Climate tipping into a horror show has never happened. The chain of life of 2 billion years has never been broken so even when hit by bolides, which wreaked more disaster on the planet than any other danger, the earth just returned to its long term stable life supporting self and even cooled down to ice ages. Here is what is needed to consider climate ‘insurance’. And this should be the easiest thing to provide for people so sure of themselves. EVIDENCE that anthropogenic global warming is a threat in a century to come. I am an engineer and a scientist so I am convincable If you have some evidence, let’s see it, someone must have evidence. What evidence are you relying on. The consensus? CO2 has used up most of its radiation trapping ability (remember we had 4000 to 7000ppm during long stretches of earth history, but after about 1000ppm, there would be no more noticeable warming. The theory projects 3 times the warming than observations are telling us. The only evidence tells us it has all been overhyped by a couple of hundred percent. We will not reach anywhere near the dangerous 2C in two centuries. Economic fossil fuels will be gone before one century and we will have to switch to nuclear (not renewables). If it’s something that requires me to buy some air conditioners to ameliorate it, well so be it.  If the world is going to end, I would spend my cash on more sporting things than insurance. Chris, you don’t have a scientific background and you have the right make up for being sold on this stuff. “So Chris, can I sell you some bolide earth collision insurance? This is something that has happened and will happen again and it is far more to be concerned about than a degree of warming.” We are not talking a degree of warming, we are already past that. We are talking 2-4C warming. Gary, what is your scientific background? We are not talking a degree of warming, we are already past that. We are talking 2-4C warming.” We are not talking a degree of warming, we are already past that. We are talking 2-4C warming. But all the money the developed nations spend on mitigation will NOT mitigate global CO2 levels, which will continue growing steeply for decades due to continued growth in emissions from developing nations. “We are not talking a degree of warming, we are already past that. We are talking 2-4C warming. Gary, what is your scientific background?” Gary Pearce’s post is pretty much spot on.  But this reply is interesting for two reasons.  First, the claim that the planet has warmed more than one degree.  Since when, and how measured?  That would be the question  Its warmed a lot less than one degree, if its warmed at all, since the Medieval Warm Period, or since the 1930’s even, for that matter. The second thing that is interesting is the ad-hominem argument.  You always hear from the committed that only the ‘experts’ are qualified to have opinions on this.   So Chris tries to turn the argument to Gary’s scientific qualifications. At one level this is just a traditional ad-hominen argument and is fallacious.  Gary’s argument is correct or not regardless of his qualifications.  But at another level something more interesting is going on.  We need to recall in the matter of climate the traditional approach of the far left to the desires of the masses. You might think that the way to find out what the masses want is to ask them.  You would be wrong.  The way to find out is precisely not to ask them, since they are overwhelmed by false consciousness.  Nor is it to ask their elected representatives who are similarly biased.  The way to find out is to ask the Party.  Because the Party is the true representative of the masses and History is on its side. In the same way, we have to ask the experts about climate.  But not any experts, and not experts who have published in the wrong places.  We have to ask the real experts.  And these will surprisingly turn out to be those experts who agree with us. This is what is really going on with the endless rants about the peer reviewed literature and the demand to only consider the views of qualified climate scientists.  Its basically the same thing, what the Party says is right, so shut up. Chris, most of that 1 degree of warming occurred long before CO2 levels started rising. michel, instead of asking what they want, the trick is to observe what they do. Can’t speak for Eric, but for me, it depends on the terms and the likelihood of events occuring. Fire insurance for $100? Sure. Flood insurance for $1000? Depends on if I live in a flood plain. Dinosaur insurance $100,000? Probably not. We are not talking a degree of warming, we are already past that. We are talking 2-4C warming. Gary, what is your scientific background? We’re talking about 1.5 C of warming (transient climate response) at 560 ppm CO2, half of which has already occurred with no demonstrable ill effect. The social cost of carbon, which is based on the mythical 2-4 C scenario you describe, has a negative net present value with any real world discount rate applied. All of the observation-based evidence indicate that AGW is relatively insignificant and that the cost of “insurance” against catastrophic scenarios has a negatve net present value. Dave Middleton says, “All of the observation-based evidence indicate that AGW is relatively insignificant and that the cost of “insurance” against catastrophic scenarios has a negatve net present value.” Dave, my perspective is the evidence is that the benefits are HIGHLY significant.  At 560 PPM we are talking about a 35 to 40 percent increae in crop production ( above and beyond all other reasons for increases in crop yields) all acomplished with little to ZERO increase in land or water required. We also note an increase in available crop land mass at moderate T and greater crop resistance to drought and heat. Obsrvations indicate that the benefits continue to increase, while the harms are MIA. The home insurance policy analogy is silly, Chris; No one is going to “make it right” if the earth goes into overheat mode . . You might be able to cook up some sort of fire prevention/suppression system analogy that sorta makes sense, but the home owner’s insurance one is . . false advertising, if used by proponents of forking over  trillions to “fight” global warming. (And even if the the CAGW hypothesis  is valid, those trillions might make virtually no difference anyway . . ) It’s a perfectly valid analogy, John. It can be worded differently and changed from insurance to spending money as a preventive measure. The core of what I am saying is very simple. Skeptics want to wait until there is 100% certainty before taking action on CAGW, even though in many other areas individuals/families/businesses would never wait until that point before taking action. “You’re telling the poor people of the world to pay insurance on homes they will never have due to their crippling insurance premiums.” Speaking of idiotic, no, that is not what I am saying. In fact, it is folks in the poorer regions who are asking for assistance from wealthier countries whose CO2 emissions are going to impact the climate in their countries. Its exactly not insurance.  Insurance takes an identified risk, like fire, with a known probablity, and then it pays out when the risk comes up in a given case.  It may give a discount for measures known to reduce the risk.  See for instance how insurance companies will lower premiums if proper security systems are installed.  Typically what they suggest are fairly modest expenses in known protective measures. What the climatists want to do is not that at all.  Its to invest very large amounts up front in measures to prevent an uncertain and improbable catastrophe.  This runs up against a quite different set of problems. The main conceptual one is the one that Pascal had, but never addressed.  That is, there are many of these catastrophes and we have to choose which one we insure against because its so expensive. Pascal argued that to disbelieve in the Catholic religion of his day was foolish.  The cost of being wrong was eternal damnation, and this was too high, no matter how unlikely it was, for this to be justifiable to risk, given the fairly modest investment represented by belief. Unfortunately he did not go on to consider how one would take precautions against the consequences of disbelief in Zorastrianism or Islam, which would be equally dire.  But alas, one could not believe in all of them. The question with climate is whether we should invest the astronomical sums required, and accept the human welfare disaster, that the elimination of fossil fuels would cost, in order to avoid the very uncertain and improbable bad things that warming might bring. One can only say, stop talking about insurance and do a business case.  Show how much what you want to do will cost, show what other uses there are for the money and what they would yield.  Then show what effects your investment would have on mitigating the supposed problem. At the moment, we have the Paris Agreement, with no business case.  What it calls for is China and India and the developing world to carry on emitting like there was no tomorrow, and for the US and Europe to make substantial reductions.  The net effect of this will be very small reductions, if any, in tons emitted, and little or no effect on warming.  Even assuming the alarmists are right about the consequences of emissions. Faced with this argument, the climatists then usually try to minimise costs.  They claim that investment in renewables will actually be very profitable.  Fine, show us the business case, fully costed please. They also try to move the argument onto a different plane, either reasoning from historic, per capita, or the use of the Chinese emissions to export.  Or they talk about totally irrelevant Chinese investment in wind and solar. In the end, this is one of two equally absurd arguments.  One is that its fine for China and India to go from about 12 billion tons now to over 20 billion in 2030 because its fair.  Its fair, that is, for them to destroy, or risk destroying, civilisation on earth. Or, they argue that, contrary to what they had previously argued about the catastrophic effects of the US failing to meet its 1.5 billion ton reduction under Paris, the Chinese and Indian increases of 10 billion or so will not actually do much damage. Its totally incoherent.  No wonder they rely on Pascal’s wager! Proof possitive Chris has never seen real poor people as you find in one continent he mentions, Africa. Chris, Africans are more focussed on their next meal, not some assistance from wealthier nations, which basically is a tax on the poor in wealthy countries swelling bank acounts of the rich in poor countries. Ignorance is stong in this one. “Skeptics want to wait until there is 100% certainty before taking action on CAGW, even though in many other areas individuals/families/businesses would never wait until that point before taking action.” I don’t think you are in a position to speak for ‘skeptics’. The C of CAGW has to first be removed as there is no evidence of any. It only exists in some peoples imaginations. Imagining something does not cause it to happen. The A in AGW has first to be demonstrated as to magnitude. The basics of GHG are understood for clear dry atmospheres (as it is explained in schoolbooks). The contribution by A is not, at all, well described or discussed. The story line jumps from simplistic GHG theory to gnome tales. If A makes a contribution to GW, it has proved devilishly difficult to detect. If and when it is detected is not the time to start doing something – we are free to do anything we like any time we like, but no one group in society has a right to impose massive cost and systems of power and control over another just because they think ‘it is time we did something’.  They might one day get that power, but first they will have to provide evidence of A and C. Next is G. G means global and all the evidence we have is that the tropics don’t warm or cool much no matter what the rest of the earth is doing. Is it global warming it the whole world doesn’t warm? Answers on a postcard please because I don’t want to open envelopes. Last is W. If there is no warming in the first place, why are we worrying about it? The long term trend is down from the peak 8000 years ago. The expected long term trend, based on multiple proxy records of previous ice ages, is down. The trend for the past 1000 years is down. The trend for the past 80 years is constant. The trend for the past 20 years is constant. The 8000 year trend is the most important, read together with the patterns from previous ice ages. Ice age cooling is about 10 C. AGW might amount to 1 C. If we are lucky, 2 C. If we could guarantee 3 C we might get back to the conditions in the Sahara where it is all grazing land. Such land can be farmed. The same happens to the Great Gobi Desert when it is warm enough. This might stave off the worst effects of the coming glaciation, it might not. As evidence mounts that the sensitivity to CO2 is small, there is no point in investing in anything other than monitoring. That is the insurance premium we should pay now, and no more. Academics will continue to theorise and match their ideas to observations. That which imperils humankind is unbridled nationalism, materialism and isolationism. Not CO2. ” In fact, it is folks in the poorer regions who are asking for assistance from wealthier countries whose CO2 emissions are going to impact the climate in their countries.” After much arm twisting, no doubt . . ; ) “Unfortunately he did not go on to consider how one would take precautions against the consequences of disbelief in Zorastrianism or Islam, which would be equally dire. But alas, one could not believe in all of them.” Unfortunately for who? It’s a logical treatment, not a theological argument. He set a 50/50 chance (in the logical treatment, not reality-land ; ) for the existence of God. And a: Believe and your in  (if He exists): Disbelieve and you’re not,   super simple risk/reward factor. A sort of “bare bones” set up, for approaching a special form of risk analysis. Islam, for instance is well known not to have such a simple reward factor . . Even Mohamed could not be assured salvation. But, any Muslim can consider the logical treatment, as can any atheist . . I think many people get hung up on their own belief status, and fail to approach the logical treatment itself. But there’s something left out of that set up, which I hope readers will not leave out of their own, so to speak. If an “Abrahamic” sort of God exists, He can, by definition, demonstrate His existence at any time, to anyone. (And can hear them ask ; ) … In fact, it is folks in the poorer regions who are asking for assistance from wealthier countries whose CO2 emissions are going to impact the climate in their countries. If there’s a big pile of money, the people will try to find ways to access it.  If there was a big pile of money devoted to protecting the planet from the zombie apocalypse, people would apply for zombie prevention grants.

Duh, of course the individual poor are not lobbying for climate related assistance. Their governments are. And yes, care needs to be exercised to make sure the monies achieve their intended goals, and don’t end up in official’s pockets. ” In fact, it is folks in the poorer regions who are asking for assistance from wealthier countries whose CO2 emissions are going to impact the climate in their countries.” Not this skeptic.  I want to see something that is outside the normal range of weather.  When the temperatures get hotter than 1934, come back and make your case again.  Until that time, we are still within the normal range of weather and our weather today is very much milder than the extreme 1930’s. I guess you, and many many others, have been mesmerized by the bogus, bastaridzed surface temperature charts into believing we are experiencing unprecedented warming today, but nothing could be further from the truth. Without that bogus surface temperature chart, the promoters of CAGW would have *nothing* use to fool the people.  One dishonest visual does immense damage to humanity and its progress.  Someone ought to pay for this dishonesty.  Besides the taxpayers, I mean. TA, I’m going to wait until we get near the peak temperatures of the recent Climate Optimum, some 3 to 5C warmer than present. Thanks for your clueless post, Patrick. … And yes, care needs to be exercised to make sure the monies achieve their intended goals, and don’t end up in official’s pockets.” Talking of clueless posts, this is a classic, just like all your others. Another empty post by Patrick MJD. All hat and no cattle. This from the poster who just whines about others disagreeing with it. You claim to have presented evidence of too much warmth is a bad thing, and yet they are just modeled projections. In other words, rubbish! BTW, yes I know what it is like to work on a 40c day, without aircon too. We call that normal weather for Australia, in summer. Maybe. It depends on various factors, notably cost and risk. I purchase insurance to cover many perils and self-insure against many others. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, homeowners typically purchase homeowners policies. But many reject earthquake insurance because (1) the premiums are huge and (2) in the event of the “Big One” it’s unlikely that the insurance industry have the assets to meet the claims. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, homeowners typically purchase homeowners policies. But many reject earthquake insurance because (1) the premiums are huge and (2) in the event of the “Big One”…” Most of the damage in 1906 was caused by fires started during the quake and by the fire department. Recent big quakes, the damage was greatest where structures were built on reclaimed land or land that was old landfill. As you say, homeowners can’t afford the insurance for quakes. But like here in Australia, the recent floods in Northern Queensland affected mostly areas that are flood plains, so when it floods, it floods in a big way affecting any property. Locals who live there can’t afford the insurance, so run the risk. Insuring against climate change, as Chris suggests, is simply ridiculous. An asteroid hit will cause far more damage and, I think, is something we could possibly stop. If we wanted to. If the issue is stopping existential threats this is where we should invest our money right now. Climate mitigation begins at $100+ trillion plus. I don’t think it will work. (1) Because it assumes renewable energy, RE, works. Renewable energy is a bad idea in practice. RE systems are intermittent and of low power density. Despite a massive environmental impact nothing indicates they can effectively replace fossil fuels.  RE intermittency has not been solved. (2) Climate mitigation measures will harm economic development; especially in Africa where development is most needed. Nice deflection away from the OP’s main point : climate models do no work, so why should we trust them. Yes, this is spot on. They are desperately in search of a government-funded perpetual hyperproject to give all us plebes some minimum salary work once all the middle class jobs have been offshored/outsourced and automated. As long as you’re going to entertain such philosophical arguments, go back to the original. If God exists, and you risk eternal damnation if you reject God, then you should accept God just in case. After all, eternity is of infinitely more value than anything finite of this world. To believe that man’s use of earth’s resources has somehow frustrated the will of God is very prideful, and according to the ultimate precautionary principle, buying into AGW is too risky to consider. A thing is that God must exist, since existence exists. Contingent existence, such as our material universe, also require the unqualified existence to exist, since these cannot bring themselves into existence. The theological argument is, which one of the various ones humans speak of is the One He that Is (and, logically, there can only be one such with all of the requisite aspects). When you seek this One, and recognize Him, He will make Himself known to you. Don’t try this if you’re trying to mock Him. The ultimate circular argument. You cannot prove an assertion by restating the assertion. Since the God hypothesis explains nothing and makes no testable, falsifiable predictions, it’s not science  There is just as much if not more reason to suppose that existence is simply a property of space-time, or some other purely physical, non-spiritual supposition. Which doesn’t mean that faith in a creator of some kind is necessarily anti-scientific, just that it’s at best a metaphysical belief, not a valid scientific hypothesis. I should add that if God exist, He/She/It would not even want to be discernible or discoverable via the scientific method or any other rational process.  At least in Protestant theology, God has to remain hidden from humans, otherwise faith has no value.  If the existence of such a Being could easily be demonstrated rationally and through evidence, then faith would have no value.  It has to be blind. As Luther said, “In order to be a Christian, one must tear the eyes out of his reason.”  An early Church Father sagely commented, “I believe precisely because it is absurd.” Thus trying to “prove” the existence of God is not only scientifically impossible, but a fundamentally wrong-headed enterprise, theologically. M-Theory isn’t magical, unlike the supernatural conjecture of a spiritual creator being.  It is scientific because it makes testable predictions and looks for confirmation or falsification in observations of nature. Positing a creator is anti-scientific because the “hypothesis” not only can’t make such predictions but because it requires just throwing up your arms and giving up on trying to understand reality.  Such a supposition just moves the problem back to the conjectured being.  Where did It come from? Supposing a creator answers no questions, but merely shuts down whole fields of scientific inquiry as unnecessary, if not blasphemous. As noted above, the Scholastic philosophers were fundamentally wrong-headed in trying to “prove” the existence of God logically.  Not only can it not be done, but the New Testament “God” wouldn’t even want people to try. The concept of “God” of course changes throughout the Old Testament, and then again in the NT.  In Genesis He walks and talks with people.  This jibes with coins showing YHWH riding in a sky chariot, a la Apollo.  Like other Old World gods, He was human in image, but much bigger and of course immortal.  Then in Exodus, He only speaks through natural or quasi-natural phenomena such as storms or burning vegetation.  Yet later in the OT, to see God is to die.  In the NT, He sends not just angelic messengers to earth, but His “Son”.  It’s unclear of course what Jesus actually meant by using that kinship term. In any case, again as mentioned, God has to remain hidden in order for Protestant theology, ie justification by faith alone, to work. Existence is proof of itself. I’m far more likely (in the UK at least) to insure my property if I have a mortgage – in fact my lender will make a condition of the loan. Otherwise I not only lose the equity in my house but continue to owe the bank too. But i note that you ignore your flawed insurance analogy and switch instead to claiming that you know warming is bad. But you still ignore the fact that even if it is bad, we don’t pay more to stop somethng abd than the cost of the bad thing itself, “Huh? They didn’t migrate there, they were born there. So your comment does not make sense. And the vast majority of folks in those countries are not able to emigrate” I am also a “snowbird”, who leaves the frozen midwest to spend time in Phoenix with friends (wealthier than I) who have a winter home there. Most everyone I know there are winter residents from Canada, Wyoming, Iowa, Wisconsin and various other northern states. My siblings all moved to warmer climates right out of college. Chris your narrow and indoctrinated perspective of reality is apparent in your put-downs that substitute for citations and friendly debate. Pop Piasa – I’ve presented evidence that higher temperatures are projected for tropical locations. I’ve projected evidence that increasing temperatures in SE Asia are adversely impacting productivity, and that those impacts will increase with rising temperatures. I’ve lived in the tropics (on the equator) for 20 years, so am personally familiar with tropical climates, unlike most of those who have commented here. There have been roughly 50 comments indicating disagreement with my points. Go ahead and look at them, and tell me how many gave citations. Certainly less than 5. Why don’t you call them out for not giving citations, and erroneously accuse me of that? Regarding your snowbird comments, it’s great that you are able to relocated to get away from cold winters. I lived in Tucson for 4 years so am very familiar with snowbirds. But that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about Phoenix summertime temperatures, not wintertime. And I am talking about working conditions, not retirement. I’ll happily go out and play golf when it’s 95F, but would not want to be working in a garment factory for 12 hours a day at those temperatures. Pop Piasa – I’ve presented evidence that higher temperatures are projected for tropical locations.” Chris, you have presented no evidence that projected temperature increases for tropical locations are in any way valid.  In fact, as others here have noted, those increases are nothing but the output of IPCC climate models that fail every test applied to their past “projections.” Failure to review and acknowledge the many studies listing model failures, while bruiting their “projections,” seems to me to be an exercise in manipulation, not informing others nor in honest argumentation. By the way, the hot season in Vietnam in no way slowed our combat operations.  We wore our boonie hats and drank more water.  Similarly, it didn’t seem to slow down Charlie and the NVA. The discussion is suppose to be about the “hot spot”, and why it has failed to show up as modeled. You have adroitly derailed the discussion to an obtuse sidetrack about insurance. Well done. I would rather discuss the way our fascinating atmosphere works. The more I learn the more wonderful it seems. However, since you insist on discussing insurance, I will ask you, “Would you buy car insurance if you didn’t have a car?” If so, I will sell you hot-spot insurance though we don’t have a hot-spot. To return to the subject of our amazing atmosphere, I can see no sign it has any sort of “topping point” in an upward, hotter direction. Earth has taken some shots over the past billion years or so, but it is like one of those round-bottomed dolls that always bounces back upright, smiling. A tipping-point in a colder direction is another matter, and is something to fret about, if you are so inclined. In fact, once Global Warming flops as a way to tax us all silly, ice-age insurance will be the way to go. Caleb, there are many, many predicted impacts of AGW that have come to pass. 1) Melting of Arctic ice 2) Extreme warming of Arctic air 3) increased severity of rainfall in certain areas 4) melting of glaciers in most regions 5) Earlier arrival of spring, etc. The position of climate skeptics seems to be that unless EVERY predicted outcome of AGW comes to pass, and at EXACTLY the predicted temperatures/sea level rise figure, we should do nothing. Just keep studying and studying. Except of course, that many skeptics on this site are cheering Trump’s planned cuts to science agencies, which means we won’t even be gathering the data that helps us to measure the changes that are happening. All you need to do is trace the routes the earlier explorers took in wooden sailing ships without engines, and it is obvious the waters were relatively ice-free during the latter half of the summer. For example, in 1819 William Parry sailed past 110° W in the channel that now bears his name. How often is that now possible? (Answer: Last summer was one of the few recent summers it could have been done, hugging the coast of Melville Island to the north, and that was only possible during a window-of-opportunity of roughly ten days.) There are other examples of whalers getting pretty far north during that low-ice time (roughly  1805-1820) as well, and some kept amazingly accurate logs. It may have been their overly sanguine concept of how little ice there was up there that contributed to the Franklin tragedy later. (And Franklin made it pretty far north as well.) A simple understanding of sailing and brief perusal of history should be enough to convince you that some recent “studies”, which portray the arctic as totally ice-bound until recently, are pure poppycock. As far as 2.) is concerned, we know very little about air temperatures in the arctic in the past, so how can we say if the current meridional pattern’s warming is “extreme” or not? When you do so poorly on things I know about, I lack confidence when you speak of things I don’t, such as 3.), 4.), 5.), etc. Chris, every one of your lines of “evidence” is also completely explained by the AMO cycle. The AMO cycle also explains why we cooled from 1945-1980 which CAGW theory does not. You are in denial. Richard, AMO does not explain the record breaking high temperatures in the Arctic – as much as 20C higher than normal. You are in denial. So Chris is in favour of more ice,cold air,growing glaciers and later springs. I live in Canada, the second coldest country on the planet. None of those things appeal to me, nor to the many farmers who endeavour to feed the planet through a limited growing season. Additionally, a colder planet is a drier planet, where millions go hungry and poverty rules.So eager to save the planet that there’s no time to think about reality! Chris:  It’s snowing here in Wyoming and forecast to hit 22° F tonight and to snow some more tomorrow.  My daffodils will undoubtedly have frozen blooms, as did the cherry blossoms in DC this year.  Now, before you object that this is just one year, it was also in the 50 and 60°F range a week ago.  It snows until June here on a regular basis.  So, what is an “earlier spring”?  When it warms to room temperature outside and stays there?  When the snow storms stop?   Is this everywhere or like most warming predictions, it’s local and no one can predict which areas will get what changes?  I’m not seeing any reason to worry.  Climate and weather vary widely over the globe.  Until such time local predictions can be made with accuracy, there’s no way to know if the outcomes should be feared or cheered. The Arctic has not been that much warmer everywhere all winter.  Far from it. This winter saw another common weather pattern, more frequent during winters after super El Ninos.  Cold air from the Arctic falls down into the NH temperate zone, bringing unusual cold and moisture.  Many places broke cold records during 2016-17. It’s just weather.  And the sea ice extent is just ocean currents following a super El Nino. And, BTW, Arctic sea ice is headed for the 2SD normal zone this month. http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/ What happened, as climate realists predicted, is that the marginal areas that didn’t freeze over are those which would have melted first anyway.  The more interior areas are liable thaw at more or less the normal rate and times. Contrary to Griff’s forecast of Arctic sea ice extent “sure” to be lower all year and to set a new record low this summer. John Farnsworth said: “So Chris is in favour of more ice,cold air,growing glaciers and later springs. I live in Canada, the second coldest country on the planet. None of those things appeal to me, nor to the many farmers who endeavour to feed the planet through a limited growing season.” John, when did I say I want a colder planet? Not wanting the planet to warm is not the same as wanting it to be colder. Canada has 30M people.  2.8 billion people live in the tropics, or nearly 100X the population of Canada. People living in the tropics would benefit from more rainfall, if it came at the right time. There cannot be any doubt that a warmer world is a better world.  Even moreso is it true that more CO2 is better.  Four hundred ppm is much better than 280, but 800 ppm would be even better and 1200 ppm best of all. Arrhenius and Callendar both were convinced that AGW would improve the world.  They were right, except that AGW is not in evidence. Richard, AMO does not explain the record breaking high temperatures in the Arctic – as much as 20C higher than normal. You are in denial.” The precautionary principle is a fallacy. It gives policy preference to the person wheeling out the most lurid parade of horribles while ignoring any kind of cost-benefit analysis. Worse, the precautionary principle is more like “chicken little”—if the sky COULD be falling or someone shouts it is falling, we must act even without strong evidence or possibly any evidence.  It’s the scientific equivalent of “the charges are so serious, action must be taken”. We don’t take out Earthquake insurance here in New Orleans, but you’d be a fool not to have hurricane coverage except for the lucky few on high ground, you better have good flood coverage as well. No one practices precaution like insurance companies. Warren Buffet has stated that his insurance business is not seeing any greater impact from adverse weather, nor are they having to raise premiums to cover climate change risks. Maybe Chris knows more about risk than Warren Buffet? Now there’s an apt analogy. /sarc In CA earthquake insurance in Sacramento has a deductible of $50K, in a low seismic zone, that is a non-starter. It depends on how much the insurance costs and how much it helps in a scenario. Adapt if too expensive to mitigate. You find destroying the world’s economy and reverting to the Stone Age analogous to buying insurance?  “Renewables” such as wind and solar are not ready to support the energy needs of even poor countries, much less the big ones.  Germany has done significant damage to their own economy due to their guilt-stricken “Energiewend” program, many factories have been transferred to other less foolish regimes. China and India are building coal-fired power plants just as fast as they can. You posted first, indicating that you were monitoring the site to make sure your employer sees that you are trolling as he has requested.   What a waste of time your comments are, nothing more… Michael Moon,  so whoever posts first is a paid commenter? Unless of course, they are a skeptic, then that rule does not apply. What a ludicrous comment. Tin foil hats on sale on aisle 3. We are not all agreed that a) the outcome is clearly catastrophic and b) the cost of avoidance is a worthy investment.   It may be that the cost of mitigation in the future is the better choice. Your analogy doesn’t really make sense.  Why would you take out fire insurance if what you needed was flood insurance because your property was in a desert wash?  To insure your car keeps running, are you willing to go out and buy a new engine and transmission for your car because you might blow a tire? Since it is NOT clear what the thousands of drivers of the climate are, how can you “insure” against them?  Choosing carbon dioxide makes no more sense than deciding that you have to ban Christmas because people burn dead Christmas trees. Actually the insurance analogy is excellent but not for the reasons the OP proposed. All insurance that I know of is regulated and all insurance relations that I know of prohibit insurance companies from selling insurance when there is no insurable interest. That is, no actual loss will occur. For instance, I am not married, I have no children nor other beneficiaries therefore no one will suffer or be negatively impacted by the loss of my income if I were do die. There is no insurable interest there. Entities not subject to financial loss from an event do not have an insurable interest and cannot purchase an insurance policy to cover that event. Until it is established that AGW is in fact occurring and that the occurrence of such will have a negative financial impact on someone, there is no insurable interest, no predicted loss will occur and no insurance should be purchased to cover the (non) event. The Democrats on the panel would counter this rational post by pointing to the 97% consensus. Their aversion to engaging the scientific issues and uncertainties was remarkable. The origin of the 97% consensus, a Limerick. and blame CO2, they’re hell-bent. with the explanation to the origin of the 97% myth https://lenbilen.com/2017/02/26/the-origin-of-the-97-consensus-a-limerick/ Not only is the97% consensus an engineered result, the consensus itself is nothing like what activists are claiming it means. On the first survey that started the 97% nonsense, I probably would have answered yes to both questions. On Question One, ie whether earth has warmed since AD 1850, I would agree.  But most of that warming occurred before the rapid rise in CO2 late in the last century.  For that and a host of other reasons, I would not have answered yes to the second question, ie whether humans are “significantly” responsible for whatever warming might have occurred during that interval, unless there be a very low threshold for “significance”. Doran and Zimmerman (2009) didn’t even ask the critical third question, ie whether whatever warming has occurred from whatever causes is a good thing or a bad thing.  Same for the increase in CO2 itself. Issues quite apart from their cherry-picking 79 out of 3146 respondents in order to achieve 97% accord on Question One. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/12/10/an-oopsie-in-the-doranzimmerman-97-consensus-claim/ I vote for the precautionary principle. Maybe there are no gnomes under the ice caps, but I think that we should spend several trillion dollars to mitigate their effects, because if there are gnomes down there, the results could be devastating. Even young Danforth, with his nervous breakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors—indeed, as I have said, there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me, though I think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so. It might explain and relieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after those rare irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to me—things which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself again. You will go broke before you can pay for all the possible precautions. Bingo. That’s the idea. The West is being swallowed up by debt .It’s not a possibility, it’s a dead certainty! What precautions are recommended? The same morons who advocate for AGW mitigation tell us the answer is to borrow more! Forrest:  Probably.  Just use the words you find to accurately convey your sentiment and let it go into moderation.  Words have meanings and some words can’t be easily changed out without losing the meaning. Imo, there could be a lag generated by the heat stored in the oceans before a cooling trend becomes apparent. I say that in regard to my attempts to predict ENSO region changes. I was having some success until the El Nino firmly set in place. In thinking about that, it seemed that the reason why is that above average heat loads do not dissipate that quickly. That is likely fortunate for life on the planet as it is a basis for stability in the climate system. Svensmark does not consider that there is a lag. So ‘there could be a lag’ is not part of ‘growing evidence’. And when you track back and find when they start to deviate – you find the same deviation between land and sea and north and south hemisphere – and it is far from global and there NOT CO2 induced GLOBAL warming. Because you know what – if it were CO2, it’d be global and it wouldn’t suddenly start – at a date that just happens to coincide with the introduction of clean air acts across the globe. That it is not CO2 does not automatic mean it is the discredited Svensmark hypothesis. so desperate to prove that its CO2 that you pre-empted your manipulation of solar data, by about 2 years. History is what it is. I agree with your premise. I have a guess at perhaps one reason that the presentation of this topic did not generate more of a reaction. I wonder if the graphic presented was perhaps a little too technical and not enough time was spent explaining what was being depicted. Scientists and engineers would have no problem quickly grasping that graphic, but a non-technical audience may have been less able to understand it quickly without more explanation. The whole hearing seemed to be ultra-political. One side says “A”. The other side says “B”. That was not an open exchange of opinions or ideas. My overall impression is that the hearing was dysfunctional and achieved very little. That’s just my take; perhaps someone else has a better or more accurate perspective on the political aspects of the hearing. Don’t get me wrong — I’m glad that (what I consider to be) honest science is finally getting some visibility.  I’m just saying… The positive side to the hearing was that it was obvious that some of the congresspersons have spent the time to become better informed on this subject. That is a big plus in my book. Then there were those who agreed with the alarmist position who clearly show that they have no comprehension on the subject at hand, but will spout all of the talking points.  I think that the informed position will win out at the end of the day. If you’re truly worried about the plight of humans living 100 years from now due to a few degrees of temperature increase, I suggest you turn your concern to the plight of humans living right now. I refer to the hundreds of thousands fleeing the Middle East and seeking refuge in Europe. They need your concern and that of the scores of climate experts who spend their time worrying about what might eventually occur at some time nearly a century away when they will all be dead and gone. It’s not Gnomes, it’s Leprechauns under the Polar Ice causing the heating.  Leprechauns can make themselves invisible, which explains why they avoid detection.  This also explains the missing hot spot and greater heating in the Northern Hemisphere, as Leprechauns come from Ireland and holiday there too. “For example one theory is the balloon measurements are not being analysed correctly, so the hotspot is there, but it is evading detection unless you properly homogenise the data.” Yes, and homogenisation is very important. It’s not like surface, where you have a thermometer in one place that you can look at whenever you want. With balloons, you get a snapshot of ever different trajectories, once a day at best, and with poor geographic spread, especially  in the tropics. And they go on to provide details. The conclusions “In summary, most, though not all, CMIP3 and CMIP5 models overestimate the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere during the satellite period 1979–2012. Roughly one-half to two-thirds of this difference from the observed trend is due to an overestimate of the SST trend, which is propagated upward because models attempt to maintain static stability. There is low confidence in these assessments, however, due to the low confidence in observed tropical tropospheric trend rates and vertical structure (Section 2.4.4). “ So some models may be right, or close to right, for the wrong reasons?  Let’s take a mean. All models are wrong, or close to wrong, for unknown reasons. Averaging would make them more wrong. If you look at CMIP5, all the models are wrong.  Most are very, very wrong.  Some (outliers) are closer (as in less wrong).  But climate “scientists” don’t use those, only the ones that show the “right” amount of warming. Excellent.  After being told repeatedly in the 90’s and early 2000’s that the warming could NOT be noise because it was TOO BIG to be noise and so HAD to be AGW, now we’re being told that the noise is bigger than the warming after all.  Sigh.  Can’t argue with a position that won’t stay still and actually be a position. Different signal. I’m talking, as is Eric, about the tropical hotspot fingerprint. I’m talking, as is Eric, about the tropical hotspot fingerprint. Same difference.  It was supposed to leap out at us and “prove” the theory, now we can’t find it and the excuse is that the noise is SO much bigger. Well, if it’s too close to the beach property, sure there is someone selling an insurance for that too. If a signal is insignificantly greater than the noise in a system, that signal will have an insignificant effect upon the system. This is exactly what skeptics have been saying all along: CO2 warming is present, but insignificant. CO2 warming is nothing to sweat about! Nobody is saying that the tropical hotspot is important because of its effect on the system. It is supposed to be an indicator. And if there is too much noise, it is not a useful indicator. That is all. “…if there is too much noise, it is not a useful indicator. That is all.” Ha ha ha Nick, you’re too much. It may not be “a useful indicator” or it may not be an indicator at all. Doesn’t Ockham’s razor demand we assume the latter, and that we should avoid  the former? “Nullius in clamitatio!” Nobody is saying that the tropical hotspot is important because of its effect on the system. It is supposed to be an indicator. And if there is too much noise, it is not a useful indicator. That is all. Please note that the ‘hotspot’ is a rate of warming at altitude in the tropics which is 2 to 3 times greater than the rate of warming at the surface.  If we cannot detect the ‘hotspot’ then it is unreasonable to think AGW will be sufficiently large for it to have discernible effects at the surface (i.e. where people live) which has more “noise” than where the hotspot is predicted.. The pertinent item for information on the ‘hotspot’ is Chapter 9 of IPCC WG1 AR4 and specifically Figure 9.1 Only Figures 9.1(c) and 9.1(f) show the ‘hot spot’. In other words, the ‘hot spot’ is a unique effect of “well mixed greenhouse gases” predicted by the PCM model the IPCC approves. And that effect is so great that the model predicts it has overwhelmed all the other significant forcings. But as the above article by Eric Worrall says, the ‘hot spot’ has not occurred, and this is indicated by independent measurements obtained by radisondes mounted on balloons (since 1958) and by MSU mounted on satellites (since 1979). This is a classic. Models generally say X, but we are lucky enough and some don’t say so. If we observe X we are right (we have found a smoking gun), and if we don’t observe it we are not wrong. In all these cases, which there are plenty, they never tell what other differences happen between the models which say X and those saying not-X. So, when convenient we have the model’s mean, and when not we have diverging lines of evidence. This graph is from Gavin Schmidt; the coloring is mine. If using the argument “some models say X and some don’t”, the first thing to ask is whether they differ in ECS or some other relevant metric. And why models differ so much. Observations differ from 0 to 0,2 degrees / decade; models from 0,1 to almost 0,5. So, we decide observations must be wrong, and *some* models are OK. What’s not to like? AFAIK the tropical “hotspot” in the troposphere is the result of every warming, not only the impact of radiative GHG forcing. So if the hotspot is smaller than predicted (as the latest Santer-paper shows) this does not mean that the warming was NOT due to GHG but the warming was smaller ( 1.7:1 Models vs. observed) than the mean of the models estimate. AFAIK the tropical “hotspot” in the troposphere is the result of every warming, not only the impact of radiative GHG forcing. So if the hotspot is smaller than predicted (as the latest Santer-paper shows) this does not mean that the warming was NOT due to GHG but the warming was smaller ( 1.7:1 Models vs. observed) than the mean of the models estimate. I explain your error by iterating and adding to the footnote of my above post addressed to Nick Stokes. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) explicitly states that your assertions are mistaken.  The pertinent item is Chapter 9 of IPCC WG1 AR4 and specifically Figure 9.1 Only Figures 9.1(c) and 9.1(f) show the ‘hot spot’. In other words, the ‘hot spot’ is a unique effect of “well mixed greenhouse gases” predicted by the PCM model the IPCC approves. And that effect is so great that the model predicts it has overwhelmed all the other significant forcings. But the ‘hot spot’ has not occurred, and this is indicated by independent measurements obtained by radisondes mounted on balloons (since 1958) and by MSU mounted on satellites (since 1979). Points 1 to 5 are are known as the Water Vapour Feedback (WVF).  The direct effect on global temperature from a doubling of CO2 in the air would be about 1 °C.  And (according to e.g. IPCC) the effect of the WVF is to increase this warming to between 3 and 6.5 °C. Clearly, there are large assumptions in calculation of the WVF:  this is undeniable because the range of its calculated effect effect is so large (i.e. to increase warming of from ~1 °C to to a warming in the range 3 to 6.5 °C). One of the assumptions is how much water vapour is held in the atmosphere and where it is distributed.  Large effects of the WVF are induced by assumption of large increase to water vapour at altitude. Temperature also decreases with altitude and, therefore, the ability of the atmosphere to hold water vapour decreases with altitude.  So, small increase to temperature with altitude permits the air at altitude to hold more water.  And, therefore, enables WVF at altitude. The increase to WVF with altitude causes largest increase to radiative forcing (so largest increase to temperature) at altitude.  And the radiative forcing effect is strongest in the tropics so the largest increase to temperature at altitude is in the tropics. This ‘largest increase to temperature at altitude is in the tropics’ is the ‘hot spot’.  But the ‘hot spot’ is missing. Whichever of these possibilities is the true, the absence of the ‘hot spot’ demonstrates that the estimates of 3 to 6.5 °C for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 are too high because the effect which induces enhancement of the direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 is absent.  So, only the direct warming of ~1 °C from a doubling of CO2 can be justified. I hope this explanation is clear. It is very clear that you don’t understand the stuff you are parroting on behalf of whomever pays you. I fully understand the physics of the tropospheric ‘hotspot’ and took the trouble to explain it for you. “However, the reason for the ‘hot spot’ is not unique to anthropogenic warming and is as follows.” It is expected that ANY WARMING at the surface will be amplified in the upper troposphere. DISPUTE MY EXPLANATION IF YOU CAN BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE READ IT STOP PARROTING NONSENSE. what it shows is that the process the models use is wrong. it is as simple as that. for the models to have correct weighting, but just be wrong on the outcome as you suggest, they would be forced to remove the water vapour feedback component used (from ANY warming). since surface warming is occurring, yet the hotspot is not, then the function of the feedback cannot be as the modelers portray. the satellites etc show clearly less water vapour in the upper troposphere than the models predict. the models predict this based on feedback the authors plug in. the reality is that the models are so wrong about the co2 climate sensitivity because of this. the lack of a hot spot proves that beyond doubt. of course the lack of the hot spot does not determine the cause of the warming, but it puts beyond doubt the lack of understanding of the climate system the modelers have, and the robustness of any result from their models. Richard: Your shouting is a little bit boring indeed! Foremost it dosen’t change much on physics! How do you think the upper troposphere could decide from which source the warming comes and responses in another way to the warming from GHG or other possibilities?? Another possibility would be that the models overestimate the water vapour feedback just as it assumes “mohbici”. This is a nobel option and this could solve the problem that the hotspot is much smaller than estimated. But ( a great But): this would be the case also for EVERY warming. The smaller warming of the upper tropic troposphere than expected is NOT a sign of no warming due to GHG but perhaps a sign of an overestimation of wv-feedback due to every warming. And please: cool down and stop shouting. It makes your posts ugly. All of the climate models predict the Tropical Troposphere Hotpot in almost exactly the same way.  It is scary how similar the numbers are.. It is almost like they all copied the code from the original climate model or they are all building in the same effect regardless if their model does something different. They are ALL tightly centred on producing 27.2% more warming in the 2TLT tropics troposphere than at the tropics surface.  Its like a “miracle” that all these independent models would have such a tight dispersion around this value. The right panel from Thorne et al 2011. http://trac.arl.noaa.gov/documents/JournalPDFs/ThorneEtAl.WIREs2010.pdf 2. They uniformly predict things that don’t happen.  No mid-troposphere hot spot, no global warming for the last 20 years. * Conduction at the surface warms the atmosphere, which then carries that heat upwards and outwards by convection.  Look at how thunderclouds form in America’s grain belt. UAH Tropics Troposphere is just 0.03C in  March 2017.  That would not exactly be a “Hotspot”. This is the last down-dip from the 2015-16 Super El Nino so this would be more-or-less ENSO neutral now.  There is still a small positive impact from the AMO but that is for another day. Yes, and homogenisation is very important. It’s not like surface, where you have a thermometer in one place that you can look at whenever you want. With balloons, you get a snapshot of ever different trajectories, once a day at best, and with poor geographic spread, especially in the tropics. ARGO by comparison is once every 10 days with different trajectories and is sparse. But it seems to manage to measure temperature changes to the degree we can see trends. Forrest Gardener: You said: “Nick is there any part of the consensus science which you will not defend?” Nick’s defenses are, for the most part, reasoned and polite. A lot better than I can say about many on either side of this debate. I encourage Nick to continue to post his rebuttals here as it provides a forum to test a point of view and it proves that reasoned debate is acceptable to at least one side of this argument. Regarding this thread, his point about “thickness” of the atmosphere is dead on. It isn’t absolute distance or concentration that is important in radiative absorption, but the product of the two. As such, an atmosphere at 100 kPa and 400 ppm CO2 will have the same radiative impact whether is is cold and thinner or warm and thicker. Mosher probably got tired of the knee jerk tirades against him. He still posts regularly at Dr. Curry’s sight. Nick is right that the tropopause is higher in the tropics not because of centrifugal force but because the atmosphere is warmer in the tropics. However, “That is a signal/noise issue. It doesn’t necessarily mean the signal is weak, more that the noise is strong.” If the noise swamps the signal, the signal is, by definition, weak. “…homogenisation is very important. It’s not like surface, where you have a thermometer in one place that you can look at whenever you want. With balloons, you get a snapshot of ever different trajectories, once a day at best, and with poor geographic spread, especially in the tropics.” You have made an assertion that homogenization is important, but your reasons for it  is because of sketchy incomplete data.  I assert that no matter what you do with  sketchy incomplete data, you’ll end with sketchy, incomplete data.  Hard to make good jewelry starting out with tin. I wouldn’t try it anyways. Actually, warm air does rise, Nick, but a fluid flows under the influence of the spin as well.  It may not be huge, but it will be there, and you know that as well.  Why pretend it isn’t?  As for the “hot spot,” I have seen enough references to it, and enough “lame” defenses of its not being there, to know that here lies something that you “deniers” want no one to look at in the first place.  It IS nice to see you tell me that the program models didn’t estimate it correctly.  Having pointed out the fact that the models blew it on yet another point is enough to make me question the rest of their “predictions.” Typically, only in baseball does it take 3 strikes to create an out.  I would have to say that in the real world, if I was counting on an analyst to give me accurate information to bet a fortune on, he wouldn’t be around after the 2nd blown prediction, but you folks want the world to bet a fortune on something that has predicted nothing with accuracy.  Be honest.  Climate is basically “long term weather,” or there wouldn’t be a lot of noise about “extreme weather.”  Since you can’t predict weather 100 days in advance that I can count on, why would I believe you could predict climate 100 years from now? Forrest: It would be better if you left the anger and hatred to those whom you disagree with. The CO2 wars have nothing to do with science. They have everything to do with control. The appropriate question for Nick is why he wishes to see the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. He continues to advocate for policies that accomplish both. His science is fairly well thought out. The consequences of following his preferred actions. Not so much. “nobody has yet managed to unequivocally detect that predicted hotspot.” Remember how the pause was causing an epidemic of climate blues among climateers of a certain age because of classic psychological деиуал. They couldn’t face the fact that they may have spent half a lifetime in useless work so they rationalized that they were ill because they saw the end of the world happening and no one would listen. What did they do about this elephant in the room? They got a guy about to retire to just jerry-build the record to erase this terrible pause. Believe it, they are going to torpedo this very embarrassing hot spot problem. Let’s see, Trenberth is about 70 now, ready for retirement and he has been chasing hot spots for about half a dozen years. He will take one for the team, retire on a fat pension and maybe push the end game past the end of his life. The paper that brought out ERSST V4 was Huang et al, 2015. Karl was not an author. Which is why the Obama administration barely said anything about it.  Oh wait…. Oh don’t be precious.  They were yelling about it before the ink was dry.   They jumped on it so fast that people smelled a rat and started asking questions as to coordination between Karl and White House for political purposes.  Congressional committees were asking for email records and were defied.  Gimme a break Nick. The time to abandon a failed model is ASAP.  Hubris of the sunk cost eats at the soul of every Don Quxiote but realize said sunk cost is GONE.  Accept failure, learn from it and drive on. While my education background is physics, I received far more liberal arts and classics AND APPLY IT.  For the record, Keynes was a hack who was perverted by Fabians who were nihlists attacking the Austrian School. http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1# You can’t find the hotspot because the gnomes are dispersing the warm air before it gets warm enough to be detected.  The gnomes are in balloons, high in the atmosphere, and are using big fans to waft the warm air to the poles. Leprechauns dispersing the hot air produced by the gnomes makes more sense. Eric, Willis didn’t convincing prove anything about the sun’s climate control. In 2014/15 I put together a working solar climate model which I used to predict in 2015 the temperature drop in 2016 from lower TSI in 2016 to ultimately within 3% error. Variable solar radiation, ie TSI, is responsible for warming and cooling, not CO2 or cosmic rays. Cosmic ray theory is as bad as CO2 theory – no real-world real-time supporting evidence. I have a solar theory that works!  It’s a mathematical model based strictly on the relationships between SSN, F10.7, TSI, and SST/OHC. I can and will convincingly prove that the sun controls the weather and climate, using simple code and basic empirically data derived rules of solar sensitivity, furthermore, I will provide evidence that strongly suggests that all the rapid warm-ups during the Holocene were solar driven, and to top it off, will unveil a prediction system based on long-term solar activity forecasts. As for Willis’ failures, don’t take it so hard.  Most people who used similar ideas also failed, because one basic rule to know that wasn’t is temps aren’t going to be the highest on the day of the highest SSN or TSI,ie, that a solar driven temperature rise from a SSN/TSI spike is registered after the fact of the higher solar activity, for reasons I’ll get deeper into in my solar paper. The simple fact is ‘global warming’ since 1850 (or any other time) was a result of high solar activity that persisted for decades. Sunspot activity was 65% higher for 70 years from 1935 to 2004, the end of the modern maximum, than for the previous 70 years from 1865 to 1934, annual averages of 108.5 vs 65.8.  The sun was hotter for 70 years. The IPCC, Leif, and Willis apparently all think the earth can absorb higher solar radiation for 70 years without warming up. The hotspot isn’t there because their theory is wrong.  CO2 does not control the climate, the sun does. Bob, furthermore, willis’ link compares the solar cycle to sea level rise data. (hardly what one would call “convincing”) Even svalgaard is in agreement that there is .1C swing in temperature during the solar cycle. It’s just a matter, then, of ascertaining whether or not sustained higher solar activity causes further warming… Afonzarelli, the 0.1C solar swing is a standardized version of reality – every cycle is different, thus the temperature signature of each solar cycle will vary from the extremes, duration, and proportion of high vs low TSI over time during each cycle. I think part of the IPCC and others’ problem(s) is treating all cycles as though they are the same. silly comments without supporting evidence are just pollution of WUWT. “As the TSI variation is so small, its impact on climate will also be small.” …is the first wrong assumption. Failure to pay attention to daily TSI variation and what it is doing to the earth is everyone’s loss. I agree with you on the CDR.  If you recall it was I who dug up their discrepancy with SORCE. SORCE is running hot now, as you know.  It’s 15% higher now in its variation off the ’03-15 statistical norm, typically 0.1 to 0.15 W/m^2 higher than that ‘norm’ for recent post-cycle max F10.7cm flux, yet not outside the bounds of prior activity. Leif to me the silly comments are those made in defiance of all logic and common sense, such as your oft-stated comments that solar variation doesn’t cause net temperatures changes over the course of several very active cycles. You have to be silly to believe in your’s and IPCC’s fairy tale that the earth does not respond to solar activity. Failure to pay attention to daily TSI variation and what it is doing to the earth is everyone’s loss. “Nonsense. Climate is a 30-year average. Daily variation is irrelevant on that scale.” You will never understand why your’s and the IPCC’s solar perspective is wrong by ignoring daily variations. To me you and the IPCC are not even being the least bit scientific. You should always start with your input power and see what happens with variations in that first, not make all these grand theories and force everyone into a faulty position, which you and the IPCC do wrt the sun. Every day TSI leaves a distinct terrestrial signature.  I’ll tell what they are in my paper. Your assumptions are faulty.  Daily variations don’t just matter – they’re just as essential to understanding climate as is long term data. You are lost in your own sophistry Leif. It has the advantage, and disadvantage, that it is not human-caused.  Advantage, because it means we don’t need to spend trillions in a futile attempt to destroy the world’s economy.  I mean cut CO2 output & thereby save the world. Disadvantage, because it means we don’t need to spend trillions in a futile attempt to destroy the world’s economy.  I mean cut CO2 output & thereby save the world. You listed 3 causes of global warming, then admitted that we really don’t know  what drives the climate.. I have identified the cause in my post Climate Change Deciphered.  Google it. If you don’t agree, then refute it. Or a URL. O.K. Here’s the abstract: “New observations conclusively prove ALL of the anomalous warming that has occurred from 1975-present has been due to the removal of dimming Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) aerosols from the troposphere, either due to business recessions, or to EPA-driven Clean Air efforts. With all of the warming accounted for by the reduction in SO2 emissions, there can never have been any additional warming due to Carbon Dioxide (CO2) or other “greenhouse gasses”. You will have to do some searching if I give you the site URL.  However, simply Googling “Climate Change Deciphered”  will take you directly to the essay. I agree very much with the points made, but I feel they are vastly understated. The tropical tropospheric hotspot is not a central part of AGW theory.  It depends on the water vapor feedback being as strongly positive as predicted by no change in global atmpsheric relative humidity, along with a positive feedback from change in cloud albedo. I think that positive cloud albedo feedback requires (from warming) decrease of global average atmospheric relative humidity, so that the combo of water vapor and cloud albedo feedbacks is the same as (maybe slightly less than) the water vapor feedback alone would be with constant global tropospheric relative humidity.  The tropical upper troposphere hotspot of warming depends on a great increase of water vapor in the tropical troposphere causing a reduction of the wet adiabatic lapse rate in the tropical troposphere, as I see this. The climate models appear to me as poorly tuned rather than totally wrong.  I see the climate models as being tuned to hindcast mostly 1975-2005 without consideration of a natural cycle or cycle set that shows up in most global surface temperature datasets, especially global surface temperature datasets that don’t use a recent American outlier sea surface temperature dataset.  (ERSSTv4, or maybe also the recent “high res” variant of Reynolds OI.) It seems to me that climate models, if they were tuned to have manmade warming from 1975 to 2005 being about .2-.22 degree C less than “determined” in the CMIP5 and similar ones, would predict a tropical upper troposphere warming hotspot so minimal that measurements failing to show it are not statistically significantly different from having shown such a small extent of it existing. It seems to me that climate models, if they were tuned to have manmade warming from 1975 to 2005 being about .2-.22 degree C less than “determined” in the CMIP5 and similar ones, would predict a tropical upper troposphere warming hotspot so minimal that measurements failing to show it are not statistically significantly different from having shown such a small extent of it existing. Unfortunately it also seems to me that they would then utterly fail to explain the warming from 1975 to 1998. In  the end the point is far more serious and cannot be fudged: you can’t fit a smooth logarithmic relationship between CO2 and temperature to a data set shaped like a mesa. And that is the real point: To fit the early part requires high climate sensitivity and implies a significant hotspot. to fit the later part requires a much lower sensitivity, to the point where co2 induced warming is of academic interest only. This is the elephant in the room: All attempts to ‘save’ AGW result in it becoming less catastrophic with every year that passes. And politically, mild to insignificant man made global warming is as useful as a chocolate tea pot. If it is ‘saved’ to fit the data, it’s not alarming. If it stays alarming it doesn’t fit the data. The only way to save the theory and keep it alarming is to fix the data. Go figure. Albedo from clouds is secondary to the primary heat transfer from evaporation.  Water vapor is strongly bouyant.  Enthalpy of vaporization is also very high thanks to hydrogen bonding. Global relative humidity?  PLEASE?  How about global PRECIPITATION!!!  But also virga?  Clouds are often signs of intense heat transfer with their altitude being a “hole” through insulation.  Model these as Perkins Tubes ( a type of heat pipe which is gravity assisted). Leo smith:  The effect of CO2 can’t be made to fit all the data because it is not the only factor.  There is a natural cycle, that (even if only temporarily) had a period around 64 years and a peak-to-peak amplitude around .2-.22 degree C.  It was on an upswing from the early-mid 1970s to around 2005, and has been on a downswing since.  If the CMIP5 models get toned down so as to underhindcast by about .2-.22 degree C the warming from the early 1970s to 2005, and then a sinusoid with peak-to-peak amplitude of .2 degree C and period of 64 years and peak at 2005 is added to such a fixed CMIP5 output, then such a fixed CMIP5 forecast would be reasonably accurate as long as the natural cycle’s amplitude and frequency holds up. Precisely.  Google “Climate Change Deciphered” for the actual cause of the warming. The atmosphere is only slightly thicker over the equator than at the poles, but the troposphere is a lot thicker over the equator than at the poles.  This is because around the equator is where widespread warm ocean favors tall tropical thunderstorms and systems of them (such as tropical cyclones) favors convection to higher altitudes.  The tropopause is generally below the 300 millibar level in polar areas in winter and around the spring equinox, and generally around or above the 100 millibar level in tropical areas where tropical weather is prevailing.  The altitude of the tropopause is often around or below 8 km above sea level in polar areas in winter and around the spring equinox, and gets as high as around 20 km in the tropics.  This difference is not mostly explained by thermal expansion from absolute temperature through the troposphere being 25-30% higher in hot tropical areas than in cold polar areas, and it is not explained by the equator having centrifugal force around .5 % of equatorial gravity – even at 20 km above sea level. It was the reference to ‘centrifugal force’ to explain the higher tropopause at the equator which horrified me. My high-school physics teacher would have been flexing his ruler, for a swift tap over the knuckles. A very simple prediction of global warming is that the atmosphere will expand – in effect the atmosphere acts as a temperature gauge. This means that we should find the same pressure levels significantly higher up in the atmosphere. If anything the evidence actually suggests cooling. Can you give citations for trend in global-average height of the 500 millibar level or any of the other major-noted troposphere pressure levels (or an around-tropopause one) such as 300, 700, or 850 millibar levels to cite cooling?  Please keep in mind that about 70% of the mass of Earth’s atmosphere is under the 300 millibar level, and about half is under the 500 millibar level. Since we do not know if the climate will be warmer or colder on the long run, we don’t know which insurance we need. Against cold or warm? Or both? And if we get an ice age, what do we make with a bundle of money? How long does a fire last from a bunch of Dollars. Since Willis didn’t write this article, you’ll be a long time waiting for a reply. 😉 All of the heat feedback theories are completely disproved by tge fact that we’ve gad as high or higher temperatures before, and no feedback has ever occurred. This is the major cornerstone of the alarmist CAGW cult, and it is so obviously erroneous, it almost hurts to hear it. This is so obviously correct but almost nothing is made of it, yet that’s the ‘runaway’ warming theory FALSIFIED right there. You could almost say it kills 97% of scary AGW predictions. It really should be the killer stat’ that puts AGW to bed for good. The big problem I see in climate models such as most of the CMIP5 ones and their likes:  They were tuned to hindcast the past, and the CMIP5 ones have their transition from hindcast to forecast being at the transition from 2005 to 2006.  And they were tuned with extra concentration on 1975-2005 as what to hindcast correctly, using factors that exclude natural cycles such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and a likely loosely-linked Pacific item that shows up in multi-year-smoothed ENSO indexes and the versions of PDO index that have better correlation with multi-year-smoothed ENSO.  So, the way I see it, the climate models consider about .2-.22 degree C of the warming from 1975 to 2005 as being manmade but I see that amount of warming in 1975-2005 as from a natural cycle or set of natural cycles. Something I suggest looking at:  Use Woodfortrees and use any global temperature dataset other than the American ones that use the outlier “Karl Pausebuster” ERSSTv4 for sea component.  Choose a start date anytime from 1972 to 1979, endpoint date anytime from 2013.5 to latest available as of now, and midpoint between two linear trends anywhere from 1997 to 2006.  Choose a midpoint date that gets the two linear trends to have ends meeting.  When I have done this, I mostly came up with 2003-2004, sometimes early 2005 as being when the Pause/Slowdown started.  And have a look at the periodic cycle whose period is around 64 years that shows up in all global surface temperature datasets with start date no later than 1900, especially ones other than modern American ones that use ERSSTv4.  I favor HadCRUT from the UK as being “least overcooked”. They were tuned to hindcast the past, and the CMIP5 ones have their transition from hindcast to forecast being at the transition from 2005 to 2006. And they were tuned with extra concentration on 1975-2005 as what to hindcast correctly, using factors that exclude natural cycles such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and a likely loosely-linked Pacific item that shows up in multi-year-smoothed ENSO indexes and the versions of PDO index that have better correlation with multi-year-smoothed ENSO. That’s not the big problem though. That’s fluffing around the edges of the big problem which is that they need to be tuned at all. If the results dont emerge from GCMs without having to be tuned to best suit the time we’ve been observing then there is no reason to suspect they’ll do any good for the time’s we’ve yet to observe because the system that is the climate is going to change…but not necessarily in ways we expect or have seen. You found the end of the temperature rise driven by the modern maximum in solar activity that ended in 2003-4, according to my solar calculations. The cause of the pause was the cause before the pause. The sun. There ia no real evidence that the radiant greenhouse effect that the AGW conjecture depends upon even exists.  As derived from first principals, the surface of the Earth is 33 degrees C warmer because of the atmopshere because of the heat capacity of the atmosphere, the depth of the troposphere, and gravity.  These elements in effect form a convective greenhouse effect and are not a function of the LWIR absorption properties of some of the trace gases in the atmosphere.  33 degrees C is what has been calculated and 33 degrees is what has been measured.  There is no additional warming caused by a radiant greenhouse effect.  A radiant greenhouse effect has not been observed anywhere in the solar system.  The radiant greenhouse effect is nothing but science fiction as is the AGW conjecture.  If CO2 really affected climate then the increase in CO2 over the past 30 years should have caused at least a measureable increase in the dry lapse rate in the troposphere but such has not happened.  The lack of a hot spot is just another example of the non-existance of the radiant greenhouse effect. Yes indeed, wilhas.  that is the simple truth.  No ‘ghgs’ (unlikely) would have needed atmospheric bleed-off to equilibrate T.  That would mean no atmosphere left to speak of.  But no matter, because life would never even start without various molecules including some ‘ghgs’. The equivalent radiating altitude is set at the mass altitude centroid of the atmosphere and has nothing to do with the LWIR absorption properties of some trace gases.  In the IPCC’s first report, they published a wide range of guesses at the climate sensivity of CO2.  In their last report, the IPCC published the exact same wide range of guesses.  So after more than two decades of effort, the IPCC has learned nothing that would allow them to decrease the range of their guesses one iota.  If they were able to observe how changes in CO2 affected the effective radiating altitude then they would have been able to at least narrow the range of their guesses but such has not happened. 33 degrees C is what has been calculated and 33 degrees is what has been measured. The convective greenhouse effect has been observed on all planets in the solar system with thick atmospheres.  The moon does not have a thick atmosphere so the convective greenhouse effect does not apply. Another very simple prediction is that the atmosphere will expand – and as a result the pressure levels will rise. Instead the only evidence I’ve seen suggests the reverse for the troposphere as a whole. That means on average there’s been more cooling of the troposphere than warming. Small correction. The pressure doesn’t rise when the atmosphere expands due to heating. It remains exactly the same. It expands because of thermal expansion, not because there is more of it. The levels at which a particular pressure is experienced will rise. Crispin, I think Scottish Sceptic is already correct about this and needs no further correction.  According to the kinetic theory of gases, atmospheric pressure at the surface does rise due to heating because the air-molecules move faster at higher temperatures and therefore possess more kinetic energy and momentum.  It is precisely their greater energy and momentum that causes them to rise to greater heights above the surface, which manifests as the thermal expansion of the atmosphere. Is this is a religion? Just asking because this looks like an nth thread hijack attempt. The lapse rate and convection set the altitude of the tropopause and the thickness of the troposphere as a function of the temperatures of the surface and of the atmosphere at the altitude where the tropopause happens to be.  The surface and the atmosphere at the altitude of the tropopause have their temperatures adjusting themselves to have heat outgo of each matching heat income of each.  Most of the heat outgo and heat income of each of these is by radiation. Without greenhouse gases, the surface and tropopause temperatures would be close together, and the lapse rate and convection would make the tropopause very low in altitude and the troposphere very thin.  Convection would be minimal, existing only by being forced by the equator being warmer than the poles.  With uniform surface temperature and no greenhouse gases, the atmosphere would have uniform temperature matching that of the surface (due to heat conduction), the altitude of the tropopause would be vanishingly low, and there would be no troposphere and no convection. The altitude of the tropopause depends on pressure and has nothing to do with the LWIR absorption properties of a few trace gases.  Such has been observed on all planets in the solar system with thick atmospheres. Willhas:  Are you calling water vapor a trace gas?  Meanwhile, the absorption spectrum of Earth’s atmosphere at wavelengths where it matters for Earth and atmosphere temperature thermal radiation is due to gases and vapors whose molecules have at least 3 atoms. Those who deny that increase of CO2 can’t do anything on basis of its spectral properties or on how little CO2 there is don’t even have their stories straight as to whether its insignificant due to being a trace gas or due to there being so much of it that its spectral effects are already saturated. As for other examples of a “trace gas” being significant:  In a low pressure sodium lamp, sodium is about .15-.2 % of the gas/vapor composition and accounts for over 99% of its spectrum.  In fluorescent lamps, mercury vapor is about .2-.3 % (that high only when the lamp is warmed up) of the gas/vapor mixture and accounts for about 99% of the spectrum of the radiation from the gas/vapor mixture. Donald L. Klipstein  April 3, 2017 at 8:48 am interesting. IR active gases are screens, not blankets, though. Okay, what effect should IR active gases have on the temperature profile, given the kinetic theory of gases. Under that theory, hot gas moves faster than cold gas. Well, we know what one IR active chemical does do, when liquid or solid, and that effect is lowering the lapse rate from about -9K/km to about -6.5K/km. So, wouldn’t IR active gases do the same thing, even if the bulk of water’s effect is from conversion of potential energy in the form of the latent heat of fusion and deposition to kinetic energy? If CO2 had the effect posited, shouldn’t we see its effect on the lapse rate? The lapse rate is a measure of the insulation properties of the atmosphere.  It turns out that the lapse rate is a function of the heat capacity of the atmosphere and the pressure gardient and has nothing to do with the LWIR absorption properties of some trace gasses.  Actually adding CO2 to the atmosphere will lower the lapse rate which is a cooling effect.  There is no evidence that the increase in CO2 over the past 30 years has had any effect on the lapse rate in the troposphere. That’s my point. If the IR based premise that there should be a tropical tropospheric hotspot was measurable, then we should be able to see that effect on the moist and dry atmosphere’s lapse rate. Since we can’t detect it yet, if it is there, yet we can and do detect water’s effect, would that not show defects in the IR dominated radiative model? I take it that you agree with me that the posited IR effects of carbon dioxide are too small to be resolved against the background. I don’t agree with the ‘insulation’ bits, but do agree that the lapse rate (change in temperature in the atmosphere as a function of height above the surface) is set by the atmosphere’s mass, the planetary gravitational field and the whole atmosphere’s composition, which determines the heat capacity, which changes, variably, on a regional basis as a result of regional chemical processes. cdquarles:  As you said, water vapor lowers the lapse rate due to latent heat of fusion.  More accurately, this effect is mostly from latent heat of vaporization.  This explains the difference between the dry and wet adiabatic lapse rates.  It has nothing to do with water being IR-active.  Warm air with over 1% or 2% water vapor but with relative humidity less than 100% has its adiabatic lapse rate being high due to the dry one being applicable, and cooler air with relative humidity at 100% and clouds present with .5% or .2% water vapor (even including if its cloud droplets were vaporized) would have a lower adiabatic lapse rate due to the wet one being applicable. Greenhouse gases due to their IR effect cool the stratosphere and warm the surface, giving rise to convection.  Water is different in having also a surface-cooling effect due to it having latent heat of vaporization, but its surface-cooling effect from evaporative cooling is less than its surface-warming effect by being the main greenhouse gas. Without greenhouse gases, the surface temperature would match the temperature of the lower stratosphere, and there would be little or no troposphere in between.  But if there should be one due to convection forced by horizontal temperature gradients, it would be thin and have a lapse rate being the dry adiabatic lapse rate of 9 degrees C per km. willhaas April 4, 2017 at 1:01 pm:  The surface and lower troposphere have gotten warmer and the lower stratosphere have gotten cooler since satellites started measuring the temperature of various levels in 1979.  Check out even what Christy and Spencer say about this.  This means that the lapse rate is increasing or the troposphere is getting thicker or both.  I think mostly the troposphere getting thicker.  To increase the worldwide temperature difference between the surface and the lower stratosphere by 1 degree C only requires raising the tropopause by about 150 meters worldwide.  Its altitude varies from under 8 km to around 20 km depending on where in the world and the season, so a 150 meter rise is something that has to be searched for throughout all the radiosonde soundings, which don’t even cover a majority of the world. “Climate” by very definition is REGIONAL. There is no more a ‘global climate’ that here is a global language or a global currency. The term ‘climate’ is bandied around incessantly when people actually are talking about temperature, or to be more precise enthalpy. How do you know if something is changing if you have no metric to measure it? In the case of a regional parameter, that metric is a classification. Global warming morphed into climate change when it was obvious there is no such thing. Climate change is morphing not ‘extreme weather’ becasue few if any actual climates exhibit significant change. Climates classified by the Trewartha system are greening; an obvious change for the better. That is why the even more obscure and meaningless term ‘extreme weather’ is becoming popular. The movement of energy from surface to 32 km (includes 99% of molecules) is resisted by four parallel thermal resistors: latent evap/cond, conduction, convection, radiation. The inverse of the combined resistance is U, the composite thermal conductivity of the atmosphere. The flow from surface to 32 km is  described by: Q, Btu/h = U * A * dT. About as simple an explanation as needed to fit the observations. Above 32km there are no molecules worth mention, no latent, cond or convection, all radiation and S-B applies. ISR, Btu/h incoming across discular cross section = U A dT, Btu/h outward through spherical atmosphere. This creates the warm surface same way it creates a warm house. It’s fundamental HVAC. All this up/down/”back” LWIR is just rubbish. No kidding, that is what they did. They messed up good data until there was no chance of being able to see whether or not there was a hot spot in it, and declared the lousy data to be just that (which by then it was). They next expressed confidence that the hot spot was probably there somewhere. This idea and process was created and monitored by the authors of AR5. I don’t think AR5 contains manipulated junk science, I know it does. Thanks Neil for recovering that comment. The AR5 expert reviewer who monitored the section dealing with the cover-up of the absence of the hotspot maintains this story line is correct. The data is good, the satellites confirm it, the hotspot is not there, the data were messed with, the result was garbagy data, the data was declared (by a different group) to be of such poor quality that the hot spot could not be detected. So they declared that the GHG radiative feedback theory was good and the hotspot is probably there. Geronimo, suggest you refrain from drawing attention to that paper. It is misleading and the information necessary to place the topic in context is not generally available to those who are not regular readers of WUWT. It is, quite simply, a scientific scandal. Further, the predicted behaviour of the GHG hotspot is that it will be warming 3 times faster than the surface. This poses a problem. The surface in the tropics doesn’t warm much at all from changes in the GHG concentrations. Why then should there be a tropical hotspot? Bit if a theoretical oversight, eh? If the hotspot is not there where is the warming taking place, then where is the warming coming from, and is it because of GHG’s at all? Maybe heat is carried to the poles in warm water. But that only works for the North Pole region. There has been no continental warming in Antarctica in 60 years. In climate science, an enhanced greenhouse effect due to CO2 is widely accepted as fact despite the fact that no measurement of a CO2 signature has risen above the Detection Limit Threshold. and the more you need to spend to stop it happening. You’ve just described homeopathy. Yes! Thank you very much, for I’ve seen variations on this theme before and not just analytical chemistry. Similar concepts apply, in particular, in medical practice. That said, given other evidence about the sample, one could make a case that the dioxin we can’t detect is indeed there and we will detect it when we improve the accuracy, precision and resolution of our instruments sufficiently that we get the S/N above the detection limit. My suggestion is that we spend $billions on research into the effects of living in a warmer clinate. I’m already living in the tropics having migrated from the (very cold)  UK. I therefore deem myself eligible for $10m in grant money. I’ll email the results of my research to anyone funding me. Sometimes the considered opinion is that no one really knows, and all the theories to explain variations in climate are inadequate. Having followed this blog for a while, that is the only conclusion I can reach. Dear Tom, I almost share the exact same opinion with one difference. I regard the theory of chaotic climate as being probably correct, but completely useless for predictive purposes. The hearings are steps along the way, at last.  Claims were being noted, and other papers and data entered for the record.  It is a snowball. and growing as planned. It means that the warming did not occur as they predicted – it is consistent with near surface warming and not total troposphere warming. http://english.iap.cas.cn/RE/201510/t20151022_153743.html Or one could say both are suspect, for some of the overconfident statements are made using premises for which the validity has not yet been established. Shine a strong light on a gas in a bottle in a lab, when you get sufficient absorption within the bottle (don’t forget the bottle), one will expect and find a local temperature change of said gas. Gases in the free atmosphere are far less constrained than said bottled gas. So, one should not draw vast conclusions yet. One’s data may be half-vast, so to speak. No need to obfuscate this. If a model predicts a hot spot and a valid test demonstrate that hot spot isn´t there -there must be something wrong with the model. Further, It is not a logically valid assumption to assume that the average of a handful of flawed models will produce a valid result. Could be the Svensmark theory is what has kept an AGW Earth from turning into Venus. While I doubt that, its obvious that Earth is perfectly capable of cooling itself. The field of certain sciences is a patchwork of theories created to support dogma. When a theory can’t explain observations in astrophysics, more theories are created to explain the phenomenon, theories that are not linked to the original theory in mechanism, in any way shape or form. Solar theory is exactly this. Similarly, the hotspot failed to materialise so “homogenisation” is the excuse to retain the fallacy of dogmatic belief. German garden gnome. That gnome may well be German, but could also be hiding the tropical hot spot in the arctic. He’s got something to do with AGW. You can tell by the smug look on his face. I’ve seen that look on my wife’s face many times. Right before she farts. Global average temperature anomaly has local, regional, national and global components in which global warming refer to global component.  The local, regional and national components primarily driven by the climate system and general circulation and thus have little role to play at global scale. The second issue is solar radiation — the observed global solar and net radiation clearly indicate 11 year cycle and its multiples.  So, they play vital role on the ground. Dr. S. Jeevananda Reddy We could simply wait 50 years and see if global temperatures go crazy, but it would be nice to know whether the theory is correct before we all cook. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-13/germanys-schaeuble-warns-europe-needs-more-refugees-prevent-inbreeding Fascist as fascist can; rassist as rassist can: against his own people. Volksverräter. …Does the absence of a tropospheric equatorial hotspot mean anthropogenic climate models are unequivocally wrong? – The answer is no. There are plenty of examples of scientific theories which were slightly wrong, which didn’t fully explain observations, which were later found to be mostly right. Newtonian gravity mostly explains the orbit of the planets, but some observations don’t match the theory. For example, Newtonian predictions of the orbit of Mercury do not match observations. Mercury is very close to the sun, much closer than the Earth. That close to a massive body like the Sun, Einstein’s General Relativity becomes important. Relativistic effects cause Mercury’s orbit to diverge from Newtonian predictions of what its orbit should be. This deviation from theoretical predictions does not mean Newtonian theory is broken, in this case it simply means the Newtonian theory is incomplete…. Now, that is NOT how I learnt Science. If a prediction is found to be wrong, that hypothesis is NOT valid. Period.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6-x0modwY Newton’s Laws, for instance, are wrong. The theory IS broken.  It is a close approximation, and still useful for a lot of purposes, but it is not ‘incomplete’ – it is wrong. Now, if you make a prediction from a hypothesis which turns out to be wrong, there are al sorts of excuses you can make. Maybe the prediction wasn’t quite justified. Maybe your observations were wrong. Maybe some other phenomenon gets in the way and renders your logic faulty. But, if you have investigated all these, and as far as you can tell they do not apply, then you don’t have a ‘mostly right’ hypothesis. You have a wrong one… No, no they don’t.  They simply approximate the solution.  Newton’s theories are wrong.  However, they may apply in certain specific instances using CORRECT assumptions, in order to achieve approximations of the real results. Students of the philosophy and history of science debate whether Newton’s theory and model of universal gravitation were wrong or simply limited in application, ie to low-speed and low-gravitational field environments. I argue that he was in fact wrong, because he didn’t understand how gravity actually works.  He though that gravitational force was instantaneous, so worked at any distance essentially instantaneously.  Einstein showed that this assumption is incorrect.  Nothing, not even gravity, can travel faster than light, with a few highly unusual exceptions. Maybe in future physics will discover that Newton was right and that gravity, whatever it is, does indeed work at any distance instantly, but so far Einstein seems to have produced the superior model. The simple fact is that whenever you look at the climate record, we find things like “the little ice age only occurred in Europe” or “The Arctic is melting” – i.e. regional warming inconsistent with with GLOBAL CO2, or “the atmosphere is not warming height wise as per CO2”. Likewise, if we look at temperature records we find the land warming faster than sea from 1970-2000 and likewise the northern hemisphere more than the south – again inconsistent with GLOBAL CO2 warming. Indeed, even when they try to scare the pants of the public, it’s always a REGIONAL drought, flood, etc. again inconsistent with GLOBAL CO2 warming. And the more I look at the record, the more I release that everything the alarmists cite as “evidence” for their cult, actually is evidence against – because the only evidence for their cult is slow long-term GLOBAL WARMING. And virtually everything they quote is fast, regional, or in the wrong bit of the atmosphere and is actually evidence AGAINST. In contrast almost everything we see is compatible with warming caused by the reduction in cooling causing pollution in the Northern hemisphere, on land from the 1970s- ending roughly 2000 (with the pause), in the lowest Troposphere and not in the tropics which explains the lack of the equatorial hotspot. “Speaking of idiotic, no, that is not what I am saying. In fact, it is folks in the poorer regions who are asking for assistance from wealthier countries whose CO2 emissions are going to impact the climate in their countries.” No it’s not, the rest of the world doesn’t care about Climate Change. http://data.myworld2015.org The effect of a drop on a stone is insignificant. The effect of a drop after drop falling on a stone for a period of many years can make a hole in the stone. You cannot conclude that because you barely see the effect of a solar cycle minimum on the climate the effect of a 50-100 year grand solar minimum should be equally negligible. Specially when there is abundant evidence that it is not. And if you have the continuous effect of a cluster of grand solar minima for 400 years, the climate might take another 400 years to recover. Again there is evidence that some of the changes that took place during the Little Ice Age, like the contraction of the Hadley cells, are still being reverted. https://www.google.at/search?q=es+gibt+keine+Alternative+merkel+raute&oq=es+gibt+keine+Alternative+merkel+raute&aqs=chrome. The hotspot hypothesis is flawed because convection is more powerful than insulation from carbonic anhydride. Guys look Russell’s teapot. Some smudgy fingerprints on the edges – tropical hotspot perhaps? https://www.flickr.com/photos/24792080@N05/4423797925 The BBC Radio 4 is carrying a news feed on scientific knowledge/research. It states: Every day the newspapers carry stories of new scientific findings. There are 15 million scientists worldwide all trying to get their research published. But a disturbing fact appears if you look closely: as time goes by, many scientific findings seem to become less true than we thought. It’s called the “decline effect” – and some findings even dwindle away to zero. A highly influential paper by Dr John Ioannidis at Stanford University called “Why most published research findings are false” argues that fewer than half of scientific papers can be believed, and that the hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true. He even showed that of the 49 most highly cited medical papers, only 34 had been retested and of them 41 per cent had been convincingly shown to be wrong. And yet they were still being cited. Again and again, researchers are finding the same things, whether it’s with observational studies, or even the “gold standard” Randomised Controlled Studies, whether it’s medicine or economics. Nobody bothers to try to replicate most studies, and when they do try, the majority of findings don’t stack up. The awkward truth is that, taken as a whole, the scientific literature is full of falsehoods. Jolyon Jenkins reports on the factors that lie behind this. How researchers who are obliged for career reasons to produce studies that have “impact”; of small teams who produce headline-grabbing studies that are too statistically underpowered to produce meaningful results; of the way that scientists are under pressure to spin their findings and pretend that things they discovered by chance are what they were looking for in the first place. It’s not exactly fraud, but it’s not completely honest either. And he reports on new initiatives to go through the literature systematically trying to reproduce published findings, and of the bitter and personalised battles that can occur as a result. This  “decline effect” has been well known for years. It is sometimes referred to as the half life of facts. According to the half life of facts half of everything that you consider are facts, will every 10 years be found not to be facts. Of course since this article is being run on the BBC (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f9r4k) there is no mention of the effect of this on Climate Science, and whether we the public/listener should be sceptical to placing too much reliance on IPCC reports, and/or other Climate Science papers.  The observation the hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true. appears to be very apt to Climate Science, which is pervaded by Group Think and a priori bias. “It’s not exactly fraud”- He hasn’t exactly encountered Michael Mann. Yes, your comment with respect to Climate Science is very apt. My research proves that everything that you thought you knew with respect to Climate due to Greenhouse gasses is wrong. Google “Climate Change Deciphered for the facts. . The atmosphere is thicker, reaches higher into space over the equator than the poles, due to centrifugal force of the Earth’s spin. Centrifugal force is greater at the equator than the poles, so air, including CO2, tends to pile up higher into space over the equator. This is serious nonsense. With the same MASS of the air column, the surface pressure at the poles will be ~5 hPa higher than at the equator due to the small difference in effective gravity caused by the centrifugal force.. This tiny difference was evened out at the time the atmosphere developed, a couple of billion years ago. “All three of the theories proposed above can potentially explain the primary observation – the world is warming, and heating is more pronounced in polar regions.” Not quite.  Antarctica has not warmed at all.  Not a whit.  Another hole in the theory. Our current Quaternary ice age began 2,588,000 years ago and continues today, making it the world’s most recent period of glaciations. Our Quaternary ice age encompasses  a series of cold periods (glacials) and warmer periods (interglacials). Within glacials there are warm periods and during interglacials cold periods.  Our current global warm period may be one of these warm periods in our interglacial period. Observations of Pleistocene shoreline features on the tectonically stable islands of Bermuda and the Bahamas have suggested that sea level during (MIS11) about 400,000 years ago was between 32 and 65 feet higher than it is today. This suggests that both the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during the protracted warm period while changes in the volume of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet were relatively minor. The last interglacial period, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, was characterized by global mean surface temperatures that were at least 2\xa0°C warmer than present. Mean sea level stood 13-20 feet higher than modern sea level, with an important contribution from a reduction of the Greenland ice sheet. Although some fossil reef data indicate sea-level fluctuations of up to 33 feet around the mean, so far it has not been possible to constrain the duration and rates of change of these shorter-term variations. What does this mean?  it shows that you are going to have sea level rise no mater what you do if you do not start a new glaciation. Bond events are North Atlantic ice rafting events that are tentatively linked to climate fluctuations in the Holocene. Eight such events have been identified. Bond events the primary period of variability is now put at ~1,000 years. List of last four Bond Events and the names of the intervening warm periods.  i would not that the warm periods coincide with the growth of civilization and the Bond events coincide with death and the retreat of civilization. There may be a tiny tropical hotspot that indicates a tiny role for CO2, but I think the problem is the overestimate of the role of radiation in the atmosphere.   Texas Instruments publish a note on heat sink design that suggests that only if painted black can radiation account for 25% of cooling without forced airflow.   It also suggests that forced airflow can increase cooling by a factor of 10.   All of this is common sense. Of course radiation is the overwhelmingly major, if not the only, way energy leaves the Earth but as I understand it very little radiation from CO2 is seen from space.   This suggests to me that, being vastly outnumbered by other molecules that surround it, much of CO2’s absorbed energy is passed to its near neighbours. A final point is that the so-called “enhanced greenhouse effect” is fundamentally a feedback loop only between temperature and water vapour.   Above a critical global temperature, in which CO2 plays a vital role, whatever causes an increase in temperature will permit more water vapour to be held by the atmosphere, which in turn absorb more long wave radiation and raises the temperature further. In the 60’s, in the absence of convection, clouds and the water cycle, it was shown that the water vapour positive feedback loop would result in a steady state surface temperature, of up to 80 deg C.   That is nearer 15 deg C on average, suggests to me that CO2 is not the danger that some believe.   As has been discussed here and elsewhere there is growing evidence that low CO2 permits ice ages and presents the real threat to human life through the dramatic reduction of photosynthesis. The “tropical hotspot” is a negative feedback in global warming caused by convection and water vapor feedback, which I’m sure all “deniers” like me believe would happen. for clarification.   Since radiation LEAVING the atmosphere must ultimately equal radiation ENTERING the atmosphere if everything is in balance,  rather than straight lines, that negative lapse rate feedback must ultimately curve in to meet the original  lapse rate output. I did consult the experts. /sarc https://www.skepticalscience.com/tropospheric-hot-spot.htm The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are the real experts on the tropispheric ‘hotspot’. i refer you to my above post at here for summation, explanation, quotation from, and link to what the IPCC says. If I understand this issue correctly, the missing hot spot is important because it speaks to the heat transport across the atmosphere directly, quite independent from the variations of surface temperature. Too much attention has been paid, by both sides, to the question whether or not there is a pause, or which temperature record is best etc. It is clear that temperatures vary spontaneously, and staring at them won’t let us tell apart natural and man-mad variation. The real test of the CO2 hypothesis is in observing the heat transport properties of the atmosphere. These changes should be observable regardless of natural temperature variation, pauses, El-Ninos etc. This is where the hot spot comes in. Its being AWOL is the most direct and solid proof that the CAGW hypothesis is wrong. It is in Man’s nature to dislike “not knowing” and to deny the existence of unknowables. this is particularly manifest in those who are dimwitted or whose egos cannot accept any notion of lack of expertise. The crime takes place when some of these individuals combine their lack of humility with an opportunity to take the spotlight on themselves. Al Gore ring a bell? Michael Mann? It’s a long list. Mediocrity masquerading as Saviour! John Worrall, I, for one, would be much more receptive to your article if, in the following, as extracted from your article, you would use the word “hypotheses” instead of “theories”. After all, I believe, as do many others, that scientifically speaking, practically all of our notions regarding the “cause of that warming” are just that: notions, which remain unproven at this time. [Yes, below I added the capitalization.] Therefore, certainly, as such, these notions are neither “laws”; nor are they “theories”; rather, they are hypotheses … which may or may not be true. All three of the THEORIES proposed above can potentially explain the primary observation – the world is warming, and heating is more pronounced in polar regions.” But nobody has yet managed to unequivocally detect that predicted hotspot.  Various theories have been advanced to explain the missing hotspot. … the jump from ‘unequivocal detection’ to conclusively ‘missing’ seems a little rash. You say “More research is required”. I agree, for worthwhile pursuits like “medical research”. As for climate, we will adapt, as we always have. Troposphere temperature is controlled by the Sun. Solar EUV makes Ozone in the Ozone layer. The Sun is quiet now, so less Ozone [half-life of about a year] lower temperature. We will watch the Planet cool as this Solar minimum progress. Well a) it’s more than likely that any hot air is quickly redistributed by wind and b) Dr Nir Shaviv is a hell of a lot more convincing about solar influences than Willis as you can read for yourself at his own blog here; http://www.sciencebits.com/reply-eschenbach >The hotspot prediction is easy to understand… CO2, tends to pile up higher into space over the equator. Well, it is not that easy to understand. It is not that CO2 tends to pile up, but that water vapor tends to pile up. It is the water vapor according to CAGW theory that will cause the hotspot. CO2 has only a minor contribution. According to CAGW theory, any warming from whatever cause will cause more water vapor in the air. This increase in (absolute) water vapor will provide a positive feedback. Further, this increase in water vapor will not result in more clouds or alternatively, increases in clouds will be of the type that helps to trap escaping heat from earth. Note: even if gnomes (ocean currents, solar, whatever) are causing warming, the water vapor theory which is part of CAGW theory would predict a Tropical Upper Tropospheric hotspot. The missing hotspot doesn’t falsify AGW, but it falsifies CAGW (catastrophic anthropogenic global warming). It takes the “C” out. http://www.iflscience.com/environment/climate-meme-debunked-tropospheric-hot-spot-found/ The question is not “if they found it.” This is a quantitative issue: is the hot spot as strong as predicted by the models? Christy’s point is that it is not. Those are simply artifacts of homogenizing “data”, without any physical reality.  Without statistical and graphical “tricks”, there could be no consensus “climate (anti-)science”. My understanding is that the tropical tropospheric hot spot is predicted because global warming is expected to increase absolute humidity, which decreases the lapse rate, which makes the mid-troposphere warmer relative to the ground than it otherwise would be (and makes the ground a bit warmer, too). Hence the predicted “hot spot” in the troposphere. I thought pretty much everyone (except Dan Miller) agreed on that. We live in such a partisan world in politics and politicized global science agendas that fact checking even key points and claims behind the policy inertia is ignored. Hello? On the last round the world flight of Concorde it traversed the Pacific. Although the distances between airports are larger with nothing in between but open ocean Concorde was able to cover these distances because the atmosphere at altitude over the equator is colder than northern latitudes and cold air is better for engine and wing efficiency. There was no mention at all of warm air or hot spots: The key conversation is around 12:00 “For example, Newtonian predictions of the orbit of Mercury do not match observations. ” It’s even worse than that.,  I didn’t realize until recently (became curious after Liu’s book) that all the orbits are in reality essentially unsolvable n-body problems.  We can only calculate the orbits by making certain assumptions (planar relationships, ignore certain masses) that are not absolutely true but don’t change the answers enough to matter for anything we’re doing. To warm the surface, all it needs to do is be warmer than whatever is behind the hot spot.  Any net increase in incoming radiation will cause a warming. Well, no, thanks, but it doesn’t, because it’s not really credible. First, there’s no real evidence that radiation carries energy (i.e., “photons”). If it did, there would be a problem, as energy is mass-equivalent, and radiation, which we know to be massless, travels at the speed of light, so if energy traveled with radiation, it would become infinite, which is of course not the case. Furthermore, energy can only be detected by material sensors, which have mass, therefore there’s no mass-independent way of detecting energy in radiation. It’s far more likely that electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is simply an energyless frequency field, and that energy is generated when that field strikes matter. This doesn’t violate the first law of thermodynamics, BTW, because that law applies only to thermally isolated systems, which Earth and Sun are clearly not. This has the benefit of defining energy as an inseparable property of matter, reflective of its acceleration, in rotations, vibrations, transitions, and ionizations, rather than having a whole different kind of energy associated with radiation. This is consistent with the fact that all energy terms contain a mass term, or are expressible in dimensions that contain a mass term without multiplication by a dimensional conversion factor. This also renders unnecessary the distinction between photons and heat that you refer to. Heat is simply the acceleration of charged particles of matter responding resonantly to an incident EMR frequency field. Now, as to atmospheric “heat” raising Earth’s surface temperature, no; as there are no “photons” back-radiated by CO2 in the atmosphere, just EMR of certain infrared frequencies, that EMR must have frequencies equal to or greater than those of the matter of Earth’s surface in order to induce resonant accelerations in such matter. As back-radiation, the original radiation must have come from Earth itself, so the back-radiation can’t have a higher frequency than that which is absorbed by the CO2 above it. Finally, it’s obvious that an object, such as Earth, or an apple, can’t heat itself with its own radiation, because if it could, then material objects would spontaneously heat up until they would vaporize in a puff of smoke! Thankfully, this doesn’t happen. Microwave ovens, BTW, work on the principle of synchrotron radiation, which is a whole different thing. “The blanket can warm you, but only to the level of your own body heat of 98.6 oF” That would only be true if you were dead.  Since you’re not, you’re constantly producing about 100W of energy. If you are perfectly insulated your temperature will continue to rise until you die, here in the real world you will reach a new equilibrium somewhere warmer than you currently are. “The blanket can warm you, but only to the level of your own body heat of 98.6 oF” The only reason why this is true is because the body is self regulating, when it takes less energy to maintain 98.6, the body starts using less energy. Try the same thing with a light bulb that produces pretty much the same amount of energy regardless of the temperature of it’s environment.  In that situation you will find out that the more insulation you put around the light bulb, the hotter the light bulb gets. PS: Retarding the rate at which energy leaves, is the same thing as warming. Wo-wo! No way! Consider you under a non-electric blanket. The blanket can warm you, but only to the level of your own body heat of 98.6 oF. If you want to be warmer than that, you have to use an electric blanket. Ergo, back-radiation of heat can’t warm a surface to a temperature higher than that of the surface. To do that, an additional source of heat input is required. According to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, an object (i.e., Earth’s surface) can’t be warmed by another object (i.e., the troposphere) that’s cooler than itself. No. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says Second Law of Thermodynamics: In any cyclic process the entropy will either increase or remain the same. Entropy: a state variable whose change is defined for a reversible process at T where Q is the heat absorbed. Entropy: a measure of the amount of energy which is unavailable to do work. I suspect your problem is that you are confusing thermal radiation with heat.  Radiation consists of photons that are not heat but may be converted to heat energy if absorbed by a substance. Some of the thermal radiation from the upper troposphere reaches the Earth’s surface (directly or indirectly) and is absorbed by the surface where it is converted to heat so it raises the surface’s temperature. Please think of a microwave oven where its radiative emitters provide radiation which is absorbed by the food to be cooked so the food warms to much higher temperatures than the emitters:  similarly, radiation re-emitted from the atmosphere heats the Earth’s surface. I hope this explanation helps. Crikey!  That needs moderation!?  I cannot imagine why. Richard, I suspect it is your name that triggers moderation, not the text of your comment. Consider it a mark of distinction 😉 Good to see you back on here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavity_magnetron Ironically, a German, active in WWII radar development, had been granted the patent on the cavity magnetron in 1938.

For some reason, my lengthy reply to your comment posted three comments above. Sorry for that! I suggest that you try to publish your complete revision of radiative physics in the formal literature so it has a chance of gaining traction. I admit that your ideas fail to convince me because the existing theories of radiation have practical applications that are used.  However, if you think your ideas have merit then it can be argued that you have a duty to advance them. I add that I have some experience in these matters.  I believe I am the only individual who has produced his own system (hardware and software) for quantitative energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (QEDX) and I know I am the only person in Europe to have done this.  (I consider my algorith is still the best that has been developed for the ZAF correction required by the Au layer on the detector crystal.)  The wavelenghts differ but the fundamental physics are the same for QEDX and the atmospheric greenhouse effect. richardscourtney:Thanks. I’m leery of the “formal [i.e., peer-reviewed] literature,” because of its conservative nature and its tendency to discourage innovation in science. This is especially true in this case, since I’m making arguments that are contrary to Albert Einstein and to QED, which are well-established, and any reviewers qualified to pass judgment on my arguments are certainly well-funded and career-dependent upon the correctness of accepted theories. Therefore, I’ve chosen instead to enlighten posterity (ha-ha) with my ideas in a book “The Real World, a Synthesis” (https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Synthesis-Featuring-Critical-ebook/dp/B01ERXVQ8K or https://www.amazon.com/World-Synthesis-David-Bennett-Laing/dp/1520440197/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). That said, I do try to keep an open mind, and if you have “practical applications” that are inconsistent with my conclusions, I’d be grateful if you could send them along. My address is davidlaing@aol.com. Tx! Now this dub-thread is effectively over I am responding to your off-topic comment because the matter is both amusing and interesting. Propaganda concerning adoption of centimetric radar by the RAF in WW2 induced the urban myth that eating carrots improves ability to see in the dark.  This explanation of the myth’s origin includes During the 1940 Blitzkrieg, the Luftwaffe often struck under the cover of darkness. In order to make it more difficult for the German planes to hit targets, the British government issued citywide blackouts. The Royal Air Force were able to repel the German fighters in part because of the development of a new, secret radar technology. The on-board Airborne Interception Radar (AI), first used by the RAF in 1939, had the ability to pinpoint enemy bombers before they reached the English Channel. But to keep that under wraps, according to Stolarczyk’s research pulled from the files of the Imperial War Museum, the Mass Observation Archive, and the UK National Archives, the Ministry provided another reason for their success: carrots. In 1940, RAF night fighter ace, John Cunningham, nicknamed “Cat’s Eyes”, was the first to shoot down an enemy plane using AI. He’d later rack up an impressive total of 20 kills—19 of which were at night. According to “Now I Know” writer Dan Lewis, also a Smithsonian.com contributor, the Ministry told newspapers that the reason for their success was because pilots like Cunningham ate an excess of carrots. You don’t need to go further than radiative physics to explain the hotspot prediction. The enhanced greenhouse effect postulates an increase in IR photons arriving at the surface. This is sometimes described as “blocking” or absorption and re-radiation of OLR due to accumulation of CO2 or other greenhouse gases as the increase comes from within the atmosphere. The detailed arguments of feedbacks and others don’t really add anything significant to this basic point. Regardless of the detail, more IR photons coming from a mass is an indicator that the mass has increased in temperature. This is a principle of the operation of some temperature measuring instruments, We can conclude that the enhanced greenhouse prediction of more IR arriving at the surface must be due to increased temperature aloft.  This is a testable prediction, but it can be refined. The inverse-square law can be simplified by recognising that mass within the atmosphere radiates upwards and downwards.  The surface layer can be characterised by upward-only radiative flux. For a given increase in temperature at the surface layer due to radiative flux from within the atmosphere, there must be a larger increase in temperature aloft compared to the surface. This refines the prediction. There is some additional (minor) detail about geometry and why the maximum effect is above the equator.  But the conclusion is reached: the predicted hotspot pattern (or even just the main features of the pattern) gives us a test for the enhanced greenhouse effect. Today, there is no confirmation of this pattern. In the days of pre-post-normal science, we may have called this “falsification by data”. The signal-to-noise argument is an acknowledgement that there is no evidence to support the enhanced greenhouse effect. ‘Most of the warming has occurred in Earth’s coldest air masses, at night, during winter.’ David, this is largely an artifact of using minimum temperature as a proxy for night time temperatures. What has happened is reduced lowlevel clouds, mostly from reduced aerosols has resulted in more early morning sunlight reaching the surface causing earlier and higher minimum temperatures, especially at higher latitudes in winter. when there is a longer period od low incidence sunlight. And note the prediction that higher minimum temperatures will be correlated with earlier minimum temperatures. “But nobody has yet managed to unequivocally detect that predicted hotspot.” IMO, one of the most important pieces of the “global warming” aka “climate change” aka “climate disruption” debate … the missing ‘Hot-Spot’. https://climatism.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-missing-hot-spot/ “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.” – Albert Einstein “Walk toward the fire.

He was initially drafted by the St. Louis Hawks as the 1st Round 2nd overall pick at the 1956 NBA draft. Bill Russell achieved a total of 11 NBA championship titles in his pro basketball career while playing as a Center. He achieved the NBA Championship title 11 times in 1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969 while playing for the NBA franchise Boston Celtics. The individual players of a winning team are presented with a ring, as a sign of honour for leading the team to its victory. Sometimes, these players are also presented other commemorative items such as a wrist watch, in place of the ring. But the greatest honour these players receive is the love and respect from the people around the world. The National Basketball Association, or NBA as we normally know it, it is one of the most viewed sport leagues in the world and the main event of professional basketball worldwide. The NBA seasons spans from October to June, in the meantime, 30 teams play each other to be crowned as the Champions. Competitive teams are made through drafts and trades. A good trade can become the key of a champion team or a dynasty. Here it is our list of the 10 greatest trades in NBA history. Arguably the best foreign player in NBA history, German power forward Nowitzki has played his entire 17-season career with the Dallas Mavericks. As a member of the Mavs, he has played 13 All Star Games; he won the MVP award in 2007 and the NBA Finals MVP award in 2011. To this point, he has scored 28,119 points with 3,282 assists and 10,051 rebounds and he is undoubtedly the franchise player of his team. That is why we rank him 10th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History. Nowitzki was selected by the Bucks in the 1998 NBA Draft (9th pick overall). The Mavericks acquired Nowitzki and Pat Garrity (19th pick) in exchange for Robert Taylor (6th pick), and later traded Garrity to the Suns for Steve Nash. In the meantime, Taylor’s NBA career lasted only 6 years. We know the rest. After 12 years of being the face of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Garnett was sent to the Boston Celtics on July 31, 2007 in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Theo Ratliff, cash and two draft picks. The deal constitutes the largest number of players traded for a single player in the NBA history. He made the 9th spot in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History for what it achieved later with one of the league’s most iconic franchises. Gernett played with Boston from 2007 to 2013. With them, he played 5 All Star Games, he won the 2008 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he scored 6,233 points with 1,078 assists and 3,301 rebounds and most importantly, he was a main piece in the team that won the NBA pennant in 2008, alongside Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, the “Big Three”. After a brief stint with New Jersey, since this season he’s back in Minnesota. Shaq is undoubtedly, one of the best centers in basketball history. After being part of the dynasty of Lakers in the early 2000’s, he was traded to the Miami Heat on July 14, 2004 in exchange for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant and one draft pick. At his arrive at Miami, Shaq promised he would bring a championship to the team. His promise came true in 2006 when the Miami Heat won their first championship trophy, although Shaq was not the best player (Dwyane Wade was). O’Neil played with Miami until 2008 and he scored 4,010 points with 437 assists and 1,856 rebounds and played three All Star Games. At the moment of his trade to Miami, he had won three NBA Finals MVP awards in a row and was the main piece of the Lakers that dominated the league in the previous years, and later he won one more championship with his new team, ranking 8th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history. He’s back to Cleveland, so we think the city has forgiven him since the decision. What most people think (or think to remember) is that James arrived to Miami as a free agency sign but it was actually a sign-and-trade deal between the Cavs and the Heat in exchange for future picks. After failing to win a Championship with the Cavaliers, James helped the Heat to win two NBA Championship as part of one the greatest trios in NBA history, composed of James, Chris Bosch and Dwayne Wade and that is why we picked it as 7th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history.\xa0 With Miami, James won also two NBA Finals MVP awards, played in three All Star Games and led the league in field goals with 758 in 2010-2011 and 765 in 2012-13 season, in two-pointers with 567 in 2011-12 and 662 in 2012-13. In four years with Miami he scored 7919 points with 1,980 assists and 2,225 rebounds. Kobe Bryant is probably the best player of his generation; he is undoubtedly one of the most popular and admired players of recent years and a winner: 5 NBA Championships. He has played 19 seasons in NBA, all of them with Los Angeles Lakers. In that span he has played 17 All Star Games, one MVP award, two NBA Finals MVP awards, led the league in games played three times, in field goals three times, in two-pointers three times, two times in free throws and four times in points. He has scored 32,482 points (3rd all-time), 8,146 free throws (3rd all time) and 11,321 field goals (7th all-time). An icon of the sport. What most people do not know is that Kobe arrived to Los Angeles through a trade. He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets in the 1996 draft as a 13th overall pick and later was traded to the Lakers, as agreed before the draft took place. Los Angeles didn’t tell the Hornets whom to select until 5 minutes before the draft. For what it represented later for the Lakers, he ranks 6th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history. The Bulls of the 90’s is, without any doubt, the most remembered team in the NBA history for their success, and much of this is due to Michael Jordan, but he did not win those Championships alone, he had a team and that team began with Scottie Pippen. In the 1987 NBA Draft, Pippen was selected by the Seattle Supersonics as the 5th overall pick and was sent later to the Bulls for Olden Polynice. Pippen later became one of the best defensive players of the league (8 times in a row selected for the NBA Defensive Team and the 1995 led in steals) and also a versatile scorer. He won six NBA Championships with the Bulls and played in 7 All Star Games. He ranks 5th in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history since he seemed to be the missing piece in a Championships winner machine led by Michael Jordan. In twelve seasons with the Bulls he scored 15,123 points with 4,494 assists, 1,792 steals and 2,401 turnovers. If statistics were the only indicator to choose the basketball best player of all-time, Chamberlain would probably win that recognition. Holder of numerous records and achievements, Chamberlain is an iconic figure in NBA history. It was not different back at the end of the 67-68 season when he won his fourth MVP award with the Philadelphia 76ers and he was traded to los Angeles Lakers in exchange of Darral Imhoff, Jerry Chambers and Archie Clark, marking the first time a MVP winner would be traded the following season. The trade remains as one of the most lopsided in the history of the league and ranks 4th in our list of the 10 greatest trades in NBA History. With the Lakers, he won the 1972 Championship, the NBA Finals MVP award that year and played four All Star Games, two times selected for the NBA Defensive Team and led the league in rebounds three times. He scored 5,985 points during his tenure with Los Angeles plus 1,461 assists and 6,524 rebounds. In 1980 the Golden State Warriors made a deal with the Boston Celtics: they sent Robert Parish (their 1st round pick in the 1976 draft) and their 3rd pick of the 1980 NBA draft in exchange for Boston’s 1st and 13th picks of the same draft. With their 1st pick, Golden State took Joe Barry Carroll and Rickey Brown with their 13th, meanwhile Boston took Kevin McHale as the 3rd overall selection. The trade ended up forming one of the NBA greatest dynasties as Parish and McHale, alongside Larry Bird, led the Celtics to three championships: 1981, 1984 and 1986. Parish played 14 seasons with Boston with whom he earned stardom, became one of the greatest centers of all time and played 9 All Star Games. During his tenure at Boston, he accumulated 18,245 points with 1,679 assists and 11,051 rebounds. Kevin McHale, for the other hand, came out of the bench at the beginning of his career, winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award twice; McHale played thirteen seasons in his career –all with Boston- and totalized 17,335 points, 1,670 assists and 7,122 rebounds. The trade that formed the NBA Greatest frontline in history ranks third in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA history. Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr., better known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, is one of the greatest NBA players of all time. He’s the all-time top scorer in the league with 38,387 points; his 17,440 rebounds rank third as well as his 3,189 blocks. He was Michael Jordan before Michael Jordan came to scene as he won 6 NBA Championships and the same number of MVP awards. Due to the historical impact of his, the trade that sent him to the Lakers from the Bucks in 1975 ranks second in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History. Jabbar arrived to the Lakers with Walt Wesley in exchange of Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman. In his first year with the Lakers he set the all-time record for most defensive rebounds with 1,111 and he became the last player to have 4,000 PRA (Points + Rebounds + Assists) in a year and won his 4th MVP award. Overall with the Lakers he won 5 NBA Championships, 3 MVP Awards, played 13 All Star Games, led the league in blocks two times, one time in rebounds and his uniform number 33 was retired. With the Lakers he scored 24,176 points (63% out of his total), 3,652 assists (64%), 10,279 rebounds (59%) and 2,694 blocks (84%). Bill Russell is an icon in basketball and one of the earliest. He made himself a legend with the Boston Celtics, a team with whom he played his entire 13 season career, winning 11 NBA Championships, 5 MVP Awards and 12 selections for the All Star Game. He was the first player to average more than 20 rebounds per game, he feat he accomplished 10 times. He’s second all-time in rebounds with 21,620 and led that department four times. He was definitely a better defensive player than offensive, as in his career he averaged only 15.1 points per game, had a .440 career field goal percentage and a 3.3 free throws per game and a success rate of .561, but he averaged 22.5 rebounds per game (second behind Chamberlain). The Boston Celtics acquired Russell through a trade and for his historical significance and sporting impact; it ranks first in our list of the 10 Greatest Trades in NBA History. Russell was originally picked up by the Saint Louis Hawks in the 1956 NBA Draft, but they could not afford his contract and traded him to Boston (that were already interested in Russell) in exchange for Ed Macauley, Boston’s star at the time and who was willing to be sent to Saint Louis. Boston also sent Cliff Hagan and everybody happy. There are more trades that could have made the cut, we did not go for the most lopsided or shocking but for those that had the greater impact in the history of basketball best league in the world.

Along with his friends, Dru Joyce III, Sian Cotton and Willie McGee, he achieved success at a local as well as national level in the sport.

The new Sugar Act replaced the Molasses Act of 1733, reducing by half the colonial tax on molasses, but stepping up enforcement of the tax. The Sugar Act not only affected molasses but expanded the diversity of goods that could be taxed. Sugar, wine, and essentially all sugar products, as well as clothing, were to be taxed and strictly enforced. In 1773 the British Parliament passed the Molasses Act. This act levied a tax on all molasses that was being imported into the colonies from islands in the West Indies; which were not British colonies. Prior to the passage of the Molasses Act, the colonist would get molasses from all islands of the West Indies, including those possessed by the French, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese. Molasses was an important ingredient in the colonial era. It is a byproduct of sugar cane refinement and has many uses. It was the number one source of sweetener in the world, up until the 1880s and essential for the distillation of rum. The rum industry in the West Indies was one of its major sources of income. It was essential in the slave trade between the Colonies, the Indies, and Africa. The problem with molasses was created due to the fact that the non-British West Indian islands were better producers of sugar cane, and therefore molasses. Those islands were able to produce more molasses and thus were capable of selling it at a lower cost to the American colonists. The non-British West Indian islands were also better trading partners. The British islands refused to purchase colonial exports such as fish, lumber, and flour because they did not need it, the non-British islands were in need of these items. The colonist was also prohibited from trading with the British West Indies in grain or livestock because it would compete with Great Britain’s market, therefore they were sold to the non-British islands. Due to these factors; refusal to buy products; outlawing the sale of others; and the higher price of molasses; the purchase of molasses from the British West Indies became virtually non-existent. After complaints about this, the British passed the Molasses Act of 1733 which, did not forbid the purchase of molasses from non-British isles but levied a tax upon all molasses imported into the colonies from non-British isles. The enforcement of the Molasses Act was difficult, if not non-existent. The colonist found numerous loopholes in the way the tax was enforced. Such ways around the law included going to ports off route and unloading the products bought in the non-British West Indies prior to reaching their destination and thus avoiding the tax collector. The colonists would also alter markings on products indicating their point of origin and even bribe tax collection officers. This law proved to be completely unmanageable but remained in effect until 1763 when the Act expired. Due to Great Britain’s involvement in the French and Indian War, known in American history as the Seven Years War, the British suffered an enormous amount of debt. In addition, due to the French and Indian War, the British Empire felt it essential to keep a standing army in the colonies, not only to protect from invasion but to enforce laws against the American colonists. The Molasses Act of 1733 had just expired a year earlier and the British Empire decided to renew the tax but with some changes. Therefore Parliament passed the Sugar Act of 1764. It was the first tax enacted by the British against the colonists for the purpose of raising revenue. The Sugar Act created a new tax on molasses imported from non-British isles along the same lines as the Molasses Act but the tax was reduced by half. Even though the theoretical cost was diminished the Sugar Act required explicit enforcement. In addition to molasses, the tax was levied on foreign-made coffee, sugar, pimento, and wine. It also limited the quantity of lumber and iron that the colonists were permitted to export to those islands. In addition, the Sugar Act created a new court system for which evaders of the law were to be tried. Enforcement of the Molasses Act was difficult, part of it stems from the fact that any individuals tried for suspected smuggling of molasses was prosecuted in the colonies by a jury of their peers. The jurors, who were colonists themselves, were always sympathetic to the smugglers and guilty verdicts, no matter how damning the evidence was non-existent. Under the Sugar Act, the suspected smugglers were brought prosecuted in Admiralty Court in Nova Scotia and removed any possibility of having a favorable jury. The Admiralty Courts, despite being inconvenient and removing sympathetic colonists from the jury pool, were also corrupt. A judge on a smuggling case was able to receive 5% of the worth of the cargo if he was able to find the defendant guilty of the smuggling charge. In addition, the colonists themselves had to pay their own expenses to get to Nova Scotia for their own trials. For these, and many other reasons, the Sugar Act became a deterrent to illegal smuggling and helped reduce trade between the Colonies and the rest of the western world. The effects of the Sugar Act of 1764 were immediate and widespread. Because the colonists were forced to pay more for molasses, they were also forced to pay higher prices for rum, and therefore exports of the product diminished. In addition, the Sugar Act established the British West Indies as their only serious export. As a result the demand for rum greatly outweighed the supply that was available to the colonists. In addition, the colonies had no trading partners for other products. . Fully aware of this, the British West Indies were permitted to do whatever they wanted. The prices for molasses, rum, and other native products skyrocketed while the prices for American-made products diminished greatly. They were still forbidden by law to export grain or livestock to the British West Indies and the islands had no use for many of their other products. The Colonies sank into a dramatic recession and the colonists, naturally, blamed their problems on the tax and oppression of the British Empire. As a result of the Sugar Act of 1764 and the resulting economic downturn, the colonists began to, for the first time, openly protest the British Parliament’s intervention in colonial affairs. The colonists were adamant about the idea that Parliament had absolutely no right to levy taxes upon them. This is actually the first time in American history that the phrase “no taxation without representation” is seen. In response to the Sugar, Act colonists formed an organized boycott of luxury goods imported from Great Britain. 50 merchants from throughout the colonies agreed to boycott specific items and began a philosophy of self-sufficiency where they produce those products themselves, especially fabric-based products. The boycott led to the rise of certain individuals who would be leaders in the revolutionary war such as Samuel Adams and James Otis. In addition to the boycott, the Massachusetts Colonial Legislature formed a committee to address the matter which resulted in the drafting of a letter to Parliament to address the frustration and arguments against the Sugar Act. Following the initial letter, drafted by Samuel Adams, many other letters were sent from different committees. All in total 50 letters were delivered to Parliament in response to the Sugar Act. The Sugar Act was effectively repealed in 1765 due to the overwhelming anger from the colonists. However, the British Parliament instead imposed what is known as the Stamp Act. The Stamp Act of 1765 required that all paper products used in the colonies had to contain a stamp that signified that it was legal tender. The products included newspapers, magazines, playing cards, etc. It was a lucrative proposition for the British because there was guaranteed revenue and little to no enforcement was necessary. If a document was to be deemed legal, in the eyes of the British government, it had to have a stamp.

The preamble to the act stated: ""it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this Kingdom ... and ... it is just and necessary that a revenue should be raised ... for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same."" The earlier Molasses Act 1733, which had imposed a tax of six pence per gallon of molasses, had never been effectively collected due to colonial evasion. By reducing the rate by half and increasing measures to enforce the tax, the British hoped that the tax would actually be collected. These incidents increased the colonists' concerns about the intent of the British Parliament and helped the growing movement that became the American Revolution."
where did the name london broil come from,"['When it’s holiday time, a lot happens and the smell of meat hitting our nostrils cannot be ignored. Also, words start getting thrown from here to there, people trying to get their share of the much-needed commodity. In the rush, you won’t fail to hear the commonly used words like London broil and Flank steak. These are excellent choices of meat for at-home Philly cheesesteak, bibimbap, stir-fries, and other favorite beef meals. Some buyers and butchers will call flank steak London boil while others will refer to flank steak as London broil. It’s a big confusion yes, especially for anyone who does not have an idea of the various meat categorizations. In light of that, this post seeks to bring out the differences between the Flank steak and London Broil. As it is always with these posts, it does not intend to give an opinion on what meat is better than the other. Also, it does not seek to weigh the options for you as the buyer. The flank steak is a beef steak that is usually cut from the lower chest or abdominal muscles of a cow. Commonly, the cut is associated with Colombia and is usually referred to as sobrebarriga which literary means “over the belly”. In South America, a thin flank steak is referred to as a matambre in Spanish. It is also known as a fraldinha in Brazil, literally meaning “little diaper”. This is because of its position that is near the cow’s groin as well as its shape that resembles a cloth diaper. The flank steak is relatively a long and flat cut and is used in a variety of dishes. The dishes include the London broil and can also be used as a substitute for the traditional skirt steak in fajitas. The flank steak can be pan-fried, grilled, braised for increased tenderness, or broiled. The London broil is a beef dish usually made by boiling marinated beef and then cutting it across the grain in thin strips. Regardless of the name London broil, the dish, as well as the terminology, are North American and not British. The traditionally used cut meat for the London broil is the flank steak. However, some people will use the blade roast, top rounds, or the sirloin tip roasts in this dish. Many butchers will label such cuts as top round steak and roast as London broil even though the term does not refer to any specific cut of meat. It only refers to the method of preparation and cookery. Preparing the London broil usually involves the margination of the meat for several hours. The margination is then followed by high heat searing in an outdoor grill or oven broiler. Then, it is served in thin slices that are cut across the grain. If it is cut and used for sandwiches, it is usually rarer than any traditional roast beef. Even though the two have several differences, they also have some similarities. The main ones are that the two are characterized by thin slices and have plenty of pink meat. The flank steak is cut from the lower section of the cow or the abdominal muscles. The area is usually the succulent loin, but it’s before the muscular sinews of the round. The London broil, on the other hand, is a beef dish that is made from boiling marinated beef. The flank steak is a meat cut that is mostly used in the style of preparation while London broil refers to a method of cooking the flank steak. Even though some butchers and even cooks often use the terms London broil and flank steak interchangeably to describe the same cuts, these two are not at all synonymous. To the identity-conscious culinary pedants, the two can never be used in place of each other. As the name suggests, the flank steak is a meat cut sourced from a specific area of a cow, while the London broil is usually a method of cooking the various lean cuts similar to and including the flank steak. Simply, it can be concluded that the London broil is a method of cooking while the flank steak is a cut of meat mostly used in the style of preparation. I think there are some serious spell check problems here.  The word  “margination” means the act of forming a margin, I think you meant marinate the act of soaking something in a marinade.  Additionally you seem to use boil and broil interchangeably.  To boil meat after you have marinaded it would be almost criminal.  I guess the MFA program at Amherst didn’t care about spelling. “The flank steak is a beef steak that is usually cut from the lower chest or abdominal muscles of a cow. Commonly, the cut is associated with Colombia and is usually referred to as sobrebarriga which literary means “over the belly”. The local supermarkets sell a cut of beef as London broil before it is cooked. I doubt if they are referring to a method of cooking.

Held annually on September 30th, saint’s day of Saint Jerome\xa0(the biblical translator considered to be the patron saint of translators), the idea was officially launched in 1991 by the International Federation of Translators\xa0(FIT) in order to raise the profile of the language industry. Although\xa0Saint Jerome was an early Christian (he produced the first Latin translation of the Bible and wrote texts on the art of translation) International Translation Day is\xa0secular and non-denominational. The International Federation of Translators is a worldwide federation of professional associations bringing together translators, interpreters and terminologists, with 107 members in more than 60 countries representing over 80,000 professionals. 2013’s celebrations coincide with the 60th anniversary of FIT, founded in 1953.\xa0FIT says: The enormous diversity of languages and dialects in the world creates barriers to communication on a daily basis, affecting all areas of life. Human migration and globalization highlight the need for seamless communication across cultures. Professional translators, terminologists and interpreters have an essential role in this regard. Sometimes working under difficult circumstances, for example in fluctuating market conditions or in conflict zones, they nevertheless consistently work to overcome language barriers and bring people closer together. TTIs (translators, terminologists and interpreters) work at all levels of society. Not only do interpreters help politicians negotiate complicated treaties and agreements to avoid international conflicts and wars, but they also help parents obtain the necessary treatment for a sick child in an emergency room. Translators ensure that machinery can be used safely around the world through professionally-translated technical manuals, and that software is localized so that we can all use it in our primary language. Thanks to translators, we can all enjoy the great literary masterpieces. Every year more and more events celebrate translators’ work, and I’ve listed a few of them below. One that particularly touched me this year was being interviewed by colleague Emeline Jamoul in a series of 10 interviews on\xa0her blog specially created to celebrate\xa0International Translation Day ’13.\xa0Emeline is an English and Spanish>French translator and owner of\xa0In Touch Translations,\xa0based in Belgium. Other translators interviewed include:\xa0Olga Arakelyan,\xa0Megan Onions,\xa0Catherine Christaki,\xa0Tess Whitty,\xa0Nicole Y. Adams,\xa0Judy Jenner,\xa0Carolyn Yohn,\xa0Sara Colombo, and\xa0Lloyd Bingham. You can read my interview\xa0here. These are just a few events being held this year; other events have already taken place, and yet others are more informal. 1)\xa0Translationum\xa0is a list of books translated in the world, or in other words an international bibliography of translations. Translationum was created in 1932 by the League of Nations, and references registered before 1979 can be found in the printed editions of the Index Translationum\xa0(available in all National depository libraries and at the UNESCO library in Paris). In 1979 records were computerised and the modern database is\xa0regularly\xa0updated. It\xa0contains bibliographical information on books translated and published in about one hundred UNESCO member states, and now totals more than 2 million entries in all areas: literature, natural and exact sciences,\xa0social and human sciences,\xa0history, art, etc.\xa0International cooperation has made the “Index Translationum” unique.\xa0Every year the national libraries or\xa0bibliography centres in participating countries send \xa0bibliographical data on translated books in all fields of knowledge to UNESCO\xa0(periodicals, articles from periodicals, patents and brochures are not included).\xa0Index Translationum celebrated its 80th\xa0anniversary in 2012 and on that occasion a\xa0debate\xa0on its usefulness and future was held at UNESCO’s headquarters. According to the\xa0Index the 10 most translated authors are currently:\xa0Agatha Christie,\xa0Jules Verne,\xa0Shakespeare,\xa0Enid Blyton,\xa0Barbara Cartland,\xa0Danielle Steel,\xa0Lenin,\xa0Hans Christian Andersen,\xa0Stephen King, and\xa0Jacob Grimm. \xa0The 10 countries publishing the most translations are: Germany, Spain, France, Japan, USSR (to 1991), Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Denmark and China. The top 10 target languages are: German, French, Spanish, English, Japanese, Dutch, Russian, Portuguese, Polish, Swedish, and the top 10 source languages are: English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Danish and Latin. Many other statistics are available here. So for example if you want to know if such and such an author has already been translated, and if so into which languages, Translationum is the place to go! In this UNESCO compilation of the most translated authors, the size of the last name corresponds to the number of translations (listed below name). Colour indicates language of original publication. 2) The second resource, also from UNESCO, is their Collection of Representative Works, also known as the Catalogue of Representative Works. This was a direct subsidy translation programme active for about 57 years from 1948 until 2005 when funding stopped. In order to increase cultural understanding and cooperation the aim was to encourage translation, publication and distribution of world literary and cultural masterpieces,\xa0primarily from a lesser known language into a more international one such as English and/or French. There are 1060 works in the catalogue from about 80 countries and over 100 languages, around fifty of which were Oriental, twenty European, and several languages and literatures from Oceania and Africa. Some works were also translated into lesser known languages, such as Urdu into Hungarian, or Japanese into\xa0Indonesian. Although UNESCO financed the translations and publications, it was not the publisher – books were published as co-editions with publishers from all over the world. The major languages that texts have been translated into, with the number of works translated into that language, are:\xa0English (455), French (450),\xa0Spanish (71),\xa0Arabic\xa0(38), and\xa0German\xa0(25).\xa0Authors with a significant number of translations include:\xa0Natsume Soseki\xa0(11),\xa0Yasunari Kawabata\xa0(9),\xa0Rumi\xa0(8), Julio Cortázar\xa0(7),\xa0Rabindranath Tagore\xa0(7),\xa0Yukio Mishima\xa0(5), and\xa0Mohammad Iqbal\xa0(5). Thanks to UNESCO’s efforts – and, of course, to the translators who make it all possible – ideas, information, beliefs and customs\xa0can thus be shared around the world. A reference by Catherine Jan on Facebook to ‘Canadian bacon‘ being unknown as such in Canada got me thinking about misnamed food – food that is named after a place but actually has little or nothing to do with that same place. For example I grew up hearing the term ‘Swiss muesli’, but when I visited that country as a 15-year-old I was surprised to learn that local muesli was pretty different to what I’d grown up with! Here’s a list of ‘misnamed’ food I’ve come up with – feel free to add more you may know of in the comments below. On a final note, living in a French-speaking country I’ve sometimes been asked in French if I want some “cake” or “pudding” [sic]. Over the years I’ve come to know that these refer to specific cakes and a dessert in French cuisine, but at first I was rather taken aback by the use of the generic wide-ranging English term for something that actually turned out to be quite specific. P.S. From\xa022-24 May 2014 the\xa0Department of Interpreting and Translation (DIT) of the University of Bologna will hold\xa0the First International Conference on Food and Culture in Translation. It will take place in\xa0Bertinoro,\xa0a tiny hamlet above the town of Forlimpopoli, home to the 19th century Italian food critic, food guru and gourmet, Pellegrino Artusi, author of the book: The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well.

what is the chemical composition of citric acid,"['2918.14.00 C6H8O7.H2O C6H8O7.H2O Citric acid is a weak organic acid with formula C6H8O7, which occurs naturally in citrus fruits. It is part of the citric acid cycle which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms. Globally, more than a million tons of citric acid are produced annually, and more than 70% of the total production is used in the food and beverage industry as an acidifier or antioxidant to preserve or enhance the flavors and aromas of fruit juice, ice cream, and marmalades. Citric acid exists in the form of anhydrous, which is crystallized in hot water, or monohydrate, which is crystallized in cold water. The anhydrous form of citric acid can be produced by heating citric acid monohydrate. Citric acid is produced by submerged fermentation using fungus from different sources of carbohydrates, such as molasses and starch-based media. As precipitation, calcium oxide is added to form the slightly soluble tri-calcium citrate tetrahydrate. The precipitate is removed by filtration and washed to remove impurities. It is treated with sulphuric acid to form calcium sulfate and filtered off. The citric acid liquid is then treated with active carbon and passed through a cation and anion exchanger. Finally, the liquid is concentrated in vacuum crystallizers at 20 - 25℃, forming citric acid monohydrate. Citric acid is widely used in the food and beverage industry for different purposes. Some food that contains citric acid includes jellies, jams, candies, dairy product, frozen fruit, oils, and animal feed. Beverages such as wine, ciders, soft drinks, and syrups also contain citric acid. Citric acid can be used for pH adjustment and preservation and can be used as an antioxidant agent, sequestering agent, acidulate, and flavor enhancer. Citric acid is also used in pharmaceuticals. It is combined with bicarbonates to use as an effervescent and anticoagulant. It is also used to adjust pH and as an antioxidant agent. Citric acid is used to increase the solubility of brown heroin. It is also used as feed in the production of antiviral tissues. Citric acid is used as an agricultural repellent against frogs, especially in Hawaiian plants. As a corrosive and acidic compound, the amount of citric acid for plants must be specified. Adding too much citric acid can cause acidic soil, which can burn the plant root and cause the plant’s death. Citric acid is used to remove metal oxides for the operational cleaning of iron and copper oxides. In industrial applications, citric acid is used as a buffering and neutralizing agent. It is also used in non-corrosive, non-toxic, and biodegradable processes and safety standards. Other uses include ceramic manufacture, ion complexion, leather tanning, copper plating, floor cement, adhesive, waste treatment, electroplating, textile, bottle washing compound, etc. © 2023 Tradeasia Internasional Inc.

Hesperidin is a flavonone glycoside (flavonoid) (C28H34O15) found abundantly in citrus fruits. Its aglycone form is called hesperetin. Hesperidin is believed to play a role in plant defense. It acts as an antioxidant according to in vitro studies. In human nutrition it contributes to the integrity of the blood vessels. Various preliminary studies reveal novel pharmaceutical properties. Heperidin reduced cholesterol and blood pressure in rats. In a mouse study large doses of the glucoside hesperidin decreased bone density loss. Another animal study showed protective effects against sepsis. Hesperidin is used to reduce hay fever and other allergic conditions by inhibiting the release of histamine from mast cells. The possible anti-cancer activity of hesperidin could be explained by the inhibition of polyamine synthesis. Hesperidin improves the health of capillaries by reducing the capillary permeability. Actions:  Hesperidin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, vasoprotective, anti-carcinogenic and cholesterol lowering actions. Hesperdin can inhibit following enzymes: phospholipase A2, lipoxygenase, HMG-CoA reductase and cyclo-oxygenase. Phyto Ionic Silver is a transition metal that is a germicide that kills algae, bacteria, fungus, molds, protozoa and viruses. Coenzyme Q10 is essential for the health of cells, tissues, and organs, and acts as a catalyst for countless chemical reactions in the human body. It also helps people with angina, diabetes, gingivitis, and helps to lower blood pressure. Co Enzyme Q10 acts an antioxidant that destroys free radicals, helps in weight loss because it stimulates metabolism. Helps in cell respiration, cell respiration, electron transfer, ATP production, control of oxidation reactions, plays a key role in treatment of cardiovascular illnesses, including congestive heart failure. CoQ10 also acts as a catalyst in various chemical reactions that leads to the production of energy. Clinical studies have also shown that CoQ10 can treat periodontal disease and being investigated in treating cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsons, Huntingtons and Alzheimers and even immune system disorders including AIDS. Xylitol is a naturally occurring sweetener found in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables, including various berries, corn husks, oats, and mushrooms. Xylitol is roughly as sweet as sucrose but with two-thirds the food energy and less calories than sugar with less impact on blood sugar levels. Recent research on Xylitol confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests that the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then starves harmful micro-organisms. This same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms. Xylitol is absorbed more slowly than sugar, it doesn't contribute to high blood sugar levels or the resulting hyperglycemia caused by insufficient insulin response. Finnish researchers have found that dietary Xylitol prevents weakening of bones in laboratory rats, and actually improves bone density. Stevia helps and has been used by some to lower blood sugar for diabetes, increase urination, lower blood pressure, dilate blood vessels, kill bacteria, kill fungi, kill viruses, reduce inflammation for cavity prevention, and a weight loss aid. Over 100 phytochemicals have been discovered in Stevia. It is rich in terpenes and flavonoids. The main plant chemicals in Stevia include: apigenin, austroinulin, avicularin, beta-sitosterol, caffeic acid, campesterol, caryophyllene, centaureidin, chlorogenic acid, chlorophyll, cosmosiin, cynaroside, daucosterol, diterpene glycosides, dulcosides A-B, foeniculin, formic acid, gibberellic acid, gibberellin, indole-3-acetonitrile, isoquercitrin, isosteviol, jhanol, kaempferol, kaurene, lupeol, luteolin, polystachoside, quercetin, quercitrin, rebaudioside A-F, scopoletin, sterebin A-H, steviol, steviolbioside, steviolmonoside, stevioside, stevioside a-3, stigmasterol, umbelliferone, and xanthophylls.

Vegetable Glycerin is a clear, colorless, and odorless liquid with an incredibly sweet taste having the consistency of thick syrup. It is used as an agent in cosmetics, toothpaste, shampoos, soaps, herbal remedies, pharmaceuticals, and other household items. Vegetable Glycerin is soluble in both, water and alcohol, its versatility is a major benefactor in its purported growth and popularity within the manufacturing sector. It is invaluable as a natural source ingredient with emollient like properties which can soften and soothe the skin and it assists the outer epidermis is retaining moisture. Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide used as a food additive and rheology modifier. It is produced by a process involving fermentation of glucose or sucrose by the Xanthomonas campestris bacterium. It is also a preferred method of thickening liquids for those with swallowing disorders, since it does not change the color or flavor of foods or beverages. Other uses include its solvency action which aids herbalists in extracting botanical properties from plant materials without the use of alcohol. This is especially helpful for those with alcohol sensitivities as most liquid herbal extracts contain alcohol. Guar gum is extracted from the guar bean and used by some as a thickener or an emulsifier because it helps to prevent oil droplets from coalescing or as a stabilizer because it helps to prevent solid particles from settling. Guar gum is a water-soluble fiber that acts as a bulk forming laxative, and as such, it is claimed to be effective in promoting regular bowel movements and relieve constipation and chronic related functional bowel ailments; such as diverticulosis, Crohn's disease, colitis and irritable bowel syndrome, among others. Helps stimulate the movement of waste and toxins from the system, which is particularly helpful for good colon health, because it speeds the removal of waste and bacteria from the bowel and colon. In addition, because it is soluble, it is able to absorb toxic substances (bacteria) that cause infective diarrhea. Fulvic Acid is an acid that occurs naturally in organic decaying plant matter and soils which has the ability to readily dissolve and bond minerals and nutritional elements into its molecular structure. Nutrients that have been chelated by Fulvic Acid are in an ideal natural form to interact with and be absorbed by living cells. Fulvic Acid is so powerful that one single Fulvic Acid molecule is capable of carrying 60 or more minerals and trace elements into the cells.

which was a factor that led to bacon's rebellion,"[""In 1607, members of a joint venture called the Virginia Company founded Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America on the banks of the James River. Famine, disease and conflict with local Native American tribes (the Powhatan Tribe) in the first two years brought Jamestown to the brink of failure before the arrival of a new group of settlers and supplies in 1610. Named for Queen Elizabeth I of England (known as the Virgin Queen). Bacon's Rebellion- Bacon's Rebellion was an armed rebellion in 1676 by Virginia settlers led by Nathaniel Bacon against the rule of Governor William Berkeley. The colony's disorganized frontier political structure, combined with accumulating grievances (including leaving Bacon out of his inner circle, refusing to allow Bacon to be a part of his fur trade with the Native Americans, Indian attacks), helped to motivate a popular uprising against Berkeley, who had failed to address the demands of the colonists regarding their safety. About a thousand Virginians of all classes rose up in arms against Berkeley, attacking Native Americans, chasing Berkeley from Jamestown, Virginia, and ultimately torching the capital. The rebellion was first suppressed by a few armed merchant ships from London whose captains sided with Berkeley and the loyalists. Government forces from England arrived soon after and spent several years defeating pockets of resistance and reforming the colonial government to one more directly under royal control. The trade that pertains to Virginia is Tobacco and Glass Artifacts. After receiving Tobacco seeds from Europe, Virginians began to export Tobacco to everyone. The Glass Artifacts were traded among themselves. Religion and politics are intimately linked in Colonial Virginia. The Church of England practiced a form of Protestant Christianity that in some ways resembled Catholicism.

what are two towers in lord of the rings,"['The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a film which was directed by Peter Jackson, with a theatrical runtime of 179 minutes (2 hours, 59 minutes). It is the second part in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. It\'s screenplay is written by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It is an adaptation of the book The Two Towers, the second part of the three-volume novel The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, although some of the later events are held over to the later third movie, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.The film premiered at Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, on Thursday, 5 December, 2002. It was very well received critically and was an enormous box-office success, making over $900 million worldwide (making it the fourth most successful film of all time at that point in time). The surviving members of the Fellowship of the Ring have split into three groups. Frodo and Sam face many perils on their continuing quest to save Middle-earth by destroying the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs and must convince the Ents to join the battle against evil. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter a mysteriously transformed Gandalf and battle Saruman\'s army at Helm\'s Deep. * denotes a scene only available in the Extended Edition cut of the film. ** denotes a scene which includes extended content only available in the Extended Edition cut of the film. Jackson\'s The Two Towers differs from Tolkien\'s in several important ways. Arwen does not appear in the second book at all. Interviews with Jackson and the other writers on the extended DVD version of the movie make it clear that they are fully aware of the implications of these changes in terms of the original story, and have chosen to make them not out of ignorance but in order to make the story work better in terms of motion picture storytelling. Notably the meaning of the title itself, \'The Two Towers\', has been changed. Tolkien considered many possible combinations, but eventually settled on Orthanc and Minas Morgul being the \'two towers\'. However, in Jackson\'s movie Saruman instead names them as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, which is also reflected in the movie poster. Tolkien divided The Two Towers into two distinct parts. The first told the stories of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and Gandalf. The second concerned Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Jackson chose to intercut between the two to present the events in chronological order. Jackson\'s structure changes the tale from a pure quest to a war story. Each of the film\'s three main threads make the point that the war has started and that our heroes are in the thick of it. Théoden\'s attitude towards the coming conflict is also presented differently in Jackson\'s film: In the novel, Théoden chooses to ride to war, and only goes to Helm\'s Deep in order to assist Erkenbrand\'s forces, which had been dealt a defeat by Saruman\'s armies. In the film, he opts to avoid open confrontation, and treats Helm\'s Deep as a shelter for the civilian population of Rohan. Only the ensuing orc siege forces him into battle. The theatrical edition of the movie was released on VHS and DVD on Tuesday, August 26, 2003. The DVD was a 2-disc set with extras on the second disc. This was intended to be a simultaneous worldwide release, but some British stores began selling the videos on Friday 22 because it was a Bank Holiday weekend, much to the ire of the film\'s UK distributor, which has threatened to withhold advance supplies of subsequent video releases. An extended version of the movie including 44 minutes of additional material was released on video on Tuesday, November 18, 2003, with a total of 223 minutes (3 hours, 43 minutes). One of the additional scenes features Sean Bean and John Noble, who do not appear in the theatrical version, in a flashback in which brothers Boromir and Faramir are seen together with their father Denethor. This is available on VHS and on a 4-disc DVD set, with the movie on discs 1 and 2 including four audio commentaries by the crew and actors, and extensive bonus material on discs 3 and 4. There is also a ""Special Edition"" DVD package containing the 4-disc set, a sculpture of Gollum, a booklet about the process of designing Gollum for the movie and a short DVD documentary on the process of designing collectible sculptures based on the movies\' characters and artefacts. In December, 2003 there were also limited back-to-back theatrical releases of the extended versions of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers followed by premieres of The Return of the King, in all nine hours and seventeen minutes long. In the Foster\'s Home for Imaginary Friends episode ""Duchess of Wails"", the end of the episode is a homage to the attack on Helm\'s Deep from the movie. Certain lines are used in the scene\'s dialogue as well as memorable visual moments, like the initial volley of arrows (tomatoes in the episode) are also used.', ""Real money casinos are incredibly popular in the UK, and for good reason.

The main incentive to play real money casino games is the opportunity to win real money. This could be a big payout from sports betting, or the result of successful rounds of online blackjack. There is also the potential to win large sums of money from progressive jackpots. Playing real money casino games is exciting due to the potential of winning big rewards, which can be life-changing for some players. Therefore, it is important to understand that playing for real money is necessary in order to experience such great rewards. Aside from video slots, there are numerous other real money casino games available to players. These include classic table games like online blackjack, roulette and baccarat in their video versions. Video poker is also a popular choice among UK players. Additionally, there are crypto-based Provably Fair titles and unique game genres like Slingo. Live casino games cannot be played in demo mode since they involve real dealers. Playing with dummy chips in a real-world casino is not productive, so trying to do this online would be pointless. There are more than online blackjack, roulette, and baccarat - TV game show live dealer games such as Deal or No Deal Live are also available. These games provide a fun and interactive experience for players and challenge them to think on their feet as they play in real time with the dealer. It can be quite different from playing standard online casino games making it an exciting gaming experience. Real money gambling sites are transparent in how they make money, and provide players with the chance to potentially win real money. Social gambling games, however, employ more deceptive tactics that can be detrimental to players. These can include sharing your data and showing numerous ads, as well as charging microtransactions for extra features. It's important to be aware of these tactics when playing social gambling games, so you are aware of any potential risks that may be involved. Playing at a UK Gambling Commission-licensed online casino is the only way to ensure your safety and security when playing real money casino games. All UKGC-licensed sites must meet strict standards of safety and security, giving you peace of mind that your personal information and money are protected. Playing online slots or other casino games through social media platforms such as Facebook cannot guarantee the same level of protection, so it is always best to stick with licensed and regulated sites for your online gaming needs. There are both arguments for and against participating in real money casino games. Let's review the points we have discussed now. One of the key benefits of playing demo or free-play versions of online casino games is the ability to try out different features first-hand without risking any money. This allows you to get familiar with the game mechanics in your own time and make sure that you understand exactly how everything works before gambling with real money. Demo version games let you “try before you buy” so that you can be confident when playing for real money. Unfortunately, this option is not available at real money casinos, as you cannot practice games without investing your own cash. Demo play can be a great way to familiarize yourself with online casino games that require strategy or knowledge of the rules. For instance, playing free versions of poker online before you start playing for real money can help you learn the game and improve your skills. With real money casinos, there is usually no option to practice first and you have to dive right in. For those who would like to enjoy the excitement of casino games without putting their hard earned money at risk, there are a number of no-deposit online casinos that offer real money gaming with no risk. At these casinos, players can play their favorite games and even win prizes without having to put any money on the line. This is a great way to experience the thrill and excitement of casino gambling without worrying about potentially losing your own funds. When playing casino games for real money at an online casino, you can be sure that the games are fair and not rigged. This is because most sites use Random Number Generators (RNG) which are regularly tested by eCogra to ensure that they are producing random and unbiased outcomes. Live Casino games have additionally been subject to rigorous standards and safeguards in order to ensure fairness, as they are video streamed from live casinos or audio-video studios, making it impossible to influence the game's outcomes. As a result, you can play your favorite online casino games with confidence knowing that the results will be truly random. When researching different casino games, you will come across the RTP (or return to player) percentage. This is an important factor for many players as it gives you a sense of how often you are likely to win back over time. For example, if you play an online slot with an RTP of 95%, you can expect to receive £95 for every £100 bet on average. Most online slots have an RTP between 95-97%, but some games go even higher. It's important to remember that gambling is reliant on luck and therefore the RTP is not a guaranteed return - one player could play £100 and not win anything, while another hits a jackpot on their first spin. Online slots have higher RTPs than land-based casinos because the overhead costs associated with running a slot site are lower than those in real-life venues (e.g. staff, rent, utilities). Additionally, volatility should also be taken into consideration along with the RTP as it relates to the size of individual winnings; low volatility slots will pay out more often but with similar amounts per win, while higher volatility slots may have larger prize pots but they don't occur as frequently. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) is a government body established to regulate gambling activities in the United Kingdom as part of the Gambling Act 2005. It works alongside local licensing authorities to oversee the online gambling market. If you are unsure if an online casino or betting site is legitimate, you can check for a UKGC licence number on the website's footer or homepage. You can then verify that the license is valid by checking it against the Gambling Commission’s online register. This will ensure that the site is operating within legal and ethical guidelines. In order to qualify for a remote gambling licence, online casinos must prove to the UKGC that they have satisfactory monetary policies and safety protocols in place. All approved UK online casinos religiously follow rigorous laws with the goal of shielding players from harm and theft. Through obtaining a valid license to accept real cash customers, these are some of the criteria an online casino should meet: Certain online casinos we recommend can only accommodate UK players, while other international casinos may be regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), Alderney Gambling Control Commission, or Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association (GBGA). For gambling sites to be allowed to operate in Great Britain, they must obtain a remote gambling licence from the UKGC, which has stringent requirements. There are plenty of real money casinos available to UK players. The difficulty is in choosing just one of them. But this is where the real money casino guide comes to the rescue. By reading our top tips and selecting a real money casino from above, you’re already halfway there. In fact, finding the best real money casinos has never been so easy. Just bear in mind our notes on safety and security and you’ll be golden. Then it’s just a matter of choosing which real money games to play first. Good luck!

If you're aiming to win real money, the UK is home to an abundance of online casinos that offer plenty of opportunities. But if we were to give advice, it would be this: steer clear from social casino games on Facebook and other platforms. Instead, select one of the many online casinos regulated by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC). That way you'll know your experience will be safe! If you're looking for safe and secure options to fund your online gambling experience, look no further than the payment methods this casino offers. From debit/credit cards to e-Wallets such as PayPal and Trustly, there's a wide array of reliable services that make it easier than ever before for players to deposit funds safely into their accounts. Pick the one that works best for you—and get ready for some exciting gaming! Most online casinos require you to deposit at least £10. Some UK casinos allow players to deposit as low as £1 or £3. Once you sign up and deposit money at a UK casino, they provide players with an exciting bonus in the form of real cash. This may sound too good to be true, but there are specific conditions that must be met before any winnings can be collected. These requirements come in the shape of wagering demands which range from 10x to 200x your initial deposit amount. Absolutely. By 2023, many online casino websites will provide real money gaming applications for their players to download and use from the comfort of their own device or play directly in an internet browser.

Tally Jr. IN THE OFFICIAL TRAILER\xa0for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, viewers get a tantalizing glimpse of Saruman, no more than two seconds long, intoning in Christopher Lee’s inimitable basso profundo, “Leave Sauron to me!” For fans of Tolkien and of the genre he helped launch, the prospect of a showdown between the two most powerful persons in all of Middle-earth is delicious. But, of course, we know that the showdown never takes place. The now six-film saga of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings has made sure to emphasize Saruman’s inherent evil. Although The Battle of the Five Armies does include that scene in which Saruman fights alongside Elrond and Galadriel against the servants of Sauron, the implication in the end is that the White Wizard is really helping Sauron to escape. The oversimplification of Saruman is, in my view, one of the more egregious mistakes made by Peter Jackson and his team. They have taken one of the most interesting — because conflicted and flawed — characters in J. R. R. Tolkien’s story, and turned him into a boringly one-dimensional movie villain. He is evil, and that’s that. One of the knocks on Tolkien has been that his world is too neatly divided into good and evil, with the saintly elves, heroic men, doughty dwarves, and innocent hobbits standing their righteous ground against hordes of demonic orcs, trolls, evil or fallen men (who are sometimes coded as racial outsiders as well), and some great Satan. This simplistic moral universe has even been taken as a hallmark of fantasy fiction, by such imminent critics of the genre as Darko Suvin, Fredric Jameson, and Carl Freedman, who favor what they take to the political complexity of science fiction. The “great divide” has been bridged by such fantasists as Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R. Delany, and China Miéville, among others, but there remains a sense that Tolkien’s own writings are almost comically reductive with respect to morality. The Jackson films have only exacerbated this perception by reducing the nuances of the books even further, but a careful reading of Tolkien’s writings reveals a far more subtle and complicated view of the motives and goals of various characters in The Lord of the Rings and other texts. Perhaps even against his own wishes, in what might be considered a sort of political unconscious, Tolkien’s work draws attention to the troubled and troubling political and moral quandaries. Saruman is an exemplary figure in this regard. The filmmakers’ cartoonishly evil vision of Saruman is unfortunate, as it deprives a fascinating narrative of its complexity, while also being untrue to Tolkien’s own vision. Jackson and his team seem incapable of imagining that a person can be wrong without also being evil. For example, the Master of Lake-town in The Hobbit was greedy, but he was an elected official, generally well regarded by the community (at least until he absconds with the municipal funds, a fact revealed only on the last page of the book); in the film The Desolation of Smaug, he is a murderous tyrant who opposes even the idea of elections. An even worse example is the case of Denethor, Steward of Gondor, who in the books has been driven mad by grief and despair, partly owing to the cruel machinations of Sauron himself; in the film (The Return of the King), he is made so irredeemably evil that Gandalf actually attacks him, while we the viewers are expected to cheer. If this is what Jackson does to weak and pitiable characters, what must he do to Saruman, who is a legitimate “bad guy” in The Lord of the Rings? In addition to limiting his screen time, the answer seems to be: to make him both more evil and less interesting. In the original movie trilogy, Saruman is depicted strictly as a willing servant of Sauron, even going so far as to take orders from him. (Saruman’s own servants appear to acknowledge the pecking order, as one asks, “What orders from Mordor?” and “What does the Eye command?” while Saruman ponders how best to serve Sauron.) In his brief appearance in The Hobbit trilogy, he comes off as a querulous, dismissive boss, who is already shown to be subverting the council he heads. For this reason, the “Leave Sauron to me!” — uttered in response to Elrond’s insistence that they pursue the temporarily banished Sauron into Mordor — appears as a dilatory tactic that would benefit Sauron, thus revealing to the viewers (if not yet to Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond) that Saruman is already a servant of the Dark Lord. In his writings, Tolkien makes clear that Saruman was never really in league with Sauron. Saruman only feigns allegiance for a time, in order to trick Sauron into revealing secrets about the ruling ring or to stall him while Saruman himself seeks the ring. True, Saruman betrays Gandalf and the rest of the White Council, but not in order to side with the Enemy. Rather, as Gandalf himself might put it, Saruman would become Sauron. Indeed, at various points in both the film and print versions of the story, Gandalf, Galadriel, and Aragorn each reveal how powerfully tempted they are to take the ring, only to “pass the test” by declining the opportunity. Saruman is no more evil than these other characters to start with, and thus he serves as the cautionary example of what happens to the wise and good who succumb to the temptation. By missing this crucial point, the films misrepresent Tolkien’s most fascinating villain. Like Gollum, Saruman is deeply conflicted, and he is deserving of the pity he receives from Frodo and others. Saruman’s downfall is, however, more tragic than Gollum’s, since the former had so much farther to fall. Saruman’s backstory is illuminating in this regard. He was the first of the Istari or wizards to arrive in Middle-earth, and even Gandalf acknowledges him as the wisest, most powerful of that order. (Some would dispute the characterization; in an unpublished fragment, Tolkien reveals that Galadriel had wished to name Gandalf as head of the White Council, which caused Saruman to mistrust her and to envy Gandalf.) After Gandalf’s own fall in his battle with the Balrog, he is resurrected in The Two Towers as “Gandalf the White,” declaring, “I am Saruman, one might almost say.” Gandalf’s deference to Saruman early on, as well as his continuing respect for him later, should be indication enough that Saruman is not an innately evil person. Saruman’s downfall, somewhat like Sauron’s own, is based in part on his good intentions, a desire to make the world an orderly, peaceful, and rational place. In Tolkien’s mythology, both Sauron and Saruman are Maiar (angelic or demigod-like beings) who were originally in the service of Aulë, the master craftsman of the Valar, the “Powers,” in the pantheon of high gods. (Of course, there’s ultimately only one god, Eru or Ilúvatar, but let’s not get too technical here.) It is significant that the two “evil” characters in The Lord of the Rings have this association, for the connection between creativity or craftsmanship and power is, for Tolkien, a perilous one. In a famous letter describing his “private and beloved nonsense,” the materials that make up his Silmarillion, Tolkien explains that the “creative desire” can lead to the “Fall,” as the maker can become possessive, wishing to become “Lord and God of his private creation.” This leads to a desire for what Tolkien views, almost interchangeably, as Magic or the Machine, the power of “making the will more quickly effective.” With these elements, it is only a short step toward tyranny and domination, as the “sub-creator” imposes his will on others, dominating and “bulldozing” them, and hence becoming a force of “evil.” However, Tolkien explains that “this frightful evil can and does arise from an apparently good root, the desire to benefit the world and others — speedily and according to the benefactor’s own plans — is a recurrent motive.” Stepping away from Tolkien’s own philosophy for a moment, one can easily imagine a revisionist reading in which Saruman’s good intentions are vindicated, as he attempts to thwart the designs of an authoritarian, aristocratic, and preternaturally conservative regime — that of Elrond, Galadriel, and Aragorn, who are also related to each other by blood and marriage — in favor of a more progressive, modern society. In The Last Ringbearer, Kirill Yeskov’s unauthorized alternate vision of the War of the Ring, Saruman is depicted as defending the rights of an increasingly industrial civilization in Mordor against a warmongering Gandalf, who is intent on nipping the revolution in the bud. There are no orcs in this version, presumably because what Tolkien names orcs are really just men who have been demonized by their enemies. In fact, Tolkien himself gives credence to that view, as he once described the physical appearance of the orcs as resembling “the least lovely Mongol-types,” which is suggestive of a truly cultural conflict masquerading as an ethical one. Seen from this perspective, the geopolitical and moral landscape of Middle-earth looks quite different. This view of history from below informs such revisionary fantasy as we find in Delany’s Return to Nevèrÿon series, for example, and it lends color to other more complicated and interesting works of fantasy literature in recent years. However, I maintain that many elements of such perspectives, if not the authorial intent, can still be found in Tolkien’s own writings. Returning to Tolkien’s mythology, then, we can see how Saruman’s background as a skilled and wise craftsman-god helps us to understand his motives, as well as his corruption, and it also explains why Gandalf, Treebeard, and the hobbits pity him and hope to save him. The movie version of Saruman ignores his good intentions, and it also ignores his efforts to combat Sauron. By making Saruman a mere lackey of Sauron, the filmmakers vastly simplify the narrative, effectively insulting its own audience by assuming its members cannot handle multiple enemies at once or imagine conflicting values irreducible to simple “good versus evil.” (Even Harry Potter fans know that one can be bad without being evil, after all, and not because they’ve read Nietzsche, presumably.) Like Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, Saruman was never in league with Sauron, and, like them, he was always trying to undermine and ultimately defeat Sauron. Unlike those others, however, Saruman gives in to the temptation to rule, to seek a power over others to arrange things in what he takes to be their best interest. In his study of the Enemy’s “arts,” Tolkien suggests, Saruman became ensnared by this Machiavellian desire. But this is precisely why Gandalf is so eager to forgive, and even rejoin forces with, Saruman in the aftermath of the Battle of Helm’s Deep. This wise, powerful, and ultimately well-intentioned Saruman would be a most useful and worthy ally in the War of the Ring. Saruman’s story is therefore tragic. In his desire to do good, to protect the people of Middle-earth and to organize (and rule) the world according to rational, benevolent principles, Saruman succumbed to the ultimate evil, which is the desire for power, in Tolkien’s view. The ring itself is a symbol of this peril. In the films, the One Ring is given a rather different role than it had in the novels. Indeed, the filmmakers went so far as to give it a voice, albeit a barely discernible whisper, which suggests almost a personality (Sauron’s). The filmmakers also made the ring much more dangerous to wear, omitting Sam’s use of it in Cirith Ungol, for example. But Tolkien himself warned against putting too much stock in the power of the ring. As he explained in a 1958 letter to an inquisitive reader, the One Ring is a device, a mythical way of representing the truth that potency (or perhaps rather potentiality) if it is to be exercised, and produce results, has to be externalized and so as it were passes, to a greater or less degree, out of one’s direct control. A man who wishes to exert ‘power’ must have subjects, who are not himself. But he then depends on them. This explanation helps to demystify the “magic” of the One Ring, which can now be seen as a symbol for the sort of conventional machinery of political and military power, such as a standing army, police forces, or bureaucratic apparatuses. Saruman’s investigations into ring lore led him to create his own ring of power, but it was not enough to rival the One Ring, so he attempted to acquire that weapon for himself. As I suggested above, in the political landscape of Middle-earth during the War of the Ring, Saruman is really the inverted Galadriel; he “fails the test” that she passes near the end of The Fellowship of the Ring (book and film). In The Silmarillion, Galadriel’s own desire for rule and order is what led her to forsake the Undying Lands and travel to Middle-earth in the first place. Galadriel “yearned to see the wide unguarded lands and to rule there a realm at her own will.” Her motives were almost identical to Saruman’s, and even to Sauron’s originally, but she eventually — after many millennia of apparently absolute rule over her own kingdoms, by the way — abjures her own desire for power, allowing herself to “diminish […] and remain Galadriel.” Seen in this light, Saruman’s inability to “remain” Saruman is the stuff of high tragedy. This is not to say that Saruman isn’t a bad guy, only that Tolkien allows for far more nuance than his detractors imagine. Things are not nearly as black and white as many critics think, and it is a shame that the films have, by and large, gone even further in oversimplifying things. Although Gollum comes across as extremely sympathetic, a victim of the ring, other villains are presented as almost cardboard cutouts, with no depth of character at all. The filmmakers’ bizarre decision to render Sauron as a disembodied, flaming eyeball, despite the clear description of Sauron’s humanoid form in the books, is an extreme example of their unwillingness to view “bad” characters as having even a modicum of humanity. (Elsewhere, in “Let Us Now Praise Famous Orcs,” I have discussed Tolkien’s misgivings about his treatment of the orcs; as “rational, incarnate creatures,” they too must be redeemable, a fact that casts a different light on the remorseless massacres of orcs by our heroes in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.) Saruman appears as his most villainous in two scenes from the books that were either cut from the movies (“The Voice of Saruman,” which appears in the extended DVD of The Return of the King) or never filmed (“The Scouring of the Shire”), but even in those moments, Tolkien presents him as an object of pity, a once-great and noble, now “fallen” figure. It is a shame that moviegoers are not given enough credit to understand this, and that Tolkien’s greatest villain loses his tragic graces in a farcically fiendish depiction on film. Robert T.

Los Angeles Review of Books 6671 Sunset Blvd., Ste 1521 Los Angeles, CA 90028', 'The Two Towers is the second of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. The Two Towers was originally released on 11 November 1954 in the United Kingdom (3250 copies plus 1000 for the American edition). While Tolkien intended the work to be published as one volume, and believing that it was naturally divided in six ""books"", Allen and Unwin announced it would be more practical to be released in three volumes. Initially Tolkien proposed the title The Ring in the Shadow[1] and then The Shadow Lengthens.[2] The volume is divided into two books, Book III and IV, tentatively titled by Tolkien as The Treason of Isengard, and The Ring goes East[1] although these titles weren\'t used in the publication. Another abandoned title for Book IV was The Journey of the Ring-bearers.[3] While Tolkien intended the work to be published as one volume, and believing that it was naturally divided in six ""books"", Allen and Unwin decided it would be more practical to be released in three volumes and sold separately; Tolkien considered the publication in three volumes as artificial, with the widely divergent Books III and IV having to be published together.[1] Still, each of the three volumes needed its own title. By mid-1953, Tolkien was still considering various draft names, including The Ring in the Shadow[1] and The Shadow Lengthens.[2][4] The ambiguous title ""The Two Towers"" was the the best he could think. He settled on it no later than 17 August 1953, on which date he wrote to Rayner Unwin with his names for the three volumes as they would ultimately be printed.[5] At that time, the identities of the titular towers themselves were unclear in Tolkien\'s mind. In his letters[5] and sketches,[4] Tolkien considered several sets of towers, including Minas Tirith and the Barad-dûr, and even the possibility of leaving the matter ambiguous. Any pair from a set of five towers in the story could plausibly fit the title: Cirith Ungol, Orthanc, Minas Tirith, Barad-dûr, and Minas Morgul. The second part is called THE TWO TOWERS, since the events recounted in it are dominated by ORTHANC, the citadel of Saruman, and the fortress of MINAS MORGUL that guards the secret entrance to Mordor. Tolkien produced an illustration that depicts these towers for the volume\'s dust jacket. He sent it to Allen & Unwin on 23 March 1954, but it would ultimately go unused, as Tolkien and the publishers agreed to use variants of the Fellowship of the Ring illustration for the dust jackets of all three volumes.[4] The volume contains the two central ""Books"" of the wider work, tentatively titled by Tolkien as Book III: The Treason of Isengard, and Book IV: The Ring goes East[1] or The Journey of the Ring-bearers.[6] which haven\'t been used in publication. Because The Two Towers is the central portion of a longer work, its structure differs from that of a conventional novel. It begins and ends abruptly, without introduction to the characters, explanations of major plot elements or a satisfying conclusion. The first section follows the divergent paths of several important figures from The Fellowship of the Ring, but tells nothing of its central character, on whose fate so much depends, enabling the reader to share in the suspense and uncertainty of the characters themselves. The narrative of the second part returns to the hero\'s quest to destroy the evil that threatens the world. While the first section tells of an epic battle, the struggles in much of the second section are internal. Hobbits Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs who captured them when the orcs themselves are attacked by the Riders of Rohan. Merry and Pippin head into nearby Fangorn Forest where they encounter treelike giants called Ents. These guardians of the forest generally keep to themselves, but are moved to oppose the menace posed to the trees by the wizard Saruman, who has been chopping down trees in the forest to fuel fires for his furnaces. Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf, tracking Merry and Pippin, come across the riders of rohan who tell them that they attacked the orcs and left no survivors. However, Strider is able to find small prints and they follow these into Fangorn, where they meet a white wizard who they at first believe to be Saruman, but who turns out to be their wizard friend Gandalf, whom they believed had perished in the mines of Moria. He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his battle to the death with the Balrog and his reawakening. The four ride to Edoras and persuade King Théoden that his people are in danger. In the process, Saruman\'s agent in Edoras, Gríma Wormtongue, is expelled from the city. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification Helm\'s Deep while Gandalf goes north in search of Éomer\'s men in Rohan to bring as reinforcements. At Helm\'s Deep, they resist an onslaught of Orcs and Men sent by Saruman, and Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Riders of Rohan just in time. The fleeing orcs run into a forest of Huorn half-tree, half-ent creatures and none escape. Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the Rohan army then head to Saruman\'s stronghold in Isengard. There, they reunite with Merry and Pippin and find the city overrun by Ents, who have flooded it with the nearby river, and the central tower of Orthanc besieged, with Saruman in it. After giving Saruman a chance to repent, Gandalf casts him out of the order of wizards. Wormtongue throws something from a window at Gandalf and those with him. This turns out to be one of the palantíri. Pippin, unable to resist the urge, looks into it and has an encounter with Sauron. Gandalf and Pippin then head for Minas Tirith in preparation for the upcoming war. Frodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them as they try to reach Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Gollum hopes to reclaim the Ring. Sam loathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities him. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor and for a time appears to be a true ally. They first stop at the Black gate of Mordor, where Gollum persuades them not to go in, where they would have been surely caught. They head south into Ithilien, and are captured by Faramir, the brother of Boromir. Faramir learns from Frodo of his brother, with Faramir expressing his belief that Boromir is dead. Frodo tells of the plan to destroy the ring, and Faramir allows them to go on their way. Gollum leads them into the lair of Shelob, an enormous spiderlike creature, who inflicts her poisonous bite on Frodo. Sam resolves to finish the quest himself and takes the Ring. But when Orcs take Frodo\'s body, he follows them and learns that Frodo is not dead but unconscious and now their prisoner. The last line of the book is ""Frodo was alive but taken by the enemy."" A trailer for The Two Towers film interprets the title as referring to the alliance between Orthanc and Barad-dûr.[7] Some of the events of The Two Towers were depicted in a 1978 film of The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi and the 2002 The Two Towers by Peter Jackson. Both films abandoned the parallel storytelling of the book in favour of a more chronological presentation. The first chapter from the book actually appears at the end of Jackson\'s The Fellowship of the Ring. Later events of The Two Towers were filmed for Jackson\'s The Return of the King. Various games also adapt The Two Towers, including online role-playing games like The Two Towers MUD and graphically-oriented console games.']","The meaning of the title itself,' The Two Towers', was changed. While Tolkien considered several possible sets of towers he eventually created a final cover illustration and wrote a note included at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring which identified them as Minas Morgul and Orthanc. Jackson's film names them as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, symbolic of an evil alliance out to destroy Men that forms the film's plot point. The film depicted Saruman openly presenting himself outright as Sauron's servant, whereas this association was not explicitly stated in the novel (and indeed analysis by Gandalf and Aragorn in the chapter ""The White Rider"" stated that there was a rivalry instead, as Saruman was afraid of the prospect of being at war with Sauron, if Rohan and Gondor fell)."
where does the last name lee come from,"['Lee is often a common surname in English-speaking countries. Lee was the particular 35th-most-common surname inside England and Wales inside 1990s, and the 24th-most-common in the us during the season 2000 census. There are many distinct origins in the Lee surname. The most prevalent is derived from Old English lēah, that means a meadow or perhaps forest clearing. This developed variously to the surnames Lee, Lea, along with Leigh. The Lees of Shropshire (originally Gary de Lee) were notable because forebears of the particular colonial American Lee family which generated Richard Henry Lee, Robert E. Lee, and Zachary Taylor. More recently, in Britain, Gypsies have used the surnames being a homophonic translation (via ""leek"") in the Romani surname Purrum, which entails ""onion"". Meanwhile, for the majority more than a new fifth of Lees now arrived at it as China or Korean Us citizens translating numerous surnames furthermore romanized as Li, particularly the one deriving from the Chinese word pertaining to ""plum"" pinyin L; In. Kor. , Lee; S. Kor., Rhee), which has become the most common surnames on earth. In America, Lee is the most common surname for China and Korean Americans and also the second-most-common surname pertaining to Asian and Off-shore Islanders, behind the particular Vietnamese Nguyen. Also, Lee is the third-most-common surname among Chinese Singaporeans. In Gaelic-speaking parts of the British Isles, Lee, Lea, and Leigh were all used to Anglicise the occupational surname laoidhigh, that means ""poet"".

where did the saying pig in a poke come from,"['OKAY … there are three questions I’m wondering about, when it comes to British Columbians deciding on IF we change how we currently vote. And … if we do, what that new system will be. Why are we not getting an explanation of who will decide on the proportional representative going to legislature.\xa0 As it stand now, they won’t be voter elected but potentially, at least, party hacks. Right now many / most of us complain that our elected representatives DO NOT in fact represent us; instead represent the party they belong to.\xa0 Basically they do as they are told.\xa0 On the other hand, maybe they will be voter elected, perhaps by using the votes each has received, and picking the one(s) who received the most. Here’s another good one, I believe.\xa0 Question #2 Hmmmmmmmm … no answer for that either. I know, we’re supposed to trust them.\xa0 Here’s the thing though, I’m not will to make the buy, without knowing what I’m actually buying.\xa0 Really, do you go out and purchase an unknown bag of goods, when you go to the store, and then wait until you get home to see what they’ve given you? Now here’s what someone said about riding boundaries; “It is not the job of the government to change riding boundaries. The law requires an independent boundaries commission. And that process can take up to 18 months.” And they are right, of course.\xa0 It is not the government that decides this … it is, or will be, an independent commission. HERE’S THE THING THOUGH.\xa0 Any time we have had changes to riding boundaries (and they were generally jerry rigged), it was done prior to an election.\xa0 In this case, our GreeNDP government is wanting us to change how we vote, PRIOR to knowing what the boundaries will be. I’m not really very comfortable with that.\xa0 And, what’s the rush?\xa0 We’ve been voting the way we have for decades and decades; what’s one more election? There’s still too many questions, and I for one am willing to wait to have a referendum, until we have all of the answers first — or at least answers to the majority of the questions I have first. IF we all have an understanding that there WILL be a FAIR referendum on how British Columbians vote (on the future make-up of the B.C. Legislative Assembly), then we can go into the next election knowing NO party will attempt to subvert that will. The NDP … The Green Party … the BC Conservative Party … the Liberal Party.\xa0 ALL should be required to make that commitment. So, at the moment, I can safely say that I am not really warmed up to changing our First Past The Post option of voting.\xa0 That said, I am open to finding out more about the options that will be presented to us this Fall in the referendum.\xa0 That’s why I will be attending the Fair Vote Kamloops presentation with Dr. Dennis Pilon of York University, July 4 at 7 p.m., at the Clocktower Theatre at TRU.\xa0 His topic will be, “Changing B.C.’s Voting System, Arguments and Facts.” Meantime, find out everything you can, on the options available to us, and don’t be swayed, either way, by a chorus of clanging gongs.\xa0 Here’s just a few websites that will get you started: How We Vote: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018AG0041-001071 Fair Ways BC Could Vote:\xa0 https://fairvotingbc.com/join-the-campaign-for-fair-voting/fair-ways-bc-could-vote/ Vote No To PR: https://www.nobcprorep.ca/ Elections BC — 2018 Referendum: https://elections.bc.ca/referenda/ In Kamloops, I’m Alan Forseth … and I look forward to seeing your thoughts below in the Comment Section. Alan Forseth is a Kamloops resident and former member of the Reform Party of Canada and the B.C. Reform Party, and a past and current member of the BC Conservative Party. His blog is My Thoughts on Politics and More. Some form of proportional representation is used in around 94 countries in the world, including, Ireland, which has had PR since 1922!  Other countries are Norway, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium,New Zealand, Denmark. Former pm of New Zealand, Helen Clark who recently spoke in Vancouver (see her talk on youTube, said she was wary at first, but found the government got a lot done with more cooperation between the parties.  We don’t have to reinvent the wheel here in BC, and frankly, I am tired of our elected “dictatorships”. Provincially and federally. Valid questions, but not deal breakers. All the options presented guarantee local representation, exclusion of “fringe” groups, and, most importantly, inclusion of virtually every voter’s vote.  Hopefully the benefits of Proportional Representation, and the fact that we will vote on whether to keep it after we have tried it, will give you the courage to vote Yes. Thank you for a thoughtful commentary.  A few things for your consideration. The bag of goods isn’t completely unknown.  You know, for example, that it contains milk and chicken breasts, as it always does.  As always, you don’t know how MUCH milk and how MANY chicken breasts, nor do you know with any certainty that the milk doesn’t turn out to be soured, or the chicken breasts rancid.  With this new bag of goods, you can be fairly confident it will also contain bananas and potatoes, and maybe even a dessert!  Still, you won’t know the bananas aren’t blackened, the potatoes haven’t sprouted, or the dessert turned out to be ice cream that melted all over everything.  This is where you still need to hold the packer of each item to account.  Over time, the packers may come to realize it is not okay, or cost effective, to spend the next four years providing an inferior quality of goods, even with the most room in the bag. You don’t want to do this in a rush.  That is good, since this country has been talking about electoral reform and proportional representation since at least 1921.  We’ve had around 13 or 14 commissions, committee studies, citizen studies, etc. during that time, and they have ALL concluded that proportional representation is the way to go.  I’d hate to see your definition of taking it slow. But mostly, I’m surprised at the faith you have in the political party back rooms.  In spite of knowing that, today, party hacks are put into ridings where the wishes of the citizens of that riding are completely subsumed by the wishes of the party back room.  Having 100% unfettered power is difficult to voluntarily give up.  It is human nature, or at least political human nature.  But, some can look long-term and realize that 100% power today isn’t worth zero power tomorrow, even the possibility of no party status as happened recently in Ontario.  As we heard from Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, her party was against ProRep when it first came in.  But after experiencing it for 21 years, she is now a strong proponent.  Perhaps, as we learn from Samara’s exit interviews, it is because our politicians are demoralized by the realization they have been nothing more than friendly, well-intentioned puppets on a string.  I expect they’d be happier if they could have had the pride of a shopping bag better filled. Nothing has convinced me that proportional representation will be better than first past the post,  I also have a real issue with the “for” sides stance that those of us against it are ignorant, uninformed, etc etc. 2. If an MLA dies or resigns during their term in office what is the matter with a by-election held under PR rules? Isn’t it more likely that the person then elected would, through PR’s collaborative nature, represent a broader group of voters willing to contribute to consensus? 3. Isn’t the purpose of a referendum on electoral reform to decide, particularly, the answer to the referendum’s first question – ie  Do we want to stay with FPTP or switch to some form of Proportional Representation? Once decided isn’t it a reasonable assumption that all parties – NDP – – – Green – – – Conservative – – – Liberal – would commit themselves to producing the best legislation possible for the voting public, not just for their party? So, at the moment, I can safely say that I have had to live with the undemocratic nature of FPTP my entire life, have usually been unrepresented both federally and provincially, am convinced that any form of PR is far superior in representing the increasing diversity of opinion than does our present system, and realize that any new system will have to resolve some of the nitty-gritty details over the two term testing period recommended.  That’s why I will be attending the Fair Vote Kamloops presentation with Dr. Dennis Pilon of York University, July 4 at 7 p.m., at the Clocktower Theatre at TRU.  His topic will be, “Changing B.C.’s Voting System, Arguments and Facts.” Much like Mr. Forseth I seriously recommend you make this part of your research into this important issue. Certainly my foremost objection to voting for change is the naming of party hacks from a list known only to the party. Never will I ever sit still for that. All this talk of party hacks makes me think that voters don’t realize that our current system gives us closed party lists that are exactly one name long — take it or leave it. At worst, this would stay the same under PR — the names would be on the ballot and have been decided by the party. At best (and this is the most likely option, IMHO, since no one is advocating closed party lists) we would have competition among candidates from the same party. Doesn’t that sound like a breath of fresh air? Can someone explain to me how this whole “party hack” thing could possibly get worse under PR? Sorry, but your column is just more useless blather from someone that is scared of change. Grouchy is an apt name it seems.  I have indicated I am MORE THAN willing to consider change — I’m simply not willing to “buy a pig in a poke**”.  I have indicated this so far that I am indeed planing on attending the Fair Vote Kamloops presentation taking place July 4th.  The questions I have posed, and those of others, deserve to have answers.  IF we are going to change how we DEMOCRATICALLY elect our representative, it is only fair we know fully what that entails.  I think my example of buying a pig in a poke could potentially (at least) be apt given the information which is still missing. ** The idioms pig in a poke and sell a pup refer to a confidence trick originating in the Late Middle Ages, when meat was scarce, but cats and dogs were not. The scheme entailed the sale of a suckling pig in a poke. The bag, sold unopened, would actually contain a cat or dog, which was substantially less valuable as a source of meat. The French idiom acheter chat en poche refers to an actual sale of this nature, as do many European equivalents, while the English expression refers to the appearance of the trick.

what is so special about the pulmonary arteries and veins,"['The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart – it is a main function of the veins. The biggest pulmonary veins are the 4 primary pulmonary veins, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary blood circulation. The most essential function of the pulmonary veins is to bring oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, which is then pumped outward to the rest of the body. After the blood is reached other parts of the body through arteries, it loses oxygen and develops into deoxygenated blood. The body can not live and grow without oxygen; hence the pulmonary veins are of terrific significance in this field. They hold the secret to appropriate functioning of the circulatory and cardiovascular system. As part of the pulmonary blood circulation they carry oxygenated blood back to the heart, rather than the veins of the systemic blood circulation which bring deoxygenated blood. An uncommon genetic defect of the pulmonary veins can cause them to drain into the pulmonary blood circulation in entire or in part, this is referred to as a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, or partial anomalous pulmonary connection, respectively. Two primary pulmonary veins emerge from each lung hilum, getting blood from three or four bronchial veins each and draining into the left atrium. An inferior and superior mother lode drains each lung, so there are four mother lodes in total. At the root of the lung, the right remarkable pulmonary vein depends on front of and a little below the pulmonary artery; the inferior is positioned at the lowest part of the lung hilum. Behind the pulmonary artery is the bronchus. The right main pulmonary veins (includes oxygenated blood) pass behind the right atrium and superior vena cava; the left in front of the coming down thoracic aorta. Sometimes the 3 lobar veins on the right side remain separate, and not rarely the two left lobar veins end by a typical opening into the left atrium. Therefore, the variety of pulmonary veins opening into the left atrium can differ between 3 and five in the healthy population. The two left lobar veins might be unified as a single pulmonary vein in about 25% of people; the two right veins may be united in about 3%.

The term ""vein"" has diverse meanings in other contexts. In botany, vein refers to the vascular tissue of leaves, located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll, that forms a branching framework of supporting and connecting tissue. The pattern of the veins is called venation. In zoology, veins are a supporting structure in an insect wing. In geology, a vein is a finite volume within a rock, having a distinct shape, filled with crystals of one or more minerals. This article will be limited to the use of the term with reference to the circulatory system. The venal system is the lower-pressure—and normally lower oxygen-carrying—portion of the circulatory system. In the post-fetal human body, with the exception of the pulmonary vein, low oxygen blood moves from the capillaries of the arterial system to small, threadlike veins known as venules, which drain blood directly from the capillary beds, and from these the blood moves to larger and larger veins until back to the heart. The arteries are perceived as carrying oxygenated blood to the tissues, while veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This is true of the systemic circulation, by far the larger of the two circuits of blood in the body, which transports oxygen from the heart to the tissues of the body. In pulmonary circulation, however, the arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The difference between veins and arteries is their direction of flow (out of the heart by arteries, returning to the heart for veins), not their oxygen content. In addition, deoxygenated blood that is carried from the tissues back to the heart for reoxygenation in systemic circulation still carries some oxygen, though it is considerably less than that carried by the systemic arteries or pulmonary veins. Like the arteries, the veins are defined by their three-layer walls, but the vein walls are less muscular and thinner than the artery walls. Skeletal muscle contractions help move the blood through the veins. The interiors of the larger veins are occupied by periodically occurring one-way flaps called venous valves, which prevent blood from flowing backward and from pooling in the lower extremities due to the effects of gravity. In humans, valves are absent in the smallest veins and most numerous in the extremities. Excepting the pulmonary vein, veins function to return deoxygenated blood to the heart and are essentially tubes that collapse when their lumens are not filled with blood. The thick, outer-most layer of a vein is made of collagen, wrapped in bands of smooth muscle while the interior is lined with endothelial cells called intima. The precise location of veins is much more variable from person to person than that of arteries. The total capacity of the veins in humans is more than sufficient to hold the entire blood volume of the body. This capacity is reduced through the venous tone of the smooth muscles, minimizing the cross-sectional area (and hence volume) of the individual veins and therefore total venous system. The helical bands of smooth muscles that wrap around veins help maintain blood flow to the right atrium. In cases of vasovagal syncope, the most common type of fainting, the smooth muscles relax and the veins of the extremities below the heart fill up with blood, failing to return sufficient volume to maintain cardiac output and blood flow to the brain. Veins return blood from organs to the heart. In systemic circulation in human beings, oxygenated blood is pumped by the left ventricle through the arteries to the muscles and organs of the body, where nutrients and oxygen in the blood are exchanged at capillaries for cellular wastes carbon dioxide. The deoxygenated and waste-laden blood flows through the veins to the right atrium of the heart, which transfers the blood to the right ventricle, from where it is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. In pulmonary circulation the pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium, which empties into the left ventricle, completing the cycle of blood circulation. (The cellular wastes are removed primarily by the kidneys.) The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the skeletal-muscle pump, which helps maintain the extremely low blood pressure of the venous system. Fainting can be caused by failure of the skeletal-muscular pump. Long periods of standing can result in blood pooling in the legs, with blood pressure too low to return blood to the heart. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. In a functional analogy, the term ""venous"" in economics refers to recycling industries, in contrast to ""arterial"" or production industries. Veins are used medically as points of access to the blood stream, permitting the withdrawal of blood specimens (venipuncture) for testing purposes, and intravenous delivery of fluid, electrolytes, nutrition, and medications through injection with a syringe, or by inserting a catheter. In contrast to arterial blood, which is uniform throughout the body, the blood removed from veins for testing can vary in its contents depending on the part of the body the vein drains; blood drained from a working muscle will contain significantly less oxygen and glucose than blood drained from the liver. However, the more blood from different veins mixes as it returns to the heart, the more homogeneous it becomes. If an intravenous catheter has to be inserted, for most purposes this is done into a peripheral vein near the surface of the skin in the hand or arm, or less desirably, the leg. Some highly concentrated fluids or irritating medications must flow into the large central veins, which are sometimes used when peripheral access cannot be obtained. Catheters can be threaded into the superior vena cava for these uses: if long term use is thought to be needed, a more permanent access point can be inserted surgically. The most common vein disorder is venous insufficiency, usually manifested by spider veins or varicose veins. A variety of treatments are used depending on the patient\'s particular type and pattern of veins and on the physician\'s preferences. Treatment can include radio-frequency ablation, vein stripping, ambulatory phlebectomy, foam sclerotherapy, lasers, or compression. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency. Phlebology is the medical discipline that involves the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of venous origin. Diagnostic techniques used include the history and physical examination, venous imaging techniques, and laboratory evaluation related to venous thromboembolism. The American Medical Association has added phlebology to its list of Self-Designated Practice Specialties. The American College of Phlebology is a professional organization of physicians and health care professionals from a variety of backgrounds. Annual meetings are conducted to facilitate learning and sharing of knowledge regarding venous disease. The equivalent body for countries in the Pacific is the Australasian College of Phlebology, active in Australia and New Zealand. The Great Saphenous vein (GSV) is the most important superficial vein of the lower limb of humans. First described by the Persian physician Avicenna, Saphenous derives its name from Safina, meaning hidden. This vein is ""hidden"" in its own fascial compartment in the thigh and only exits the fascia near the knee. Incompetence of this vein is an important cause of varicose veins of lower limbs. The pulmonary veins carry relatively oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The superior and inferior venae cavae carry relatively deoxygenated blood from the upper and lower systemic circulations, respectively. A portal venous system is a series of veins or venules that directly connect two capillary beds. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal vein and hypophyseal portal system. Note: Some restrictions may apply to use of individual images which are separately licensed.', '', '', '', ""Circulation is the movement of substances such as nutrients and gases within blood vessels and cavities throughout the body. Not all animals have a circulatory system. Poriferans, cnidarians, platyhelminthes and nematodes (nematodes have pseudocoelom fluid but no vessels) are avascular animals. Echinoderms do not have true circulatory systems either. In animals that do not contain a circulatory system, the transport of substances occurs by cell to cell diffusion. Blood is a fundamental means of substance transport for larger animals since, in these animals, tissues are distant from each other and from the environment thus making diffusion impossible. Circulatory systems can be classified into open circulatory systems and closed circulatory systems. An open circulatory system is one in which blood does not circulate only inside blood vessels but also flows into cavities that irrigate tissues. In open circulatory systems, blood pressure is low and generally the blood (called hemolymph) has a low level of cellularity. Arthropods, molluscs (cephalopods are exception) and protochordates have open circulatory systems. A closed circulatory system is one in which blood circulates only inside blood vessels. For this reason, the blood pressure is higher in animals with closed circulatory systems. The cellularity of the blood is also higher, with many specific blood cells. Closed circulatory systems are a feature of annelids, cephalopod molluscs and vertebrates. A closed circulatory system is more efficient. Since blood circulates only inside blood vessels, it has a higher pressure and, as a result, can travel greater distances to the organs where hematosis happens and to peripheral tissues. In addition, the higher circulatory speed increases the animal’s capacity to distribute large supplies of oxygen to tissues that consume it in large amounts, such as muscle tissues, which can then perform faster movements. Animals with an open circulatory system (with the exception of insects, which carry out gas exchange separately from circulation) are generally slower and have a low metabolic rate. Cephalopod molluscs, such as octopuses and squids, have a closed circulatory system with blood pumped under pressure flowing within vessels. Bivalve molluscs, such as mussels and oysters, have an open circulatory system (also known as a lacunar circulatory system) where blood flows under low pressure, since it falls into cavities in the body and does not only circulate within blood vessels. Molluscs with closed circulatory systems are larger, agile and can actively move; molluscs with open circulatory systems are smaller, slow and some are practically sessile. In insects, the circulatory system is open but this system does not participate in the gas exchange process or in oxygen supply to tissues. Gases enter and exit through the independent tracheal system, which allows for the direct contact of cells with the\xa0ambient\xa0air. Therefore, an insect can supply the large oxygen demand of its fast-beating wing muscles even though it has an open circulatory system. Challenge your Facebook and Twitter friends. The typical components of a closed circulatory system are blood vessels within which blood circulates (arteries, veins and capillaries), a pumping organ (heart) and blood or\xa0bloodlike\xa0fluid. The heart is a muscular organ that contains chambers (right atrium and right ventricle and left atrium and left ventricle) through which blood passes. The blood enters the heart in the atria, goes to the ventricles and then leaves the organ. The blood is pumped out of the heart by the contraction of the muscle fibers that form the ventricular walls. The contraction reduces the volume of ventricle, thus increasing the internal pressure and forcing the blood to flow to the exit vessels (the pulmonary artery for the right ventricle and the aorta for the left ventricle). When ventricular muscle fibers expand, the ventricles regain their original size and receive new blood flow from the atria. Systole and diastole are the two stages into which the cardiac cycle is divided. Systole is the stage when the contraction of ventricular muscle fibers occurs and the ventricles are emptied. Diastole is the stage of the cardiac cycle when the ventricular muscle fibers expand and the ventricles are filled with blood. Arterial vessels are every blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to tissues. Arteries and arterioles are arterial vessels. Arterioles are thin arteries that end in capillaries. However, not all arteries contain arterial blood (highly oxygenated blood). The pulmonary artery and its branches, arteries that carry blood from the right heart ventricle to the lungs, contain venous blood. Venous vessels are every blood vessel that carries blood from tissues to the heart. Veins and venules are venous vessels. Venules are thin veins connected to capillaries. In general, venous vessels carry venous blood. However, the pulmonary veins that carry blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart contain arterial blood. Capillaries are small blood vessels that carry out the exchange of substances between the blood and body tissues. Capillaries are neither arteries nor veins since they have distinct features. In capillaries, the wall is made of a single layer of endothelial cells through which substances are exchanged. These vessels receive blood from arterioles and drain into venules. Only capillaries carry out the exchange of gases and other substances between tissues. The arterial system has thicker muscle walls, since within arteries blood circulates under higher pressure. Veins are more flaccid than arteries. From the lumen to the external layer, both types of vessels are made of endothelium, muscle tissue and connective tissue. The endothelium of both is made up of a single layer of cells. In arteries, the muscle tissue portion is thicker than in veins whereas, in veins, the external connective tissue is thicker than in arteries. Arteries are pulsating blood vessels. The arterial pulse can be felt during a medical examination, for example, through the palpation of the radial artery in the internal-lateral face of the wrist near the base of the thumb. The valves of the venous system are structures inside veins that make it so that blood only flows in the right direction (from tissues to the heart). preventing it from going backwards in favor of gravity. The valves close when the pressure of the fluid column above (afterwards, in terms of normal flow) is higher than the fluid pressure below them. Valves are therefore necessary for the process of blood returning to the heart. The muscles of the legs, and mainly the muscles of the calves, contract and compress the deep veins of the legs, pushing blood towards the heart. The plantar portion of the foot holds blood and, when it is pushed against the ground, \xa0it pushes its blood volume back towards the heart and therefore aids in venous return. A varix means is an abnormal enlargement of a vein. Varices occur when excessive pressure against the normal blood flow enlarges the vein and, as a result, causes its valves to stop working properly\xa0(venous insufficiency). Varices are more common in the veins of the lower limbs since the fluid column above these vessels is higher. This is the reason why people who spend a large amount of time standing (e.g., surgeons) are more likely to develop varices. In general, varices are not the superficial veins that can be seen on the legs of varix patients. These superficial veins are the result of internal varices (venous insufficiency) in the deep internal veins of the legs. These outer veins appear this way because blood flow is diverted from the internal veins to superficial ones.\xa0(However, superficial veins with this appearance are often called varices.) The lymphatic system is a network of specialized vessels with valves, which drains interstitial fluid (lymph). The lymphatic system is also responsible for the transport of chylomicrons (vesicles that contain lipids) produced after the absorption of fats by the intestinal epithelium. Along lymphatic vessels are ganglial-like structures called lymph nodes. which contain many immune system cells. These cells filter impurities and destroy microorganisms and cellular waste. The lymphatic vessels drain to two major lymphatic vessels, the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct, which in turn drain into tributary veins of the superior vena cava. The lymph nodes, or lymph glands, have lymphoid tissue that produces lymphocytes (a type of leukocyte). In inflammatory and infectious conditions, it is common to see the enlargement of lymph nodes in the lymphatic circuits that drain the affected region due to the reactive proliferation of leukocytes. This enlargement is known as lymphadenomegaly and is sometimes accompanied by pain. Checking for enlarged or painful lymph nodes is part of medical examinations since these findings may suggest inflammation, infection or other diseases. The chambers of the heart through which blood enters are the atria. There heart contains a right atrium and a left atrium. The chambers of the heart through which blood exits are the ventricles. The heart contains a right ventricle and the a ventricle. The walls of the ventricle are thicker than those of the atrium, since the ventricles are the structures responsible for the pumping of the blood to the lungs or tissues. The muscular work of the ventricles is harder and their muscle fibers are more developed. The left ventricle is more muscular than the right ventricle, because pumping blood to the lungs (the task of the right ventricle) is easier (an requires less pressure) than pumping blood to the other tissues of the body (the task of the left ventricle). The vena cava are two large veins that empty into the right atrium. The superior vena cava drains all the blood that comes from the head, the upper limbs, the neck and the upper portion of the trunk. The inferior vena cava carries blood drained from the lower portion of the trunk and the lower limbs. Venous blood circulates within the vena cava. Venous blood from tissues arrives at the right atrium of the heart. From the right atrium, the blood goes to the right ventricle. The valve that separates the right ventricle from the right atrium is the tricuspid valve (a valve system made of three leaflets). The tricuspid valve is necessary to prevent blood from returning to the right atrium during systole (the contraction of the ventricles). The valve that separates the right ventricle from the base of the pulmonary artery is the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary valve is important in preventing blood from pulmonary circulation from flowing back into the heart during diastole. Arteries of the pulmonary circulation carry venous blood and not arterial blood. When blood goes through the alveolar capillaries of the lungs, hematosis (oxygenation) occurs and carbon dioxide is released to the exterior. Pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary circulation. They are vessels that carry oxygen-rich (arterial) blood from the lungs to the heart. There are four pulmonary veins, two that drain blood from the right lung and two that drain the left lung. The pulmonary veins empty into the left atrium, supplying the heart with arterial blood. Although they are veins, they carry arterial blood and not venous blood. The arterial blood that has gone from the lungs to the left atrium then goes on to the left ventricle. The valve between the left ventricle and the left atrium is the mitral valve, a bicuspid (two leaflets) valve. The mitral valve is important because it prevents blood from flowing back into the left atrium during systole (the contraction of the ventricles). The function of the left ventricle is to receive blood from the left atrium and to pump the blood under high pressure into circulation. After leaving the left ventricle, the blood enters the aorta, the largest artery of the body. The valve between the left ventricle and the aorta is the aortic valve. The aortic valve prevents blood from flowing back into the left ventricle during diastole. In addition, as the aortic valve closes during diastole, part of the reverse blood flux is pushed through the coronary ostia (openings), holes located in the aorta wall just after the valvular insertion and which are connected to the coronary circulation, which is responsible for supplying blood to cardiac tissues. Systole is the stage of the cardiac cycle during which the ventricles contract. Therefore, the lumen of these chambers is reduced and the pressure on the blood within them is increased. During diastole, the opposite occurs. The muscle fibers of the ventricles relax and the lumen of these chambers enlarges, allowing the entrance of blood. The ventricles are filled with blood during diastole. How the human heart functions.Video by http://visiblebody.com/ The heart is made of striated cardiac muscle tissue. The heart muscle is called the myocardium and it is oxygenated and supplied with nutrients by the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries come from the base of the aorta and branch out around the heart, penetrating the myocardium. Diseases of the coronary arteries are severe conditions. The main metabolic gases transported by blood are molecular oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). Respiratory pigments are oxygen-carrying molecules present in blood. When the oxygen concentration is high, for example, in the pulmonary alveoli, respiratory pigments bind to the gas. In conditions of low oxygen concentration, such as in tissues, the respiratory pigments release the molecule. The respiratory pigment of human blood is hemoglobin, which is present within red blood cells. Oxygen-bound hemoglobin is called oxyhemoglobin. In the lungs, the oxygen concentration is higher and, as a result, there is a higher concentration of oxyhemoglobin . In peripheral tissues, the situation is the reverse, as the concentration of oxygen is lower and there is more free hemoglobin. Hemoglobin F is the hemoglobin found in the fetus of mammals whereas hemoglobin A is normal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin F has a greater affinity to bind to oxygen. The fetus needs hemoglobin capable of extracting oxygen from the mother’s blood. Therefore, the fetus uses hemoglobin F since it has greater affinity for oxygen than the mother’s hemoglobin. At high altitudes, the air has lower pressure and the concentration of oxygen is lower than at low altitudes. In this situation, the efficiency of the respiratory system must be greater and therefore the body synthesizes more hemoglobin (and more red blood cells) in an attempt to obtain more oxygen. This phenomenon is known as compensatory hyperglobulinemia. Compensatory hyperglobulinemia is the reason why athletes who will compete at high altitudes need to arrive there a few days before the event so that there is time for their body to make more red blood cells, thus allowing them to be less affected by the effects of the low atmospheric oxygen concentration (fatigue, reduced muscular strength). The substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow is erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is a hormone secreted by the kidneys. Its secretion is increased when there is a deficiency in tissue oxygenation (tissue hypoxia) caused by either\xa0reduced oxygen availability (as is the case at high altitudes) or by internal diseases, such as pulmonary diseases. Hemoglobin “likes” carbon monoxide (CO) much more than it likes oxygen. When carbon monoxide is present in the inhaled air, it binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin by occupying the binding site where oxygen would normally bind. Due hemoglobin's greater affinity for carbon monoxide (for example, in intoxication from car exhaust) there is no transportation of oxygen and the individual undergoes hypoxia, loses consciousness, inhales more carbon monoxide and may even die. Intoxication by carbon monoxide is an important cause of death in fires and closed garages. In aerobic cellular respiration, the release of carbon dioxide happens during the transformation of pyruvic acid into acetyl-CoA (two molecules) and during the Krebs cycle (four molecules). For each glucose molecule, six carbon dioxide molecules are produced. In vertebrates, almost 70% of this carbon dioxide is transported by the blood in the form of bicarbonate, 25% is bound to hemoglobin, and 5% dissolved in the plasma. Double closed circulation, or closed circulation, is that when blood circulates through two associated and parallel vascular systems: one that carries blood to peripheral tissues and transports aways from them (systemic circulation) and another that carries blood to the tissues that perform gas exchange with the environment (pulmonary circulation) and then transport this blood way from them. Double circulation occurs in amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Simple closed circulation, or simple circulation, is when the tissues that perform gas exchange are connected in series to the systemic circulation, such as in fish. The fish heart is a tube made of two consecutive chambers: one atrium and one ventricle. The venous blood from tissues enters the atrium and goes on to the ventricle, which then pumps the blood towards the gills. After oxygenation in the gills, the arterial blood goes to the tissues. Therefore, the fish heart pumps venous blood. Complete circulation is when there is no mixture of venous and arterial blood. Simple circulation is when blood circulates only in one circuit (as opposed to double circulation, which contains two circuits, the systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation). In fish, the circulatory system is simple and complete. The amphibian heart has three heart chambers: two atria and one ventricle. Amphibian circulation is double because it consists of systemic and pulmonary circulation: that is, heart-tissues-heart and heart-lungs-heart, respectively. Since amphibians have only one ventricle in their heart, venous blood taken from the tissues and arterial blood coming from the lungs are mixed in the ventricle, which then pumps the mixture back into systemic and pulmonary circulations. Amphibian circulation is considered incomplete because venous and arterial blood mix in the circuit. Blood oxygenation in amphibians also occurs\xa0in systemic circulation, since their skin is a gas exchange organ. Reptiles also have double and incomplete circulation, with a heart that contains three chambers (two atria and one ventricle). However, the reptile heart presents the beginning of a ventricular septation that partially separates the right and left region of the chamber. With this partial ventricular septation, there is less mixture of arterial with venous blood among reptiles than among amphibians. Bird and mammal hearts are divided into four chambers: the right atrium, the right ventricle, the left atrium and the left ventricle. Birds and mammals are homeothermic, meaning that they control their body temperature. Their four-chambered heart and double circulation provide tissues with more oxygenated blood, making a higher metabolic rate possible (mainly cellular respiration rate). Part of the energy produced by cellular respiration is used to maintain body temperature. In human fetal circulation, there are two points at which arterial and venous blood are mixed, which characterizes this as an incomplete circulation. One of them is the oval foramen, an opening between the right and the left atria of the fetal heart. The other is the arterial duct, a short vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta. These points close a few days after birth and as a result are not present in the adult heart. Heart contraction is independent from neural stimulus (although it can be regulated by the autonomous nervous system). The heart contains pacemaker cells that independently trigger the action potentials that begin muscle contraction. These cells are concentrated at two special points in the heart: the sinoatrial node (SA node), located in the upper portion of the right atrium, and the atrioventricular node (AV node), located near the interatrial septum. The action potentials generated by the depolarization of SA node cells propagate from cell to cell throughout the atria, producing the atrial contraction. The atrial depolarization also propagates to the AV node, which then transmits the electric impulse to the ventricles through specialized conduction bundles of the interventricular septum (the bundle of His) and then to the Purkinje fibers of the ventricle walls, causing a ventricular contraction. (Atrial contraction precedes ventricular contraction so that blood fills the ventricles before ventricular contraction.) The repolarization of the SA node makes the atria relax, with the ventricles relaxing afterwards. Give access to Biology Q&As to someone you like.

Vein disease occurs when veins have trouble carrying blood from your body back to your heart. The main cause is heredity. You are at higher than average risk if your mother or grandmother — or even someone on your father’s side — suffers from serious vein problems. Also, due to pregnancy, women are more often affected than men. Symptoms of vein disease may seem harmless at first but can develop into serious problems if left untreated. In the beginning, many people experience leg “heaviness”, which is sometimes disregarded and attributed to stress or exhaustion. However, experiencing continual “heaviness” should be taken seriously. Other symptoms include pain or tenderness along the course of a vein, itching or burning sensations and “restless” leg syndrome, typically occurring at night as the muscles tend to contract to push blood back toward the heart. Aching, swelling, muscle cramps, exercise intolerance, bulging veins, blue veins and enlarged veins are other symptoms that can occur. Patients typically experience relief of symptoms when walking or elevating their legs. Even though these symptoms can sometimes be tolerated or brushed off, they should be taken seriously. They can progressively get worse and turn into bigger problems if treatment is not sought. If you experience any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. You may also want to consider being evaluated by a vein specialist. For more information on varicose veins and treatment options visit www.renoveinclinic.com. Spider veins can cause discomfort and embarrassment. Fortunately, there are many treatment options that can improve appearances. Spider vein treatments are designed to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications or improve the appearance of spider veins. There are four popular treatment options available today. Compression socks are a good option for individuals that want to reduce leg pain, although they can’t improve appearance. Laser treatments, surgery and sclerotherapy all improve symptoms and appearance. Usually, sclerotherapy is the best option because it has the lowest risk and the least amount of pain. Compression stockings are the most affordable spider vein treatment available. These stockings put pressure on the veins in the legs and can alleviate pain and discomfort. There are three types of stockings available. Support pantyhose offer little pressure and cannot apply pressure to a specific area. A family physician may use surface laser treatments to treat spider veins. This procedure uses strong bursts of light that are sent throughout the skin. This causes veins to slowly fade, although the process can be very painful even though no needles or incisions are made. Laser treatments do not work for everyone because the laser only works with certain skin types and shades. It’s possible for a single spider vein to require up to five separate treatments and veins larger than 3mm cannot be treated with a laser. Potential side effects include swollen skin and discoloration that can last for months. Surgery is the most invasive spider vein treatment available and is reserved for large veins. This procedure involves tying veins shut or removing them completely with small incisions. Although it doesn’t affect circulation, surgery can be hard to recover from and involves many risks. The recovery takes up to a month and pain can last for many weeks. Permanent scars, infection and nerve tissue damage are possible risks of the surgery. By far the most common spider vein treatment is a procedure called sclerotherapy. This treatment usually takes place in the office of a family physician. The doctor will inject a very small amount of liquid chemical into the spider vein, which causes it to swell and then stick together and seal. This stops the flow of blood through the vein and it turns to scar tissue. Within weeks the appearance usually fades completely. No anesthesia is required, although two or three treatments may be necessary for stubborn veins. Compression socks are usually worn afterwards to reduce swelling.

Blood vessels are part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the body. There are three major types of blood vessels. 1. Arteries Arteries carry blood away from the heart. Both arteries and veins have the same structure with three layers: tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia. The largest artery is the aorta, which carries blood out of the heart. 2. Capillaries Capillaries enable the exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and tissues. Capillaries consist of a layer of endothelium and occasional connective tissue. Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels. 3. Veins Veins carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. Veins are either arterial or venous, depending on whether the blood in it is flowing away from (arterial) or toward (venous) the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart except for the pulmonary and umbilical veins. Veins are classified in a number of ways. Superficial veins are those that are close to the surface of the body and have no corresponding arteries. Deep veins are deeper in the body and have corresponding arteries. Pulmonary veins are a set of veins that deliver oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. Systemic veins drain the tissues of the body and deliver deoxygenated blood to the heart.']","The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The largest pulmonary veins are the four main pulmonary veins, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary circulation."

Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Spanish Partido Revolucionario Institucional,  Mexican political party that dominated the country’s political institutions from its founding in 1929 until the end of the 20th century. Virtually all important figures in Mexican national and local politics belonged to the party, because the nomination of its candidate to a public office was almost always tantamount to election. Originally called the National Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Nacional), the party was renamed the Mexican Revolutionary Party (Partido de la Revolución Mexicana) in 1938 and took its current name, Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional; PRI), in 1946. The PRI was founded by former president Plutarco Elías Calles and his followers in a period of conflict with the Roman Catholic Church, rebellion in the military, and disputes with the United States. In effect, the party represented the institutionalization of the new power structure that had emerged as a result of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), a coalition of regional and local political-military bosses and labour and peasant leaders. This governing coalition sought a more conservative evolution (though often under “revolutionary” guises) and more stability in government. In the new party-state system that emerged, party control came to be concentrated in the Central Executive Committee, whose chief was selected by the president of Mexico and entrusted with the task of approving party nominees for all important elective positions in Mexico except for the presidency. The incumbent president, who under the Mexican constitution could serve only one term, selected his own successor. The Central Executive Committee became responsible for enforcing a common understanding among state and national officials and among the various groups within the party. The PRI’s establishment shifted power from political-military chieftains to state party units and to those sectors of the party representing peasants, urban labourers, and the military. President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–40) enhanced the authority of the peasant wing of the party and balanced the existing party sectors with a so-called popular sector representing such disparate groups as civil servants, the professions, small businessmen, small farmers, artisans, youth, and women. The Cárdenas-led PRI government also granted asylum to Soviet revolutionary Leon Trotsky. In the early 1940s the party’s military wing was disbanded, and its members were encouraged to join the popular sector, which became the largest in the party. Under Cárdenas’s party reforms, the PRI established a large patronage system that doled out benefits to various groups in return for political support. Cárdenas also attracted support for the party by introducing land reform and nationalizing the oil industry (1930). Although the PRI could count on the enthusiastic support of large segments of the population, when necessary it used repression and, according to its critics, electoral fraud to solidify its position. For example, it violently suppressed student protests in the 1970s and was accused of rigging several elections in the 1980s and ’90s. In the late 1970s the party’s political monopoly was seriously challenged when opposition parties gained a few seats in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Mexico’s legislature. The PRI remained in the majority but continued to lose congressional seats in later elections. In 1988 opposition candidates won 4 of the 64 Senate seats—the first time in 59 years that the PRI conceded losing any Senate election; and in that year’s presidential election the victory of the PRI’s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was by the narrowest margin ever and aroused allegations from all of the country’s opposition groups that the party had resorted to fraud to maintain the presidency. Consequently, Salinas introduced electoral reforms, dismissed by some opposition groups as too timid, and dissidents within the PRI began to campaign for greater intraparty democracy; in particular, some within the PRI wanted to radically alter the candidate-selection process to remove absolute power from a handful of party elites. In 1989 the PRI lost the gubernatorial election in Baja California Norte—its first gubernatorial loss ever. Several states elected non-PRI governors in the mid- and late 1990s, and in 1997 a non-PRI candidate captured the mayoralty of Mexico City. In addition to electoral reforms, Salinas introduced far-reaching economic reforms that liberalized the economy and privatized some state firms (e.g., the Mexican banks), and he negotiated a free-trade pact with the United States and Canada. Salinas’s government also passed legislation that reformed the education and agriculture systems and granted legal recognition to the Roman Catholic church (which had been stripped of its status in 1917). In 1994 Salinas’s hand-picked successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, was assassinated while campaigning, and the party subsequently chose as its presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo, a cabinet secretary who had helped balance Mexico’s budget and improve the country’s literacy rate during the 1990s. Although Zedillo won comfortably, his margin of victory was the narrowest ever for the PRI in a presidential election. Zedillo instituted several reforms designed to end political corruption and promote freer elections. In the midterm elections of Zedillo’s term, the PRI was unable to retain a majority in the House of Deputies for the first time. In 1999 Zedillo broke from tradition by refusing to nominate a successor. Subsequently, the PRI held its first presidential primary, which critics decried as fraudulent. In 2000 Francisco Labastida, the PRI’s candidate, was defeated for the presidency by Vicente Fox of the National Action Party (PAN). Zedillo left office later that year, ending the PRI’s 71-year period of continuous rule. However, the party retained control of numerous state and local governments and continued to be a major force in both chambers of the national legislature. In the country’s July 2009 midterm elections, the PRI made a comeback, winning the most seats in the House of Deputies. In 2012 the party regained the presidency with the election of Enrique Peña Nieto. In the 2018 national election, however, the PRI’s presidential candidate finished a distant third and the party’s representation in both houses of Congress plummeted.', 'The Communist Party of China (CPC), also referred to as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is the founding and ruling political party of the People\'s Republic of China.

The center of Mexico is a great, high plateau, open to the north, with mountain chains on the east and west and with ocean-front lowlands lying outside them. Federal republic. At least three great civilizations—the Mayas, the Olmecs, and later the Toltecs—preceded the wealthy Aztec Empire, conquered in 1519–1521 by the Spanish under Hernando Cortés. Spain ruled Mexico as part of the viceroyalty of New Spain for the next 300 years until Sept. 16, 1810, when the Mexicans first revolted. They won independence in 1821. From 1821 to 1877, there were two emperors, several dictators, and enough presidents and provisional executives to make a new government on the average of every nine months. Mexico lost Texas (1836), and after defeat in the war with the U.S. (1846–1848), it lost the area that is now California, Nevada, and Utah, most of Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In 1855, the Indian patriot Benito Juárez began a series of reforms, including the disestablishment of the Catholic Church, which owned vast property. The subsequent civil war was interrupted by the French invasion of Mexico (1861) and the crowning of Maximilian of Austria as emperor (1864). He was overthrown and executed by forces under Juárez, who again became president in 1867. The years after the fall of the dictator Porfirio Diaz (1877–1880 and 1884–1911) were marked by bloody political-military strife and trouble with the U.S., culminating in the punitive U.S. expedition into northern Mexico (1916–1917) in unsuccessful pursuit of the revolutionary Pancho Villa. Since a brief civil war in 1920, Mexico has enjoyed a period of gradual agricultural, political, and social reforms. The Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR; National Revolutionary Party), dominated by revolutionary and reformist politicians from northern Mexico, was established in 1929; it continued to control Mexico throughout the 20th century and was renamed the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI; Institutional Revolutionary Party) in 1946. Relations with the U.S. were disturbed in 1938 when all foreign oil wells were expropriated, but a compensation agreement was reached in 1941. Following World War II, the government emphasized economic growth. During the mid-1970s, under the leadership of President José López Portillo, Mexico became a major petroleum producer. By the end of Portillo's term, however, Mexico had accumulated a huge external debt because of the government's unrestrained borrowing on the strength of its petroleum revenues. The collapse of oil prices in 1986 cut Mexico's export earnings. In Jan. 1994, Mexico joined Canada and the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which will phase out all tariffs over a 15-year period, and in Jan. 1996, it became a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1995, the U.S. agreed to prevent the collapse of Mexico's private banks. In return, the U.S. won virtual veto power over much of Mexico's economic policy. In 1997, in what observers called the freest elections in Mexico's history, the PRI lost control of the lower legislative house and the mayoralty of Mexico City in a stunning upset. To increase democracy, President Ernesto Zedillo said in 1999 that he would break precedent and not personally choose the next PRI presidential nominee. Several months later, Mexico held its first presidential primary, which was won by former interior secretary Francisco Labastida, Zedillo's closest ally among the candidates. In elections held on July 2, 2000, the PRI lost the presidency, ending 71 years of one-party rule. Vicente Fox Quesada, of the conservative National Action Party (PAN), took 43% of the vote to Labastida's 36%. Fox vowed tax reform, an overhaul of the legal system, and a reduction in power of the central government. By 2002, however, Fox had made little headway on his ambitious reform agenda. Disfavor with Fox was evident in 2003 parliamentary elections, when the PRI rebounded, winning 224 of the 500 seats in the lower house. After the elections, Fox admitted publicly that many Mexicans were disappointed with his government thus far. In 2004, a two-year investigation into the “dirty war,” which Mexico's authoritarian government waged against its opponents in the 1960s and 1970s, led to an indictment—later dropped—against former president Luis Echeverria for ordering the 1971 shooting of student protesters. An attempt to bring criminal charges against Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the enormously popular leftist mayor of Mexico City, were dropped in May 2005 after a huge public rally in favor of the mayor took place. López Obrador was accused of a technical offense, breaching a court order involving the construction of an access road in the city, which could have blocked his intended run for the presidency in 2006. Many believe that the charges were politically motivated, so that López Obrador could not run against the deeply unpopular incumbent, Vicente Fox. See also Mexico.

This error was generated by Mod_Security.', 'The middle of the 20th century, after World War II, saw many regional conflicts resulting from the Cold War between freedom in the United States and communism in the Soviet Union.  Eventually freedom prevailed, but there is much history to be learned about how it prevailed.  Also, there were many independence movements in the 20th century. Americans feared a “domino effect” of communism for good reason.  Imagine a row of dominoes, and what happens when one falls into another, then into another, and so on.  Each falling domino can knock over the one next to it.  Americans starting with President Dwight Eisenhower feared that effect when communism took over a nation:  all nearby nations could be the next to fall to that same communism. Southeast Asia has a large population, and after World War II the region was vulnerable to a spread of communism from the Soviet Union and China.  An independence movement beginning in the 1930s caused the French to leave, and Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh was a nationalist leader who received aid from the communists.  The French imposed a death sentence on Ho Chi Minh; however, he fled to avoid this punishment.  When he returned in 1941, he founded “Vietminh”, with the name reflecting that he intended to rule as a dictator.  Japan interrupted his plan by taking control of the region during World War II, but in 1945 the Vietminh defeated the Japanese.  That demonstrated how tough the Vietnamese fighters were, because the Japanese were invincible against China and many other opponents.  Ho Chi Minh then declared the independence of a new Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a huge communist country that has 84 million people today. The French tried unsuccessfully to regain control of Vietnam after World War II.  In 1954, the communist Vietnamese nationalists defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu and the French surrendered to Ho Chi Minh.  The French then agreed to divide Vietnam at the 17th parallel,[1] as part of the Geneva Conference.  North Vietnam would be communist under Ho Chi Minh, while South Vietnam would be free under Ngo Dinh Diem. Ho Chi Minh was popular in both North and South Vietnam, and gave away land to the people in order to boost his popularity.  Ngo Dinh Diem was unpopular, and the United States feared that an election in the South might choose Ho Chi Minh’s communists.  So elections were postponed, but the conditions worsened.  The Vietcong, who were communist guerrillas in the South, formed and began causing problems in the early 1960s.  In 1963, South Vietnamese generals who had received support from the United States took over South Vietnam, and the generals shockingly assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem. The United States began sending military advisers and weapons to prevent a takeover of the South by the Vietcong.  In August 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson faced reelection, there were mysterious gunshots fired at an American ship in the Gulf of Tonkin near North Vietnam.  It was later disputed whether this was an actual attack on Americans.  Johnson, wanting a war to boost his popularity and reelection chances, pushed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution through Congress to authorize sending troops.  A formal declaration of war never occurred, but this Resolution served as a substitute.  Within a year, thousands of American 19-year-olds were sent to fight the communists in Vietnam. The Soviet Union, China and North Vietnam responded by sending their own troops and weapons to help the Vietcong.  The United States bombed North Vietnam, and also bombed targets in South Vietnam to hit Vietcong hideouts.  But the Vietcong were hard to find, and knew the jungle much better than the Americans did.  The Vietcong planted land mines throughout the country, causing thousands of American soldiers to die or lose their limbs merely by taking a tragically wrong step. The conflict in Vietnam helped President Johnson win reelection in 1964, but by 1968 Americans (particularly Democrats in Johnson\'s own political party) had tired of the tens of thousands of American deaths.  President Johnson did embarrassingly poorly in the first presidential primary (New Hampsire), and had to withdraw from the race for reelection.  As with many wars, including the war in Iraq from 2003 to the present, public support for the war starts very high but tends to decline over time. When President Nixon arrived at the White House after the 1968 elections, he embraced “Vietnamization” as a policy for slowly withdrawing American troops from South Vietnam, hoping that the South Vietnamese would do more themselves in fighting communism.  Nixon also increased bombing of North Vietnam and Vietcong strongholds in Cambodia and Laos. Nixon was heavily influenced by his adviser Henry Kissinger.  Kissinger’s approach towards Vietnam was to launch bombing attacks and then look like a hero in declaring cease-fires.  He did this repeatedly and received much praise by newspapers for it.  But the communists would simply re-supply their guerrilla fighters during the cease-fires, and so the cease-fires actually helped the communists continue the war.  (A ""guerrilla"" is someone who fights aggressively in an unorganized, irregular manner using surprise, deception and sabotage.)  By 1973, the United States gave up and pulled the last American soldiers out.  A million Vietnamese then fled South Vietnam to escape the communists, who took over by 1975.  The United States imposed a trade embargo on the newly unified Vietnam that lasted until 1994.  President Bush visited Vietnam in 2006. Things worsened further in next-door Cambodia after the Americans left Vietnam.  Pol Pot took over Cambodia in 1975, and he abolished private property, money and religion, and converted everything back to an agricultural society.  He emptied the cities.  His ruthless policies possibly resulted in the death of 1-2 million Cambodians in the late 1970s.  The Hollywood movie about his dictatorship, The Killing Fields, exposed his atrocities and perhaps exaggerated them as a way of blaming the United States, which once supported Pol Pot as a counterweight to Vietnam.  Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge government fell in 1979 when Vietnam invaded Cambodia after a series of violent border confrontations, and Pol Pot fled to the northern jungle with his forces.  He died from illness in 1998.  Today there are United Nations peacekeeping forces in Cambodia. In connection with the “Third World”[2] of Latin America, Africa, and many parts of Asia, the Cold War became a battle for influence over the system of government adopted by any and every small country.  It seemed like there were only two choices:  communist or free (capitalist).  Both the United States and Soviet Union would compete with each other to provide to developing nations aid, military advisers, social workers (e.g., the Peace Corps from the United States), educational programs and technology. This drama has been playing out in Latin America ever since World War II, and remains an issue even now.  In the 1950s, the United States supported Fulgencio Batista as dictator of Cuba, but Fidel Castro overthrew him in 1959.  Liberals in the United States promoted Castro as a hero, and he was welcomed to talk at American colleges.  But just as conservatives predicted, Castro became a ruthless communist dictator who brutally suppressed all opposition and ended free speech and free enterprise on the island of Cuba.  Castro seized private industries, such as the thriving sugar refineries, and predictably the Cuban economy collapsed.  Cuba fell from being one of the most prosperous nations to one of the poorest.  Today most Cubans cannot even afford to own an automobile. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba and the Soviet Union provided it with aid, which was a typical pattern in this Cold War between the two superpowers.  Cubans who had fled to Florida from the island arranged for an invasion of Cuba in April 1961 to overthrow Castro.  President John F. Kennedy withheld support at the last minute and someone in his Administration probably leaked the plans to Castro, who was then waiting for it and slaughtered the invaders at the Bay of Pigs.  President Kennedy allowed the United States to be humiliated by this. Strengthened, Castro became more aggressive and in 1962 began to install Soviet missiles to point them directly at the United States.  President Kennedy ordered a blockade of Cuba to prevent installation of additional missiles, and a top American general put his bombers into combat mode.  This demonstrated a readiness to go to war (“brinkmanship”) and the Soviet leader Khrushchev then backed down.  Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles when the United States agreed not to invade Cuba. But Cuba continued to grow closer politically to the Soviet Union, which funded its failing economy.  In the 1970s Cuba sent 50,000 soldiers to help communism in Angola, and Cuba remained there until 1988.  When communism itself fell in the Soviet Union in 1991 and it broke up, Cuba lost its funding.  It became even poorer, dropping to desperate levels of poverty throughout the nation. Communism in Latin America was not limited to Cuba.  In Nicaragua, communist rebels named the Sandinistas overthrew an American-backed ruler named Anastasio Somoza.  The United States then supported the anti-communist Contras in the 1980s.  In 1990, the Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega finally agreed to hold free elections in order to end the civil war, and he was defeated by the pro-American Violeta Chamorro.  But in 1997 Arnoldo Alemán was elected as the Nicaraguan leader. Although supposedly not a communist, he formed a pact with the Sandinistas against his own Liberal Constitutionalist Party, and near the end of 2006 Daniel Ortega completed a successful comeback by being elected as president based on his claim that he is not a communist anymore.  He won with only about 38% of the vote, benefiting from a change in rules that no longer requires at least 45% of the vote to win. The poverty in many countries in Latin America may help explain why communism is more popular there.  In Nicaragua, one of the poorest nations in Latin America, 46% of the population lived on less than $386 in income for the entire year of 2001.  Not only is a job hard to find, but electricity and drinking water are not always available either. Poverty alone cannot explain the popularity of communism. In oil-rich Venezuela, the people reelected the communist Hugo Chavez in December 2006, and he spread communism to other nations there.  Young and intimidating, Chavez was described as \'Castro with money.\'  In April 2009, he and President Barack Obama shook hands with enthusiasm for the cameras.  But Chavez\'s insistence on communism was his downfall, because he developed prostate cancer and the inadequate communist health care system was unable to save him (American health care probably could have).  Chavez died in 2013 at the age of only 59. The Cold War did not explain every conflict in the 20th century.  For example, the Cold War did not explain the conflicts in the Middle East (Southwest Asia), where Islam is the dominant force.  The United States helped build oil wells in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab countries, but the Shiite Muslims disapprove of the American presence. In 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew King Farouk of Egypt.  Nasser modernized Egypt’s economy and military, seeking to build a nation that could assert its power in the Middle East. In 1956, Nasser seized the Suez Canal from the French and British companies that controlled it.  His plan was to nationalize the canal to raise money to build the Aswan Dam, and needed cash after the Americans and British withdrew a pledge to help fund it.  Nasser’s seizure of the Suez Canal created the “Suez Crisis” for a week because many nations, including Israel, relied on the Canal for shipping.  The British and French provided air support for an invasion by Israeli troops, which easily overcame Egyptian resistance.  But then the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on behalf of Egypt, creating a risk of a world war.  Nasser was allowed to keep the canal, and international pressure by the United States caused Britain, France and Israel to back off. In Iran, the United States supported the pro-West Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (“Shah of Iran”) against a revolt in 1953.  For 25 years the Shiite Muslim leaders in Iran, also known as “ayatollahs”, opposed the Shah.  In 1978, the Shiites revolted and caused the Shah to flee, and in 1979 he sought admission to the United States for medical treatment.  The Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini took control of Iran. Henry Kissinger, whose friends and business clients probably included supporters of the Shah, persuaded President Jimmy Carter to admit the Shah to the United States to treat his illness. Carter granted the Shah admission, and student Shiites in Iran angrily responded by taking 69 Americans hostage at the U.S. embassy in Tehran.  They demanded that the Shah be returned to Iran, but Carter refused.  The Shiites did not release their 55 American hostages until Carter was replaced by Ronald Reagan as president on Jan. 20, 1981. In 1980, the Sunni Iraq leader Saddam Hussein sought to conquer neighboring Iran.  Iraq and Iran fought a fierce battle for nearly a decade without a victory by either side. In 1979, Muslims in Afghanistan (in Southwest Asia) revolted against the Soviet-friendly communist government there.  The Soviets responded by invading Afghanistan and attempting to suppress the revolution.  The United States reacted to this Soviet invasion by boycotting the summer Olympic Games in Moscow and providing arms to the Afghan rebels.  The Soviets struggled for a decade in Afghanistan, much as the United States had struggled in Vietnam, and the Soviets eventually withdrew from the country.  In many ways, Islam is a more powerful ideology than communism, and in this case Islam did defeat communism in Afghanistan.  But some communists claim to be Christians, there are also some communist (or socialist) Muslims. Stalin died in 1953, and Nikita Khrushchev replaced him as the dictator over the Soviet Union.  Khrushchev was an aggressive leader who had brutally carried out Stalin’s policies while Stalin was alive, but then denounced Stalin as soon as he died and tried to purge all memory of Stalin (“de-Stalinization”).  However, Khrushchev was nearly as evil as Stalin was.  Khrushchev viciously repressed a freedom movement in Hungary in October 1956.  He ordered an invasion with Soviet tanks and arranged for the execution of the Hungarian leader Imre Nagy, who sought to hold free elections.  Khrushchev replaced him with a pro-Soviet puppet (a ""puppet"" in politics is someone who is controlled in his political decisions by someone else).  Thousands of Hungarian “freedom fighters” were slaughtered by the Soviets, and the Hungarian religious leader Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty (a high-ranking clergyman in the Catholic Church) fled to the United States embassy to survive.  (A country\'s embassy is considered part of that country, and even though it is located in another nation the authorities in the other nation are not allowed to go inside without permission.)  The communist dictatorship installed by the Soviets prevented him from stepping foot outside of the embassy building for the next 15 years.  Imagine never once leaving your home for 15 years! Khrushchev also ordered the building of the Berlin Wall and the placement of missiles in Cuba, which led to the Cuban Missile Crisis.  But Khrushchev’s confrontational personality was too much even for his fellow communists, as he would often interrupt speeches by others and act in other unpredictable ways.  Khrushchev could not get along with China, even though both were communist countries.  In 1960, Khrushchev stopped sharing atomic bomb secrets with China, and later there was even a little violence along their long border. While Khrushchev was on vacation in 1964 a group led by Leonid Brezhnev arranged to strip him of power.  The group persuaded the Politburo, which governed the Communist Party, to replace Khrushchev with Brezhnev.  Khrushchev then lived out the remainder of life under the watch of the Soviet KGB, but he did manage to smuggle out his memoirs for publication in the West. Brezhnev ruled as brutally as Khrushchev had, though with less personal confrontation.  When Czechoslovakian leader Alexander Dubcek allowed greater freedom of speech in his country in 1968, the Soviets responded by invading with tanks just as they had in Hungary over a decade earlier. President Nixon sought to take advantage of the icy relationship between the Soviet Union and China, and also to open up China to American businessmen.  Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai began to end China’s isolation from the rest of the world by inviting a U.S. table tennis team to tour China in 1971.  President Nixon then stunned the world and his conservative supporters, who opposed communism, by supporting membership in the United Nations for Communist China (the “People’s Republic of China”). In 1972, President Nixon became the first American president to travel to Communist China.  By 1979, there were diplomatic relations between the United States and China. Also in 1972, Nixon traveled to the Soviet Union and signed an arms agreement with the Soviet Union to reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons.  This agreement was “SALT I,” representing the “Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.”  These apparently friendly dealings between the archenemies United States and the Soviet Union were described with the French word of “détente” (relaxation in tension between nations).  For centuries French was the language of diplomacy in Europe and its vocabulary offered the best terms. SALT I limited the United States and Soviet Union to their 1972 levels of intercontinental ballistic missiles.  In 1975, the two nations signed another arms reduction agreement known as the Helsinki Accords, and this was joined by 35 other nations.  The American presidency had changed from Nixon to Gerald Ford by 1975, but in practice the Administration was still being run by Henry Kissinger and his view of world government and relations.  Conservatives criticized both treaties as hurting the United States, emphasizing that there was no way to enforce the treaty against the Soviet Union. President Jimmy Carter continued the trend by signing SALT II in 1979, which would have provided for further reductions.  In a victory for conservatives, the U.S. Senate refused to ratify that treaty.  At one point, President Carter told the American people that his 12-year-old daughter was upset about the growing problem of “nuclear proliferation,” by which many other nations such as India and Pakistan acquired atomic bombs.  Many thought Carter\'s reasoning was silly. In November 1980, the first modern conservative was elected president of the United States:  Ronald Reagan.  President Reagan cut taxes, defeated communism, and promoted the most original and influential idea of any president in all of American history:  the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or “Star Wars.”  This was a plan to use advantaged technology to intercept and destroy, in mid-air, fast-moving missiles that might be launched against the United States. Reagan’s critics ridiculed SDI as impossible and dangerous.  But those criticisms were somewhat contradictory with each other; it was precisely because SDI might be possible that it was so beneficial.  The Soviet Union, then led by Mikhail Gorbachev, panicked.  Gorbachev met with Reagan at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1986 in which Gorbachev promised almost anything if Reagan would agree to drop SDI.  The media pressure was intense for Reagan to agree.  But Reagan stood up for America. He shook his head and he said “no deal.”  The next year Reagan made a trip to the Berlin Wall, against the recommendation of his advisers, and declared to the world, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”  Remarkably, two years later the Germans did exactly that, and tore down the Berlin Wall built by the communists.  Although Reagan and Gorbachev did sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 1987, which banned missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles, the historic decision was Reagan’s refusal to sign a treaty at Reykjavik giving up SDI.  Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union was thereby vanquished within a few years. For most of the population in the world, the history of the 20th century can be summed up in one word:  Independence.  That is true for India (about 1 billion people), Indonesia (215 million), much of Africa (890 million), Israel, and Eastern Europe.  Additional nations, China (1 billion) and Latin America (523 million), had already acquired independence prior to the 20th century, but had important nationalistic movements during the 20th century too. Both Hindus and Muslims sought independence in South Asia, which now consists of India and the surrounding countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Afghanistan.  Many of those countries did not exist at the time of World War II.  The “Indian subcontinent” today consists primarily of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The Hindu group pushing for independence was the Congress Party, while the Muslim League was the pro-independence Islamic group led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah.  In 1946 the Great Calcutta Killing occurred, which was a riot between Hindus and Muslims resulting in 6,000 deaths. On both sides of India, East and West, were regions dominated by Islam.  In 1947, they achieved independence as East and West Pakistan based on a partition by the British House of Commons (East Pakistan later became Bangladesh).  Religious conflict continued.  Gandhi went to Delhi in January 1948 to urge fair treatment for Muslims, and was then assassinated by a Hindu. India received its independence from Great Britain on August 15, 1947, and instantly became the world’s most populous democracy.  Jawaharial Nehru was its first prime minister.  He began the long process of modernization and sought to de-emphasize the caste system.  Two years later, in 1949, a war broke out between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, and this dispute continues today - even though China seized part of Kashmir in 1962.  Both India and Pakistan joined the British Commonwealth as Dominion members and adopted English as their official languages.  India sought assistance from the Soviet Union, while Pakistan aligned with the United States. Nehru ruled India for nearly two decades, and, subsequent to his death, his daughter Indira Gandhi became prime minister in 1966 (despite her name, she was not related to the famous Gandhi).  Her rule saw an increase in agricultural production known as the “green revolution,” but she attempted to limit population growth with strict birth control.  She also suspended parts of the democratic process.  The people responded by defeating her in 1977, and she left office.  In 1980, she regained power, but violence was breaking out with Sikhs who wanted an independent state.  She ordered an attack on a Sikh temple, and two of her bodyguards retaliated by assassinating her in June 1984. Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother as the leader of India.  He lost power in 1989 based on accusations of corruption.  A group of Tamil terrorists from Sri Lanka killed him with a bomb in 1991.  Sri Lanka is the pear-shaped island off of the southern coast of India, which obtained its independence in 1948.  Sri Lanka has a Buddhist majority, and the Tamils are a Hindu minority there who have been fighting for their own independence.  Rajiv Gandhi had sent troops into Sri Lanka under a 1983 agreement to disarm the rebellious Hindus, which was unsuccessful. Shifting over to the history of the eastern portion of Pakistan, Indian-backed forces overthrew the government of East Pakistan in 1971 and established the new country of Bangladesh.  The eastern and western parts of Pakistan had different ethnicities and languages and were separated by over a thousand miles, unable to remain united despite both parts being Muslim. West Pakistan then became Pakistan.  In 1999, General Pervez Musharraf seized power by overthrowing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.  Before him, Benazir Bhutto was a remarkable woman prime minister for this Muslim country.  Bhutto was a strong, outspoken pro-life leader. Today Pakistan is one of the few Islamic nations possessing the atomic bomb, which it developed in the 21st century, much to the consternation of the rest of the world. When India and Pakistan sought and obtained independence from the British, other British and Dutch colonies in Asia attained similar independence.  In Southeast Asia, Burma gained independence in 1948, and chose not to be a member of the British Commonwealth.  It then suffered from some internal conflicts between communists and military dictators.  In 1989, Burma renamed itself Myanmar. Ethnic conflict hurt British efforts to create a single nation of Malaysia after World War II.  Large groups of Chinese and Malay peoples fought each other in Southeast Asia.  In 1957, a Federation of Malaya brought together Singapore, Malaya, Sarawak, and Sabah.  But in 1965, Singapore left the federation to become a separate nation composed of only one successful city.  Today Singapore is one of the few city-states in the world, and is very prosperous.  After Singapore split off, the other three regions (Malaya, Sarawak and Sabah) formed the Federation of Malaysia. Indonesia had been a Dutch colony until the Japanese conquered it early in World War II.  After the war, Sukarno led a successful rebellion against the Dutch and established the independence of Indonesia in 1949.  But Sukarno was unable to establish a democracy, perhaps because Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world. In 1965 there was a coup (rebellion) attempt in Indonesia, and General Suharto brutally suppressed it, killing perhaps a million people including many communists.  In this striking battle between Islam and communism, Islam won.  In 1967, Suharto appointed himself president and created a police state.  He persecuted the Chinese and Christians, and in 1976 he seized East Timor and annexed it to Indonesia. In addition to the British and Dutch, the United States also granted independence to its Asian colony:  the Philippines (on July 4, 1946).  The United States kept military bases on the Philippines under 99-year leases, but later gave up those leases under criticism of being imperialistic.  The U.S. left her bases there in 1991. The Philippines has a history of communist insurgency, and President Ferdinand Marcos suppressed the communists during his rule from 1966 to 1986.  For ten years during that period he even imposed martial law.  But when Benigno Aquino, a political opponent of Marcos, was immediately assassinated upon his return to the country from the United States, American newspapers blamed Marcos for the killing and demanded his resignation.  He would not resign; however, Aquino’s widow Corazon Aquino defeated Marcos in the election of 1986.  Time magazine named her \'Woman of the Year,\' and Marcos fled to Hawaii, where he eventually died. Five European powers – Great Britain, Belgium, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands – had divided Africa into colonies during the Imperialism Era.  Their divisions showed no regard for ethnic groups and local culture.  Europeans created huge farms that could be more profitable for the mother country, such as cash-crop plantations.  When it came time for the Europeans to leave, the African economy lacked self-sufficiency. There was a middle class in Africa.  Many Africans were educated in the Western world, and they led a pro-African or pan-African movement called “Negritude”.  This built pride in African culture and accomplishments. Great Britain had three large African colonies:  Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana.  Nigeria was most populous colony in Africa and one of the most prosperous, and it won its independence in 1960.  But its ethnic diversity led to civil war between the Muslim Hausa-Fulani and the Christian Igbo and Yoruba.  There was tension even within the Christian groups, as Igbo preferred a democratic society while the Yoruba preferred a monarchy. Oil was discovered in Nigeria and it joined OPEC.  But the Muslim Hausa-Fulani seized power in 1983 and ruled for 16 years, discriminating against the Christians.  In 1999, a civilian government was reestablished pursuant to a new constitution. A Kenyan nationalist Jomo Kenyatta, who had been educated in Britain, joined a secret organization known as Mau Mau. Its purpose was to drive the British out and establish independence in 1963.  The United States, fearing infiltration by communists, sided with Britain in opposing this.  Kenyatta established Nairobi as a business center in East Africa.  Daniel arap Moi succeeded Kenyatta upon his death in 1978.  Ethnic strife and protests for greater democracy plagued Kenya at the end of the 20th century. The British Colony of the Gold Coast (Ghana) was the first of all these to achieve independence.  Kwame Nkrumah was helped by the communists and by his education in the United States.  He spent money on improving roads and education and health care, but the economy failed as a result.  He was also a leader establishing the Pan-African Congress in 1945 with the help of Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey.  The goal of this organization, along with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) (founded in 1963), was to establish an Africa ruled by Africans.  But in 1966, the Ghana military revolted against Nkrumah while he was away in China, presumably on a mission to obtain more communist aid.  Power has frequently changed hands in Ghana ever since, and at two points (1979 and 1981) a Ghana Air Force pilot named Jerry Rawlings served as president. France had many small colonies in Africa, including Morocco and Tunisia, to which France granted independence in 1956.  But France’s primary colony was Algeria, a Muslim country in North Africa.  Instead of granting it independence, France offered citizenship to all the Algerians, which explains why the Muslim population in France is larger than in other European countries today. The Algerians wanted independence despite the presence of thousands of French citizens in Algeria.  In 1945, there was a bloody demonstration for independence, and in 1954 the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) demanded full independence.  The French responded by sending troops to suppress the FLN. In 1958, Charles de Gaulle successfully returned to power in France, after having led France during World War II.  He feared an Algerian rebellion, and favored granting independence to it and others.  France officially granted Algeria independence in 1962, and Ahmed Ben Bella became its first prime minister.  In 1965, Ben Bella was deposed (overthrown).  A fully Islamic government took control in 1985 due in part to a drop in the price of oil, which caused a crisis in the Algerian economy. Belgium held the Congo as an African colony for mining copper and producing rubber.  When Belgium granted Congo its independence in 1960 and Patrice Lumumba was sworn in its its first prime minister, the young nation was unprepared.  Moise Tshombe, a leader of southeast region that had the copper mines, announced its separate independence.  Tshombe was backed by Belgians interested in the copper, while Lumumba was supported by the communist Soviet Union.  Joseph Mobutu, with sympathy from the West, then overthrew Lumumba, who was then murdered.  Tshombe ruled for a short period until he, too, was overthrown by Mobutu. Mobutu renamed the nation Zaire, and ruled it for 32 years.  He personally accumulated enormous wealth from the nation, until he was deposed (overthrown) by Laurent Kabila in 1997.  Kabila then changed the nation\'s name to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The neighboring countries of Rwanda and Uganda supported an insurrection in 1998, and a civil war resulted between the pro-Kabila Hutu tribe and the anti-Kabila Tutsi tribe.  As more African nations became involved in this conflict in Central Africa, it began to look like the first all-African war.  The United Nations sent peacekeeping troops in February 2000 and a cease-fire was declared later that year. Portugal suppressed independence movements in its colony of Angola until 1975, when opposition to the continuing expenses caused an overthrow of the government in the mother country of Portugal itself.  Once free, three different revolutionary groups fought each other for control of Angola:  (1) the communist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which grabbed the Angolan capital city of Luanda, (2) the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), which was supported by Zaire and the United States, and (3) the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which was aided by South Africa and the United States.  Peace was not achieved until 1988 and only then did the communist Cuban troops leave.  All three groups continue to seek representation in the Angolan government. South Africa was the most complex, and the most prosperous, of all African colonies.  As early as the 1600s, the Dutch established Cape Town as a city at the southern tip of Africa.  But during the Napoleonic Wars the British captured Cape Town (in 1815) and drove the Dutch (the “Boers”) inland.  The Dutch favored continuation of slavery; the British abolished slavery in its empire in 1833. The Boers fought the native Africans (Bantu tribes such as the Zulus) during the Great Trek of the Boers.  The Boers founded two inland republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.  But the British were more powerful, and controlled wealthy diamond mines.  The Brit Cecil Rhodes acquired great wealth through his monopoly of the diamond production in 1889, and he served as prime minister of the British Cape Colony from 1890 to 1896. A Boer War ensued from 1899 to 1902, and afterward it was the Boers (the Dutch) who established “apartheid”.  Apartheid segregated the majority blacks from the minority whites in South Africa, with the white minority controlling the country. The British granted South Africa independence in 1910, and it became a member of the British Commonwealth in 1931 with its constitution allowing white rule over the blacks.  But the country was prosperous, and all enjoyed a higher standard of living than the remainder of Africa. The Dutch South Africans (Afrikaner) gained control in 1948 when their National Party rose to power and enforced apartheid throughout South Africa.  Homelands (segregated areas) were even established for the rival African tribes, and the whites reserved the best property for themselves.  Ever since 1912 the all-black African National Congress (ANC) objected, but it was suppressed.  Demonstrations, such as the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre, occasionally broke out but were violently put down.  An ANC leader named Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for his role in that demonstration.  Riots over school segregation occurred in Soweto in 1976, and in 1977 the government beat an outspoken critic, Steve Biko, to death. There was increasing pressure worldwide for South Africa to end its racism.  Its athletes were banned from the Olympics since the 1960s, and trade restrictions were imposed by other nations.  A black South African bishop, Desmond Tutu, called for boycotts of his own nation. In 1989, a new South African president named F.W. de Klerk was elected, and he ended apartheid in 1993.  With international approval, de Klerk legalized the ANC, released Nelson Mandela from jail, obtained repeal of apartheid laws, and agreed to fully democratic elections in 1994.  Nelson Mandela then won those elections and the ANC won a majority in the National Assembly, the bigger house in the South African Parliament.  A new constitution containing a bill of rights like that in the United States was adopted in 1996, but also included entitlements.  In the same year, liberals passed a pro-abortion law and the number of abortions there has tragically increased 100 times between 1990 and today.  The world fully accepts South Africa now, and it hosted the World Cup (soccer) in 2010.  But while the outside world accepts South Africa, the country has been hurt by a mass exodus due to increased crime.  ""We as a nation cannot afford to lose skilled and hard-working citizens of whatever hue,"" declared one South African candidate for high office in 2006.[3] Somalia is a Muslim country that is a combination of former colonies known as British Somaliland, French Somaliland and Italian Somaliland.  Somalia has been Muslim since A.D. 900 and today is considered one of the bases for the terrorist group al-Qaida.  Roughly the size of New Jersey in area and population, Somalia is located on the coast of East Africa (the Indian Ocean) and borders both Ethiopia and Kenya.  Somalia obtained its independence in 1960.  The violence is so bad in Somalia today that it has no central government at all.  In 1993, 18 American soldiers were killed in Somalia, and on Jan. 9, 2007 the United States bombed parts of the country where al-Qaida terrorists were believed to be hiding. “Zionism” began in the late 1800s to reestablish a Jewish state in Palestine in and around Jerusalem, which the ancient Hebrews had built.  Theodor Herzl led the movement in the 1890s to establish a modern state of Israel.  Jewish people were motivated partly by the religious faith that Jerusalem and Palestine were the Promised Land, and partly motivated by a desire to live together again after many centuries of dispersion in other lands, where they endured persecution.  The Russian pogroms of violence against Jewish settlements reinforced the desire for a new Jewish homeland.  The “Dreyfus Affair” in France in 1894, whereby a French captain was persecuted based on a false accusation of selling military secrets to Germany, added to the desire for a Jewish nation that could defend against persecution. The Turks controlled Palestine for centuries leading up to World War I, but the defeat of the Ottoman Turks in that war allowed Great Britain to assume control of the territory.  Its Balfour Declaration (1917) favored a Jewish homeland while protecting rights of Arabs living there.  Between the world wars many Jewish settlers from Europe migrated to Palestine and set up communal agricultural settlements known as kibbutzim, in anticipation of a new Jewish state.   The Jewish population in Palestine increased from about 84,000 in 1922 to 554,000 in 1945, but the Muslim population also increased by almost an identical amount from 589,000 to about 1,036,000.  Today there are about 5 million people of Jewish origin living in Israel.  Relatively few Jewish citizens of the United States have moved to Palestine, but they have generously lent financial and political support for the Zionist cause. The Balfour Declaration called for the creation of Palestinian state in addition to Israel.  Lawrence of Arabia (a British leader, T.E. Lawrence, who inspired an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks during World War I) then helped create Jordan (originally Transjordan) as a semi-autonomous Palestinian state in 1921.  Jordan attained its full independence in 1946.  But later there were demands for another Palestinian state.  Lawrence of Arabia favored promotion of the British Empire in the Middle East, and resisted creation of a Jewish state as a threat to British influence in the region.  Others opposed the creation of a Jewish state by arguing that it would be imperialistic, and migrating Russian Jews were accused of imperialism. World War II changed many things, and after the war Great Britain asked the United Nations to partition Palestine.  The United Nations carved out a small parcel of property, slightly smaller than the state of New Jersey, for a new Jewish state to be named “Israel” (see map).  This new nation was born on May 14, 1948, with David Ben-Gurion as its first prime minister and renowned scientist Chaim Weizmann as its first president. The Muslim Arabs refused to accept the existence of Israel.  The surrounding Arab states invaded Israel the next day, and started additional wars in 1956, 1967 and 1973.  The conflicts prevented the United Nations plan for a separate Palestinian state from happening. The 1967 “Six-Day War” resulted when the Egyptian ruler Gamal Abdel Nasser closed off the Gulf of Aqaba, which was the only access Israel had to the Red Sea.  Israel responded with massive air strikes against several Arab nations, including Egypt, killing many Arabs and destroying their militaries.  Israel conquered Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights.  Palestinians in Jerusalem were offered the opportunity to become Israeli citizens, but many declined, leaving them without a country. Anwar Sadat succeeded Nasser as ruler of Egypt, and in October 1973, Sadat launched a surprise attack on Israel on its holy day, Yom Kippur.  After suffering massive initial losses, the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, regained much of the lost territory.  Golda Meir was the third women in history to run a nation, and David Ben-Gurion once described her as “the only man in the Cabinet” of Israel.  However, she was forced to resign the following year based on criticism of how she handled the war.  Winston Churchill also lost power as soon as World War II was over.  Maybe voters simply wanted to replace someone who reminded them of the bad memories of war. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter brokered a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, then led by Menachem Begin, and this deal is known as the Camp David Accords.  Egypt agreed to recognize Israel in exchange for receiving return of the Sinai Peninsula.  The United States promised both countries a massive amount of foreign aid, about $10 billion each year in gifts to each nation, to complete the deal.  Though Sadat was assassinated by Muslims in 1981, his successor (Hosni Mubarak) promised to continue to honor the deal.  Mubarak was overthrown in 2011. Yasir Arafat, a former construction engineer, founded the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964.  It demanded a Palestinian state in the area of Jerusalem and rejected the right of Israel to exist.  During the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, PLO terrorists kidnapped and murdered Israeli athletes.  In 1987, the PLO instituted a campaign of persistent violence called “intifada”, where common citizens and even children threw stones at Israelis and committed additional violence.  Arab nations boycotted Israeli goods and even attempted to boycott any company that did business with Israel. Secret talks between Israeli leaders and the PLO in Oslo, Norway culminated with the Declaration of Principles in 1993, whereby Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin agreed to allow Palestinian self-rule over two strips of land known as the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and Arafat and Rabin signed the agreement in front of President Clinton at the White House in 1993.  This angered orthodox Jewish Israelis who had been building settlements in both regions, and one assassinated Rabin in 1995.  A more conservative leader emerged in Israel named Benjamin Netanyahu, who negotiated a partial withdrawal by Israeli settlers from Hebron, which is on the West Bank, in 1997.  In 2005, Israel removed its settlements from the Gaza Strip, and there is a quasi-Palestinian state called the Palestinian National Authority that functions under Arafat’s successor, Mahmoud Abbas. In the early 21st century, Israel endured a series of horrific suicide bombings, often targeting Jewish weddings, buses, caregivers and even children.  Weekly and sometimes daily there would be new reports of a half-dozen Jews murdered by a Muslim suicide bomber, and sometimes a second bomb would detonate to murder those who came to the aid of the initial victims.  Israel finally stopped the bombings by building a wall to end the flow of weapons and terrorists from hostile neighbors. Russia and other nations in the Soviet Union regained their independence when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.  One Russian then predicted that the United States will eventually break up in a similar way. Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power in the Soviet Union and in 1985 he promoted a new policy called “glasnost” or openness.  This ended decades of censorship by the communist dictators, and free speech began to work wonders.  Books could be published and churches could preach the Gospel.  He released some political prisoners.  Faced with a failing economy, Gorbachev adopted “perestroika”, which was a restructuring of the Soviet economy.  He permitted some ownership of private property, such as small businesses, farms and factories. In 1987, Gorbachev introduced democratization that allowed fairer, more competitive elections.  Gorbachev remained a dedicated communist, but he wanted voters to be able to choose between rival candidates rather than simply electing those candidates presented only by the Communist Party.  He also encouraged Eastern European countries adopt reforms. As explained in more detail below, Eastern Europe took advantage of Gorbachev’s reforms to the point where they broke away from strict communism.  This led Lithuania, which had been annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940, to declare its independence in March 1990.  Gorbachev responded as his communist predecessors would have:  he blockaded the rebellious country and, when that did not work, in January 1991 he ordered the Soviet troops to attack the capital of Lithuania.  Civilians were slaughtered. But perhaps Providence intervened this time.  Boris Yeltsin, a charismatic Russian, emerged to challenge Gorbachev’s leadership.  Yeltsin had been a popular mayor of Moscow and was a powerful member of the parliament.  In June 1991, the voters elected Yeltsin as president of a new Russian Republic. Communists were angry and determined to stop Yeltsin’s challenge.  In August 1991, they ordered the soldiers to kill Yeltsin.  Miraculously, the troops refused the order.  Rarely do troops refuse orders.  In a communist country, such refusal was unheard of.  Gorbachev promptly resigned as head of the Communist Party, and then Latvia, Estonia and other Soviet republics declared their independence as Lithuania had.  On Christmas Day of 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union. By then, Russia and the other newly independent republics had formed a federation to replace the Soviet Union, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  All joined except for the Baltic republics and Georgia, a large former Soviet state not to be confused with the American state of Georgia. After Gorbachev resigned, Yeltsin brought free enterprise to Russia.  He ended price controls, cut taxes, stopped subsidizing government-controlled industries and reduced trade barriers.  Churches opened and flourished.  The people of Leningrad changed the name of their city back to Saint Petersburg.  Critics of Yeltsin complained about inflation and the loss of jobs, and organized crime became a problem without the KGB controlling everything.  But the Russian people were not going back to communism.  Today Russia has lower taxes than the United States, and Russia has passed pro-life laws.  Christianity is growing there. Muslim-dominated Chechnya in southwest Russia became a difficult issue for Yeltsin.  In 1991, it declared its independence from Russia, but Yeltsin suppressed that by sending troops to Grozny, its capital city.  Resistance by the Chechens was intense, and the troops were initially withdrawn.  But a bloody civil war has ensued for over a decade, including hostage-takings and, in 2004, the Chechen rebels seized a large school near Chechnya and killed over 300 of the children and teachers. The fall of communism in the Soviet Union really began in the Eastern European “satellite” countries of communism, initially in Poland and Hungary.  In 1978, the Roman Catholic Church elected the first non-Italian pope in many centuries, elevating a Polish cardinal who had been active in the anticommunist movement in his homeland of Poland.  Pope John Paul II then became a leader and hero to his countrymen in Poland, which is nearly 100% Catholic.  Another Polish leader, Lech Walesa, led a strike against a shipyard in Gdansk in 1980, demanding government recognition for his labor union called Solidarity.  The Polish communist government was weak at this time and vacillated in its response, but in 1981 it cracked down on Solidarity and imposed marital law throughout the country.  A popular anticommunist priest was then murdered.  An assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II, also thought to have been organized by communists, injured but did not kill him. As conflict worsened in Poland, Pope John Paul II visited the country and attracted literally millions of supporters.  At one point, he stood at the podium with the communist-installed leader and lectured him about respecting the dignity and freedom of the Polish people.  The communist leader trembled in front of the huge crowd.  When the Soviet Union threatened to crack down on the Polish people, the Pope declared that he would respond by returning to Poland to fight on the front lines against the communists. In April 1989, the Polish government allowed free elections for the first time since World War II, and the people elected Lech Walesa as president and his group Solidarity swept into office.  Communism was defeated.  The fall of communism in Poland had this great effect:  the new Christian-based government banned abortion, and it has decreased to nearly zero there.  Abortion rates in the communist Soviet Union had been several times higher than the rest of the world. Hungary, the same country that attempted to overthrow communism in 1956, immediately followed Poland’s lead.  In October 1989, opponents of the Communist Party took it over and dissolved it.  A new constitution allowed for national elections in 1990, and the people defeated the communists in power.  Hungary embraced some free enterprise and started a stock market.  But like much of Eastern Europe, socialists remained powerful and in 1994 they crept back into power and raised taxes.  Today Hungary is a mixture of socialism and free enterprise. Hungary helped end communism in East Germany, which was the most brutal of the communist regimes.  Hungary opened its border to allow East Germans to emigrate into Austria, from where they could escape entirely.  As East Germans began to leave in droves, the communist leader Erich Honecker closed the border.  But demonstrations broke out in October 1989, which not even the ruthless Honecker could control.  He resigned and his successor, Egon Krenz, reacted by opening the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.  East Germans then poured into West Berlin and tore down the wall entirely.  By the end of the year communism was defeated in East Germany, and within a year it was reunited with West Germany to form one nation of Germany under West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  Germans expect that it will take an entire generation (30-40 years) to bring the formerly communist section up to the prosperity of the free West Germany. Other Eastern European countries then wanted the same freedom from communism.  In Czechoslovakia, demonstrations forced the Communist Party leader Milos Jakes to resign in November 1989, and he was replaced by Vaclav Havel.  In 1993, the country split along ethnic lines to form Slovakia and the Czech Republic, caused in part by economic difficulties in the conversion from communism to free enterprise. Next came Romania, which had been ruled for decades by the communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.  Massive demonstrations against his rule in December 1989 caused the army to join the people, and they captured Ceausescu as he attempted to flee with his wife.  They were executed on Christmas Day; the timing suggests that the revolutionaries were not good people themselves.  But at least free elections began in 1990. Ceausescu opposed abortion, unlike most communists.  Ceausescu’s ban on abortion there had helped avoid many of the health problems caused by abortion.  Romanians had the lowest incidence of women’s breast cancer in the Western world, far lower than the United States.  In 1990, American families rushed to Romania to adopt babies who were available for adoption there.  But after Ceausescu was overthrown and abortion was legalized, Romania began promoting abortion.  The abortion-related health problem of breast cancer then skyrocketed. The collapse of the communist dictatorship exposed underlying ethnic and religious conflict, particularly in Yugoslavia.  Its dictator, Marshall Tito (real name Josip Broz), ruled with an iron fist from 1945 to 1980, preventing the different ethnic groups from fighting each other because he suppressed all conflict.  He also insisted on some independence from the Soviet Union, and Stalin expelled him from the Soviet bloc in 1948.  Tito was succeeded in power by the Serb Slobodan Milosevic, which caused Slovenia and Croatia to seek independence due to their different ethnicity.  In June 1991, the Yugoslavian army attempted to suppress these independence movements. Bloodshed continued in Croatia as the Serbs battled the Croats.  Eventually, the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened in 1999 in what is known as the Kosovo War or Kosovo Conflict, driving Milosevic from power and forcing his trial by an international tribunal.  He died of natural causes during a lengthy ""war crimes"" trial. Ethnic conflict was even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which consists of Muslims, Croats and Serbs, who are Christian.  Bosnia-Herzegovina first declared its independence from Serbia, but the Christian Bosnian Serbs did not want to live under Muslim rule and a civil war began in March 1992 over whether Bosnia would split from Serbia.  Anti-Christian press accused the Serbs of “ethnic cleansing,” or racially motivated mass murders, as the Serbs were allegedly killing off Bosnian Muslims.  A peacekeeping army was sent by the United Nations.  In December 1995, the Muslims, Croats and Serbs signed a peace treaty.  In 1996 a three-person presidency including a leader from each group was elected. The conflict in Bosnia caused the United Nations (U.N.) to send troops, including American soldiers, into the region in 1995.  Michael G. New was an American soldier who objected to wearing United Nations insignia as part of his military uniform during a deployment to the nearby Republic of Macedonia as part of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force.  Michael New objected to changing his allegiance from the United States to the U.N.  When Michael New enlisted in the U.S. Army in February 1993, he took an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution, not the United Nations. But on May 3, 1994, President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 25 (PDD-25).  This ordered submission of American troops to multilateral peace operations.  In July, Michael New was assigned to Germany, 3rd Infantry Division, and his company was told it would be sent to Macedonia as part of a “peacekeeping” mission.  In August 1995, Michael New was informed that his unit must wear part of the U.N. uniform.  Soldier New’s position was that the order was unlawful and unconstitutional.  Specifically, U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 9 prohibits any person’s acceptance of any emolument from a foreign state without congressional consent.  New also argued that the entire deployment as part of a United Nations force was unlawful. But the military judge and courts rejected New’s arguments and held that the legality of the deployment was a ""non-justiciable"" political question which could only be handled by a political branch of government (such as Congress or the President). In 1978, Deng Xiaoping succeeded Mao and Zhou as dictator in China.  He was more friendly to capitalism and the West, and began a program called the Four Modernizations.  He abolished communes and began leasing land to farmers who could work the land for personal profit.  He permitted private businesses and some foreign investment in special economic zones (SEZs).  He promoted tourism and sent many Chinese teenagers to the West to be educated in Western colleges.  But when Chinese students sought greater freedoms and democracy, Deng brutally suppressed them by sending tanks to Tiananmen Square to massacre hundreds of demonstrators on June 4, 1989. Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng when he died in 1997.  He refused to improve China’s record on human rights, and Christianity and democracy remain suppressed there.  Today China points many of its nuclear missiles at California. On July 1, 1997, Great Britain’s lease on Hong Kong expired and Britain returned it to China, which promised to keep Hong Kong capitalist for 50 more years. ""Latin America"" includes Spanish America and Brazil, where Portuguese is the primary language.  In other words, Latin America is all of America south of the United States, other than the Caribbean islands.  Latin America is thus Mexico, Central and South America.  It has 523 million people, far more than the U.S. population of about 300 million. The nations of Latin America had won their political independence from European powers long before the 20th century.  But they have struggled in becoming economically independent.  It was not until the middle of the 20th century that Latin American nations began to export manufactured goods in addition to minerals and food.  In the 1970s and 1980s, huge debts to foreign powers combined with a depression caused severe economic problems.  Lending policies of developed nations and their organizations, such as the World Bank, led to this debt crisis.  By 2000, after much loan forgiveness and an improved worldwide economy, Latin American nations had stronger economies and less dependence on foreign powers. In Mexico, the rule of President Lazaro Cardenas from 1934 to 1940 redistributed land from the wealthy to peasants.  He also forced foreign investors to give up control over Mexican oil wells.  The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI for its Spanish initials) controlled Mexico from 1929 to 2000, when Vicente Fox of PAN (Partido Accion Nacional) was elected president.  The PRI was known for corruption and acting on behalf of wealthy Mexicans. In Argentina, the military has long controlled the government.  The most popular military ruler was Colonel Juan Peron, who was elected in 1946.  He became known for his “popular dictatorship.”  His wife, Eva Peron, was even more popular for her tremendous charisma.  Juan Peron ruled for over a decade, and brought industrialization and working class values to the nation.  He limited foreign ownership.  But critics felt Peron infringed too much on civil liberties.  He was deposed in 1955 but came back briefly in the 1970s.  In 1982, Argentina attempted to take the Falkland Islands, which are located off its shores in the Atlantic Ocean, away from the British, which fought back with the help of American intelligence and regained control of the islands.', 'Turning point: a protest in Mexico City after the student disappearances.

In the video preview to the opener, which will debut on Netflix on July 6, Seinfeld and Lewis visit the Omelet House for brunch. Seinfeld orders coffee with his eggs; Lewis abstains from coffee but orders three eggs. Lewis also keeps a comedic pace with the host. Often called the King of Comedy, Lewis orders and then asks the waitress her name. When the waitress responds, Lewis says, “Valerie?

Jerry Seinfeld knows today’s TV landscape is packed and that people are always on-the-go (with coffee in hand, probably). That’s why he offered a 93-second teaser on Wednesday for the upcoming season of his\xa0Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. In the new trailer, Matthew Broderick joins the host for an appropriately efficient preview of snippets from Seinfeld’s upcoming car chats\xa0from the 10th edition of his digital series. “Practically everyone is coming out with brand new, even longer, more complicated shows.

Since then, the streaming giant has become home to the series’ 59 previous episodes, which feature appearances from a variety of stars, including Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey and even former President Barack Obama.

Though Broderick is featured in the trailer introduction, he is not expected to make an appearance during the season. The short teaser features sound bites from each guest, including Baldwin reminiscing about his high school experience (with a demonstration of “gyrating”); McKinnon discussing her frequent — and often intense — recognition for her Hillary Clinton impersonation; and Morgan, who acknowledges his near-fatal car crash in which he was left in a coma for 10 days in 2014. The episode featuring Lewis was taped months prior to Aug. 20, 2017, when the iconic comedian died from heart disease at age 91.

who were the parties to the atlantic charter in 1941 what were their eight common principles,"['War leads to the erosion of liberty for the benefit of the military-industrial complex. \xa0World War II set in motion the destruction of privacy and the formation of an Orwellian Police State controlled by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of America. \xa0Under the guise of cooperation and mutual respect, countries signed secret agreements with the NSA to share signals intelligence (SIGINT) which in layman’s terms means your phone calls, instant messages, and more. \xa0[1] Shortly after World War II, the United States and its allies built the ECHELON system to spy on land and satellite-based communications worldwide. [2] Their closest allies, dubbed The Five Eyes (FVEY), received privileged treatment from the NSA community wherein these five countries share resources on a grand scale. [3] The Five Eyes are also know as AUSCANNZUKUS, short for AUStralia, CANada, New Zealand, UK, and US. \xa0 As time progressed the Five Eyes added two more tiers to their club: the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes.\xa0\xa0The Fourteen Eyes are officially known as\xa0SIGINT Seniors Europe, or “SSEUR” but I think we can unofficially call them: The New World Order. This Anglosphere-based NWO group is now hell-bent on a United Nations based one-world government, with a single digital currency\xa0worldwide, and a completely disarmed populace. [4] The recent Snowden-disclosures should be enough to wake the people, however informal gas station polls show that Average Joe has no clue. Each member of The Fourteen Eyes of the New World Order is subservient to the Five Eyes, and all other nations are enemies of the one-world government. \xa0To see this any other way is to have eyes and yet be blind. The Fourteen Eyes use their combined technocratic might to infiltrate, subjugate, and excommunicate all who oppose their political or financial agendas. \xa0The Five Eyes use their illuminated status to enslave the Nine side-kicks, as was the case during the Wikileaks disclosure of the US. government pushing Monsanto GMO corn into Paris, a Nine Eyes member. \xa0The US. State department also used their NSA and 14 Eyes to spy on anti-GMO activists in Paris, and “calibrate a\xa0target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU\xa0since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits.” Occupy Wall Street suffered a similar fate. [5] \xa0Through a combined lame-stream propaganda campaign and targeted domestic spying by the Department of Homeland Security, the will of the people was mocked, shunned, and silenced. \xa0The Fourteen Eyes form a freedom-slaying Voltron that is worse than Orwell’s nightmares and what Willis was talkin’ about. The Fourteen Eyes feed a brain in Nevada at the Utah Data Center. \xa0The NSA uses this massive database to silence activists, silence Congressmen, and even silence Generals. Still the question remains, who controls the NSA? How can any progress toward less government, less war, free energy, more freedom, and common abundance ever occur when globalist ideologies and Big Brother are hell-bent on destroying our borders, taking our guns, and ensuring nothing you do can stop our progress towards a one-world government. \xa0The Fourteen Eyes will have their New World Order so don’t protest, buy the GMO corn, and\xa0go shopping, stay scared! Britain’s GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That’s how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles. The documents show that, in this situation, the services did what is not only obvious, but also anchored in German law: They exchanged information. And they worked together extensively. That applies to the British and the Americans, but also to the BND, which assists the NSA in its Internet surveillance. [53] According to previously unpublished material from a bail hearing, Delisle walked into the embassy wearing a red ball cap and civilian clothes. He flashed his Canadian military identification and asked to meet with someone from GRU, the Russian military intelligence. Delisle was posted to the security unit HMCS Trinity, an intelligence facility at the naval dockyard in Halifax. It tracks vessels entering and exiting Canadian waters via satellites, drones and underwater devices. While there he worked on a system called the Stone Ghost, said CBC reporter Rob Gordon. “It’s a computer system that links the five eyes. The five eyes are the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. All their information is shared on the Stone Ghost computer. “He would go to work every time with a thumb drive and download reams of information, which he would then send to the Russians on a monthly basis. This went on for years and years and years.”\xa0He was paid between $2,800 and $3,000 a month for the information.\xa0In 2009, when Delisle wanted to stop dealing with the Russians, they sent him a picture of his daughter walking to school in Halifax. [6][7] The National Security Agency routinely shares raw intelligence data with Israel without first sifting it to remove information about US citizens, a top-secret document [8] provided to the Guardian by whistle-blower Edward Snowden reveals. Details of the intelligence-sharing agreement are laid out in a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart that shows the US government handed over intercepted communications likely to contain phone calls and emails of American citizens. The agreement places no legally binding limits on the use of the data by the Israelis. [9] Some foreign (and domestic —Ed.) observers regard any U.S. surveillance efforts with suspicion, fearing that intelligence products will be used against their national interests, the\xa0privacy rights of their citizens, or\xa0to advance the interests of U.S. firms in competition for international business. This view is held even though it is well-known that many countries have long undertaken similar efforts. Nonetheless, some argue that electronic surveillance, except in a narrow, court-approved, law enforcement context, should not be undertaken by democratic governments.

Moratoriums on Monsanto’s famous “MON 810” genetically modified (GMO) corn are being passed all across Europe due to people’s belief that these products are unsafe. Instead of respecting the people’s will, our state department considers making a “target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU” to help out their struggling buddies at Monsanto. 4. (C) France’s new “High Authority” on agricultural biotech is designed to roll back established science-based decision making. The recently formed authority is divided into two colleges, a scientific college and a second group including civil society and social scientists to assess the “common interest” of France. The authority’s first task is to review MON 810. In the meantime, however, the draft biotech law submitted to the National Assembly and the Senate for urgent consideration, could make any biotech planting impossible in practical terms. The law would make farmers and seed companies legally liable for pollen drift and sets the stage for inordinately large cropping distances. The publication of a registry identifying cultivation of GMOs at the parcel level may be the most significant measure given the propensity for activists to destroy GMO crops in the field. 5. (C) Both the GOF and the Commission have suggested that their respective actions should not alarm us since they are only cultivation rather than import bans. We see the cultivation ban as a first step, at least by anti-GMO advocates, who will move next to ban or further restrict imports. (The environment minister’s top aide told us that people have a right not to buy meat raised on biotech feed, even though she acknowledged there was no possible scientific basis for a feed based distinction.) Further, we should not be prepared to cede on cultivation because of our considerable planting seed business in Europe and because farmers, once they have had experience with biotech, become its staunchest supporters. 6.\xa0Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a\xa0target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU\xa0since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits. The list should be measured rather than vicious and must be sustainable over the long term, since we should not expect an early victory. [15] Let it be known: if you are an anti-GMO activist living in the United States of America or abroad, the full might of the Fourteen Eyes, the NSA, and the\xa0StoneGhost\xa0surveillance machine will bear down on you in defense of Monsanto. \xa0How many more companies are on the “cool kids” list? “The common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality.” \xa0Former CFR board member\xa0Walter Lippman,\xa0Public Opinion(1922) “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” “… once having joined the One-World Federated Government, no nation could secede or revolt … because with the Atom Bomb in its possession the Federal Government [of the World] would blow that nation off the face of the earth.” ” We must haul down the American flag … haul it down, stamp on it, spit on it. “ This organization was founded in Asheville, North Carolina as the result of a merger of five existing world government groups: American United for World Government; World Federalists, U.S.A.; Student Federalists; Georgia World Citizens Committee; and the Massachusetts Committee for World Federation.\xa0The United World Federalists is a non-partisan, non-profit organization with members in forty-eight states. It has 350 chapters in thirty-nine states and one chapter in Hawaii. State branches exist in twenty-seven states. The primary purpose of the organization is: Membership is open to any American except persons Communist or Fascist oriented. “We shall have world government whether or not you like it – by conquest or consent.” “Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.” TLB recommends at visit to ClimateViewer News for more pertinent information.

World War II was a total war; homeland production became even more invaluable to both the Allied and Axis powers. Life on the home front during World War II was a significant part of the war effort for all participants and had a major impact on the outcome of the war. Governments became involved with new issues such as rationing, manpower allocation, home defense, evacuation in the face of air raids, and response to occupation by an enemy power. The morale and psychology of the people responded to leadership and propaganda. Typically women were mobilized to an unprecedented degree. All of the powers involved had learned from their experiences good and bad on the home front during World War I. Their success in mobilizing economic output was a major factor in supporting combat operations. Among morale-boosting activities that also benefited combat efforts, the home front engaged in a variety of scrap drives for materials crucial to the war effort such as metal, rubber, and rags. The major powers devoted 50–61 percent of their total GDP to munitions production. The Allies produced about three times as much in munitions as the Axis powers. Source: Goldsmith data in Harrison (1988) p.\xa0172 The Allies called themselves the ""United Nations"" (even before that organization formed in 1945), and pledged their support to the Atlantic Charter of 1941. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; free access to raw materials; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as the disarmament of aggressor nations. The sudden German invasion of neutral Belgium in May 1940 led in a matter of 18 days to the collapse of the Belgian army; King Leopold obtained an armistice that involved direct German military administration. The King refused the demand of the government that he flee with them to Britain; he remained as a puppet ruler under German control. The Belgian bureaucracy remained in place and generally cooperated with the German rulers. Two pro-German movements, the Flemish National Union comprising Flemish (Dutch-speaking ) separatists and the Walloon (French-speaking ) Rexists led by Léon Degrelle (1906–94)  supported the invaders and encouraged their young men to volunteer for the German army.[1] Small but active resistance movements, largely Communist, provided intelligence to the Allies. During the Holocaust in Belgium, the Nazis hunted down the 70,000 Jews living in Belgium, most of them refugees, and killed 29,000 of them.[2] The Germans expected to exploit Belgium\'s industrial resources to support their war machine. Their policies created severe shortages for the Belgian people, but shipped out far less than Germany had expected. They set up the ""Armaments Inspection Board"" in 1940 to relay munitions orders to factories; the Board came under the control of the German Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer in 1943, and had offices in industrial areas that were supposed to facilitate orders for materiél, and supervise production. However, factory production fell sharply after 1942. Although collaboration with the Nazis, especially among the Flemish, was evident in 1940, it soon faded in importance. Labor strikes and systematic sabotage slowed production, as did the emigration of workers to rural areas, Allied bombing, food shortages, and worker resentment to forced labor.[3] The Allies retook all of Belgium in September 1944 as the Germans retreated. They reappeared briefly during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, but were finally expelled in January 1945. The London‐based government‐in‐exile returned, but had to confront the resistance movements that demanded radical political change.[4] China suffered the second highest number of casualties of the entire war. Civilians in the occupied territories had to endure many large-scale massacres, including that in Nanking. In a few areas, Japanese forces also unleashed newly developed biological weapons on Chinese civilians leading to an estimated 200,000 dead.[5] Tens of thousands died when Nationalist troops broke the levees of the Yangtze to stop the Japanese advance after the loss of the Chinese capital, Nanjing. Millions more Chinese died because of famine during the war. Japan captured major coastal cities like Shanghai early in the war; cutting the rest of China off from its chief sources of finance and industry. Millions of Chinese moved to remote regions to avoid invasion. Cities like Kunming ballooned with new arrivals. Entire factories and universities were often taken along so the society could still function. Japan replied with hundreds of air raids on the new capital of Chongqing. Although China received much aid from the United States, China did not have sufficient infrastructure to properly arm or even feed its military forces, let alone its civilians. China was divided into three zones, with the Nationalists in the southwest and the Communists led by Mao Zedong (Mao) in control of much of the northwest. Coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese and civilians were treated harshly; young men were drafted into a puppet Chinese army. After the stunningly quick victory in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war and part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country.[6] The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them in prisoner of war camps inside Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. The Vichy French government, cooperated closely with the Germans, sending food, machinery and workers to Germany. Several hundred thousand Frenchmen and women were forced to work in German factories, or volunteered to do so, as the French economy itself deteriorated. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. Most Jews were rounded up by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans, who sent them to death camps.[7][8] The two million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families.[9] Meanwhile, the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles.[10] After the war, France gave women the vote and additional legal and political rights, although nothing on the scale of the enfranchisement that followed World War I. Women suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods and the absence of the men in POW camps.[11] The rationing system was stringent and badly mismanaged, leading to pronounced malnourishment, black markets and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about 20% of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people.[12] French farm production fell by half because of the lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so, the Germans seized half the meat and 20% of the produce.[13] Supply problems quickly affected French stores, which lacked most items. The government responded by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting young people in urban areas. At shops, the queues lengthened. Some people—including German soldiers who could take advantage of arbitrary exchange rates that favored Germany—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without coupons at very high prices. Farmers diverted meat to the black market, which meant that there was much less for the open market. Counterfeit food coupons were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. Vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition were prevalent.[14] Advice about eating a healthier diet and home growing produce was distributed. Slogans like \'Digging for Victory\' and \'Make Do and Mend\' appeared on national posters and became a part of the war effort. The city environment made these efforts nearly negligible.[15] In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted survival. The official ration provided starvation-level diets of 1,300 or fewer calories a day (5400 kJ), supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.[16] The Dutch famine of 1944, known as the Hongerwinter (""Hunger winter"") was a man-made famine imposed by Germany in the occupied western provinces during the winter of 1944–1945. A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm areas. A total of 4.5 million people were affected, of whom 18,000 died, despite an elaborate system of emergency soup kitchens.[17] The Nazi Hunger Plan was to kill the Jews of Poland quickly, and slowly to force the Poles to leave by threat of starvation, so that they could be replaced by German settlers. The Nazis coerced Poles to work in Germany by providing favorable food rations for families who had members working in the Reich. The ethnic German population in Poland (Volksdeutsche) were given good rations and were allowed to shop for food in special stores. The German occupiers created a draconian system of food controls, including severe penalties for the omnipresent black market. There was a sharp increase in mortality due to the general malnutrition, and a decline in birth rates.[18][19][20][21] By mid 1941, the German minority in Poland received 2,613 calories (11,000 kJ) per day, while Poles received 699 and Jews in the ghetto 184.[22] The Jewish ration fulfilled just 7.5% of their daily needs; Polish rations only 26%. Only the ration allocated to Germans provided the full required calorie intake.[23] Additionally the Generalplan Ost of the Nazis, which envisioned the elimination of the Slavic population in the occupied territories and artificial famines-as proposed in the Hunger Plan, were to be used. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, conquering it in three weeks, as the Soviets invaded the eastern areas. During the German occupation, there were two distinct civilian uprisings in Warsaw, one in 1943, the other in 1944. The first took place in an entity, less than two square miles (5 km2) in area, which the Germans had carved out of the city and called Ghetto Warschau. The Germans built high walls around the ghetto, and crowded 550,000 Polish Jews into it, many from the Polish provinces. At first, people were allowed to enter and leave the ghetto, but soon its border became an ""iron curtain"". Unless on official business, Jews could not leave, and non-Jews, including Germans, could not enter. Entry points were guarded by German soldiers. Because of extreme conditions and hunger, mortality in the ghetto was high. In 1942, the Germans moved 400,000 ghetto residents to Treblinka where they were gassed on arrival. By April 19, 1943, when the Ghetto Uprising commenced, the population of the ghetto had dwindled to 60,000 individuals. In the following three weeks, virtually all died as the Germans fought and systematically destroyed the buildings in the ghetto.[25] The uprising by Poles began on August 1, 1944, when the Polish underground, the ""Home Army"", aware that the Soviet Army had reached the eastern bank of the Vistula, sought to liberate Warsaw much as the French resistance had liberated Paris a few weeks earlier. Joseph Stalin had his own group of Communist leaders for the new Poland and did not want the Home Army or its leaders (based in London) to control Warsaw. So he halted the Soviet offensive and gave the Germans free rein to suppress it. During the ensuing 63 days, 250,000 Poles of the Home Army surrendered to the Germans. After the Germans forced all the surviving population to leave the city, Hitler ordered that any buildings left standing be dynamited – 98 percent of the buildings in Warsaw were destroyed.[26] During the invasion of the Soviet Union in the early months of the war, rapid German advances almost captured the cities of Moscow and Leningrad. The bulk of Soviet industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain crops left standing in the fields  This caused hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1,523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Ural, and Siberia.[27] In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labor. The whole of the Soviet Union become dedicated to the war effort. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food.[28] Conditions were nevertheless severe. World War II was especially devastating to citizens of the USSR because it was fought on Soviet territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over a million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and old people. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Off-ration food was often so expensive that it could not add substantially to a citizen\'s food supply unless they were especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with any local resources they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold their surplus food at a high price; a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.[29] Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied to protect their Motherland against the evils of the German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of a Communist Party propaganda campaign to mobilize religious people. Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war, and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honors and money benefits if they had several children—mothers could earn around 1,300 rubles for having their fourth child and up to 5,000 rubles for their tenth.[30] The city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during World War II. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege, which lasted from September 1941 until January 1944. Many people lost weight, and grew weaker and more vulnerable to disease. If malnutrition persisted for long enough, its effects were irreversible. People\'s feelings of loyalty disappeared if they got hungry enough; they would steal from their closest family members in order to survive.[31] Only some of the citizens of Leningrad survived. Only 400,000 were evacuated before the siege began; this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. Subsequently, more managed to escape; especially when the nearby Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or ""road of life""—to safety.[32] Those in influential political or social positions used their connections to other elites to leave Leningrad both before and after the siege began. Some factory owners even looted state funds to secure transport out of the city during the first summer of the war.[33] The most risky means of escape, however, was to defect to the enemy and hope to avoid governmental punishment. Most survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck: for instance by securing factory employment, because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the requirements for survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers received larger rations than other civilians, and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced vital goods. Factories also served as mutual support centers, and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horsemeat in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.[34] Survival opportunities open to the wider Soviet community included barter and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with civilians who had extra warm clothes to exchange. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens could keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.[35] Many of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime to support themselves. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards; this could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes such as murder and cannibalism also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.[36] In the United States, farming and other production was increased. For example, citizens were encouraged to plant ""victory gardens"", personal farms that children sometimes worked on.[37] Standlee (2010) argues that during the war the traditional gender division of labor changed somewhat, as the ""home"" or domestic female sphere expanded to include the ""home front""; meanwhile the public sphere—the male domain—was redefined as the international stage of military action.[38] The Philippines was an American possession on the way to independence (scheduled in 1946) and controlled its own internal affairs. The Japanese invaded and quickly conquered the islands in early 1942. The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines and established the Philippine Executive Commission. They initially organized a Council of State, through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic headed by President José P. Laurel proved to be ineffective and unpopular as Japan maintained very tight controls.[39] Japanese occupation of the Philippines was opposed by large-scale underground and guerrilla activity. The Philippine Army, as well as remnants of the U.S. Army Forces Far East continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war. They formed an auxiliary unit of the United States Army. Their effectiveness was such that by the end of the war, Japan controlled only twelve of the forty-eight provinces. One element of resistance in the Central Luzon area was furnished by the Hukbalahap, which armed some 30,000 people and extended their control over much of Luzon.[40] The Americans invaded in 1944–45; the battle for Manila was contested street by street with large numbers of civilians killed. As in most occupied countries, crime, looting, corruption, and black markets were endemic.[41] With a view of building up the economic base of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they try to grow cotton in on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flock to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs. The Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, derris for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and abaca (hemp) for rope. The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program was a failure that gave very little help to Japanese industry, and diverted resources needed for food production.[42] As Karnow reports, Filipinos ""rapidly learned as well that \'co-prosperity\' meant servitude to Japan\'s economic requirements."" [43] Living conditions were bad throughout the Philippines during the war. Transportation between the islands was difficult because of lack of fuel. Food was in very short supply, with sporadic famines and epidemic diseases[44][45] The Japanese tried to remove all Western and American cultural influences. They met fierce resistance when they tried to undermine the Catholic Church by arresting 500 Christian missionaries. The Filipinos came to feel morally superior to the brutal Japanese and rejected their advances.[46] Newspapers and the media were tightly censored. The Japanese tried to reshape schools and impose the Japanese language. They formed neighborhood associations to inform on the opposition.[47] Britain\'s total mobilization during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a ""people\'s war"" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.[48][49] Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.[50] Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.[51] The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control.[52] In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals, and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasized, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the farm labor force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women\'s Land Army.[53] Parents had much less time to supervise their children, and there were fears of juvenile delinquency, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all young people over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organizations available to them.[54] In mid-1940, the RAF (Royal Air Force) was called on to fight the Battle of Britain but it had suffered serious losses. It lost 458 aircraft—more than current production—in France and was hard pressed. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They were: Wellingtons, Whitley Vs, Blenheims, Hurricanes and Spitfires. These aircraft received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labor was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September—more than enough to cover the losses—and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.[55] Starting in 1941, the US provided munitions through Lend lease that totaled $15.5 billion[56] Food, clothing, petrol, leather and other items were rationed. However, items such as sweets and fruits were not rationed, as they would spoil. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew ""victory gardens"", and small home vegetable gardens. Many things were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for nitroglycerin production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally-sourced unrationed products than people in cities, and were more able to grow their own. The rationing system, which had been originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government\'s imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal ""national loaf"". Surveys of public opinion showed that most Britons were pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.[58] From very early in the war, it was thought that the major industrial cities of Britain, especially London, would come under Luftwaffe air attack; this did happen with The Blitz. Some children were sent to Canada, the USA and Australia and millions of children and some mothers were evacuated from London and other major cities to safer parts of the country when the war began, under government plans for the evacuation of civilians, but they often filtered back. When the Blitz bombing began on September 6, 1940, they evacuated again. The discovery of the poor health and hygiene of evacuees was a shock to many Britons, and helped prepare the way for the Beveridge Report. Children were evacuated if their parents agreed; but in some cases they had no choice. The children were only allowed to take a few things with them, including a gas mask, books, money, clothes, ration book and some small toys.[59][60] Belfast in Northern Ireland was a representative British city that has been well studied by historians.[61][62] It was a key industrial city producing ships, tanks, aircraft, engineering works, arms, uniforms, parachutes and a host of other industrial goods. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.[63] As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city for example. The Northern Ireland government under Richard Dawson Bates (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was too distant. When Germany conquered France in spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city\'s fire brigade was inadequate, there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After seeing the Blitz in London in the autumn of 1940, the government began the construction of air raid shelters. The Luftwaffe in early 1941, flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Especially hard hit were the working class areas in the north and east of the city where over a thousand were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city afraid of future attacks. The bombing revealed the terrible slum conditions. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, closing it for six months. Apart from the numbers of dead, the Belfast blitz saw half of the city\'s houses destroyed. Approximately twenty million pounds worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticized heavily for its lack of preparation. The criticism forced the resignation of Northern Ireland\'s Prime Minister J. M. Andrews. The bombing raids continued until the invasion of Russia in the summer of 1941. The American army arrived in 1942–44, setting up bases around Northern Ireland, and spending freely. An Emergency Hospital Service was established at the beginning of the war, in the expectation that it would be required to deal with large numbers of casualties. A common theme called for an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices [64] The goal was operationalized in a famous report by William Beveridge  It recommended that the various income maintenance services that a grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.[65] The themes of equality and sacrifice were dominant during the war, and in the memory of the war. Harris points out that the war was seen at the time and by a generation of writers as a period of outstanding national unity and social solidarity. There was little antiwar sentiment during or after the war. Furthermore, Britain turned more toward the collective welfare state during the war, expanding it in the late 1940s and reaching a broad consensus supporting it across party lines. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, historians were exploring the subtle elements of continuing diversity and conflict in  society during the war period.[66] For example, at first historians emphasized that strikes became illegal in July 1940, and no trade union called one during the war. Later historians pointed to the many localized unofficial strikes, especially in coal mining, shipbuilding, the metal trades, and engineering, with as many as 3.7 million man days lost in 1944.[67] The BBC collected 47,000 wartime recollections and 15,000 images in 2003-6 and put them online.[68] The CD audiobook Home Front 1939–45 also contains a selection of period interviews and actuality recordings.[69] Canada joined the war effort on September 10, 1939; the government deliberately waited after Britain\'s decision to go to war, partly to demonstrate its independence from Britain and partly to give the country extra time to import arms from the United States as a non-belligerent.[70] War production was ramped up quickly, and was centrally managed through the Department of Munitions and Supply. Unemployment faded away. Canada became one of the largest trainers of pilots for the Allies through the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Many Canadian men joined the war effort, so with them overseas and industries pushing to increase production, women took up positions to aid in the war effort. The hiring of men in many positions in civilian employment was effectively banned later in the war through measures taken under the National Resources Mobilization Act.. Shipyards and repair facilities expanded dramatically as over a thousand warships and cargo vessels were built, along with thousands of auxiliary craft, small boats and others.[71] Canada expanded food production, but shipped so much to Britain that food rationing had to be imposed. In 1942 it shipped to Britain 25 per cent of total meat production (including 75% of the bacon), 65% of the cheese and 13% of the eggs.[72] Since 20% of Canada\'s population were not of British or French origin, their status was of special concern. The main goal was to integrate the marginalized European ethnicities—as opposed to the First World War policy of internment camps for Ukrainians and Germans. In the case of Germany, Italy and especially Japan, the government watched the ethnics closely for signs of loyalty to their homelands. The fears proved groundless.[73] In February 1942 21,000 Japanese Canadians were rounded up and sent to internment camps that closely resembled similar camps in the US because the two governments had agreed in 1941 to coordinate their evacuation policies.[74] Most had lived in British Columbia, but in 1945 they were released from detention and allowed to move anywhere in Canada except British Columbia, or they could go to Japan. Most went to the Toronto area.[75][76] Canadian women responded to urgent appeals to make-do, recycle and salvage in order to come up with needed supplies. They saved fats and grease; gathered recycled goods, handed out information on the best methods to use that one may get the most out of recycled goods and organized many other events to decrease the amount of waste. Volunteer organizations led by women also prepared packages for the military overseas or for prisoners of war in Axis countries. With World War II came the dire need for employees in the workplace, without women to step-in, the economy would have collapsed. By autumn 1944 the number of women working full-time in Canada\'s paid labor force was twice what it had been in 1939, and that figure of between 1,000,000 and 1,200,000 did not include part-time workers or women working on farms.""[77] Women had to take on this intensive labor and while they did this they still had to find time to make jam, clothes and other such acts of volunteering to aid the men overseas. The government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia\'s industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Australian and American armed forces. There were a few Japanese attacks, most notably on Darwin in February 1942, along with the widespread fear in 1942, that Australia would be invaded. Australia entered the war in 1939 and sent its forces to fight the Germans in the Middle East (where they were successful) and Singapore (where they were captured by the Japanese in 1942). By 1943, 37% of the Australian GDP was directed at the war effort. Total war expenditure came to £2,949\xa0million between 1939 and 1945.[78] The Curtin Labor Government took over in October 1941, and energized the war effort, with rationing of scarce fuel, clothing and some food. When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the danger was at hand, and all women and children were evacuated from Darwin and northern Australia. The Commonwealth Government took control of all income taxation in 1942, which gave it extensive new powers and greatly reduced the states\' financial autonomy.[79] Manufacturing grew rapidly, with the assembly of high performance guns and aircraft a specialty. The number of women working in factories rose from 171,000 to 286,000.[80] The arrival of tens of thousands of Americans was greeted with relief, as they could protect Australia where Britain could not. The US sent in $1.1 billion in Lend Lease, and Australia returned about the same total in services, food, rents and supplies to the Americans.[81] New Zealand, with a population of 1.7 million, including 99,000 Maori, was highly mobilized during the war. The Labour party was in power and promoted unionization and the welfare state. The armed forces peaked at 157,000 in September 1942; 135,000 served abroad, and 10,100 died. Agriculture expanded, sending record supplies of meat, butter and wool to Britain. When American forces arrived, they were fed as well. The nation spent £574 million on the wear, of which 43% came from taxes, 41% from loans and  16% from American Lend Lease. It was an era of prosperity as the national income soared from £158 million in 1937 to £292 million in 1944. Rationing and price controls kept inflation to only 14% during 1939–45.[82][83] Montgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women, especially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional female jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and reversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and many women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change in gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since the 1920s.[84][85] During World War II, India was a colony of Britain known as British Raj. Britain declared war on behalf of India without consulting with Indian leaders.[86] This resulted in resignation of Congress Ministries.[87] The British recruited some 2.5 million Indian volunteers, who played major roles as soldiers in the Middle East, North Africa, and Burma in the British Indian Army. India became the main base for British operations against Japan, and for American efforts to support China. In Bengal, with an elected Muslim local government under British supervision, the cutoff of rice imports from Burma led to severe food shortages, made worse by maladministration. Prices soared and millions starved because they could not buy food. In the Bengal famine of 1943, three million people died.[88] A small anti-British force of about 40,000 men (and a few women) formed in Southeast Asia, the Indian National Army (INA) under Subhas Chandra Bose. It was under Japanese army control and performed poorly in combat. Its members were captured Indian soldiers from British Indian Army who gained release from extreme conditions in POW camps by joining the Japanese-sponsored INA. It participated in Battle Of Kohima and Battle of Imphal. In postwar Indian politics, some Indians called them heroes. The Congress Party in 1942 demanded immediate independence, which Britain rejected. Congress then demanded the British immediately ""Quit India"" in August 1942, but the Raj responded by immediately jailing tens of thousands of national, state and regional leaders; knocking Congress out of the war. Meanwhile, the Muslim League supported the war effort and gained prestige and membership, as well as British support for its demands for a separate Muslim state (which became Pakistan in 1947). Hong Kong was a British colony captured by Japan on December 25, 1941, after 18 days of fierce fighting. The conquest was swift, but was followed by days of large-scale looting; over ten thousand Chinese women were raped or gang-raped by the Japanese soldiers.[89] The population halved, from 1.6 million in 1941 to 750,000 at war\'s end because of fleeing refugees; they returned in 1945.[90] The Japanese imprisoned the ruling British colonial elite and sought to win over the local merchant gentry by appointments to advisory councils and neighborhood watch groups. The policy worked well for Japan and produced extensive collaboration from both the elite and the middle class, with far less terror than in other Chinese cities. Hong Kong was transformed into a Japanese colony, with Japanese businesses replacing the British. However, the Japanese Empire had severe logistical difficulties and by 1943 the food supply for Hong Kong was problematic. The overlords became more brutal and corrupt, and the Chinese gentry became disenchanted. With the surrender of Japan the transition back to British rule was smooth, for on the mainland the Nationalist and Communists forces were preparing for a civil war and ignored Hong Kong. In the long run the occupation strengthened the pre-war social and economic order among the Chinese business community by eliminating some conflicts of interests and reducing the prestige and power of the British.[91] Germany had not fully mobilized in 1939, nor even in 1941. Not until 1943, under Albert Speer (the minister of armaments in the Reich), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production. Instead of using all available Germans, it brought in millions of foreign workers from conquered countries, treating them badly (and getting low productivity in return).[92] Germany\'s economy was simply too small for a longer all-out war. Hitler\'s strategy was to change this by a series of surprise blitzkriegs. This failed with defeats in Russia in 1941 and 1942, and against the economic power of the allies.[93] Instead of expanding the economies of the occupied nations, the Nazis seized the portable machinery and rail cars, requisitioned most of their industrial output, took large quantities of food (15% of French output), and forced the victims to pay for their military occupation.[94] The Nazis forced 15 million people to work in Germany (including POWs); many died from bad living conditions, mistreatment, malnutrition, and executions. At its peak, forced laborers comprised 20% of the German work force and were a vital part of the German economic exploitation of the conquered territories. They were especially concentrated in munitions and agriculture.[95] For example, 1.5 million French soldiers were kept in POW camps in Germany as hostages and forced workers and, in 1943, 600,000 French civilians were forced to move to Germany to work in war plants.[96] Although Germany had about double the population of Britain (80 million versus 40 million), it had to use far more labor to provide food and energy. Britain imported food and employed only a million people (5% of the labour force) on farms, while Germany used 11 million (27%). For Germany to build its twelve synthetic oil plants with a capacity of 3.3 million tons a year required 2.4 million tons of structural steel and 7.5 million man-days of labor. (Britain imported all its oil from Iraq, Persia and North America). To overcome this problem, Germany employed millions of forced laborers and POWs; by 1944, they had brought in more than five million civilian workers and nearly two million prisoners of war—a total of 7.13 million foreign workers. Rationing in Germany was introduced in 1939 immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities. Hitler was at first convinced that it would affect public support for the war if a strict rationing program was introduced. The Nazi popularity was in fact partially due to the fact that Germany under the Nazis was relatively prosperous, and Hitler did not want to lose popularity or faith. Hitler felt that food and other shortages had been a major factor in destroying civilian morale during World War I which led to defeatism and surrender. Despite the rationing, civilians had sufficient amounts of food and clothing; witness Howard K. Smith later wrote that ""[f]or a people engaged in a life-and-death war ... the German people for two years of war ate amazingly well."" The meat ration, for example, was 500g per week per person. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, however, this changed to 400g per week, then fell further. Estimating that the meat ration had dropped by up to 80% in five months of fighting in Russia, and citing many other changes in living conditions that suddenly occurred, Smith wrote that by the time he left Germany in late 1941, ""for the first time ... the German people are undernourished"".[97] The system gave extra rations for men involved in heavy industry, and extremely low starvation rations for Jews and Poles in the areas occupied by Germany, but not to the Poles inside Germany many of whom had been brought in to perform heavy labor in German war industries. The amounts available under rationing were sufficient to live from, but clearly did not permit luxuries. Whipped cream became unknown from 1939 until 1948, as well as chocolates, cakes with rich crèmes etc. Meat could not be eaten every day. Other items were not rationed, but simply became unavailable as they had to be imported from overseas: coffee in particular, which throughout was replaced by substitutes made from roasted grains. Vegetables and local fruit were not rationed; imported citrus fruits and bananas were unavailable. In more rural areas, farmers continued to bring their products to the markets, as large cities depended on long distance delivery. Many people kept rabbits for their meat when it became scarce in shops, and it was often a child\'s job to care for them each day. By the spring of 1945, food distribution and the ration system was increasingly in collapse due to insurmountable transportation disruption and the rapid advance of the Allied armies from west and east with consequent loss of food storage facilities. In Berlin, during the beginning of the Battle of Berlin, the authorities announced the allocation of a special supplementary food ration on April 20, 1945. It consisted of a pound of bacon or sausage, half a pound of rice, half a pound of peas or pulses, a pound of sugar, four ounces of coffee substitute, one ounce of real coffee, and a tin of vegetables or fruit. Additionally, the authorities announced that standard food ration allocations for the next fortnight could be claimed in advance.[99] The extra allocation of rations were dubbed by Berliners Himmelfahrtsrationen, Ascension-day rations, ""Because with these rations we shall now ascend to heaven""[100] Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown nurses, and absorbed one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killing of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.[101] Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male doctors and medics. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.[102] The conquest of Germany in 1945 freed 11 million foreigners, called ""displaced persons"" (DPs)- chiefly forced laborers and POWs. In addition to the POWs, the Germans seized 2.8 million Soviet workers to labor in factories in Germany. Returning them home was a high priority for the Allies. However, in the case of Russians and Ukrainians returning often meant suspicion or prison or even death. The UNRRA, Red Cross and military operations provided food, clothing, shelter and assistance in returning home. In all, 5.2 million were repatriated to the Soviet Union, 1.6 million to Poland, 1.5 million to France, and 900,000 to Italy, along with 300,000 to 400,000 each to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Belgium.[103] In 1944–45, over 2.5 million ethnic Germans fled from Eastern Europe in family groups, desperately hoping to reach Germany before being overtaken by the Russians.[104][105] Half a million died in the process, the survivors were herded into refugee camps in East and West Germany for years. Meanwhile, Moscow encouraged its troops to regard German women as targets for revenge. Russian Marshal Georgi Zhukov called on his troops to, ""Remember our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our wives and children tortured to death by Germans....We shall exact a brutal revenge for everything."" Upwards of two million women inside Germany were raped in 1945 in a tidal wave of looting, burning and vengeance.[106] The Japanese home front was elaborately organized, block by block, with full-scale food rationing and many controls over labor. The government used propaganda heavily and planned in minute detail regarding the mobilization of manpower, identification of critical choke points, food supplies, logistics, air raid shelters, and the evacuation of children and civilians from targeted cities. Food supplies were very tight before the heavy bombing began in fall 1944, then grew to a crisis. There was only a small increase of 1.4 million women entering the labor force between 1940 and 1944. The minister of welfare announced, ""In order to secure its labor force, the enemy is drafting women, but in Japan, out of consideration for the family system, we will not draft them.""[107] The weaknesses in the maximum utilization of womanpower was indicated by the presence of 600,000 domestic servants in wealthy families in 1944. The government wanted to raise the birthrate, even with 8.2 million men in the armed forces, of whom three million were killed. Government incentives helped to raise the marriage rate, but the number of births held steady at about 2.2 million per year, with a 10% decline in 1944–45, and another 15% decline in 1945–46. Strict rationing of milk led to smaller babies. There was little or no long-term impact on the overall demographic profile of Japan.[108] The government began making evacuation plans in late 1943, and started removing entire schools from industrial cities to the countryside, where they were safe from bombing and had better access to food supplies. In all 1.3 million children were moved—with their teachers but not their parents.[109] When the American bombing began in earnest in late 1944, 10 million people fled the cities to the safety of the countryside, including two-thirds of the residents of the largest cities and 87% of the children. Left behind were the munitions workers and government officials. By April 1945, 87% of the younger children had been moved to the countryside. Agricultural production in the home islands  held up well during the war until the bombing started. It fell from an index of 110 in 1942 to 84 in 1944 and only 65 in 1945. Worse, imports dried up.[112] The Japanese food rationing system was effective throughout the war, and there were no serious incidences of malnutrition. A government survey in Tokyo showed that in 1944 families depended on the black market for 9% of their rice, 38% of their fish, and 69% of their vegetables.[113] The Japanese domestic food supply depended, however, on imports, which were largely cut off by the American submarine and bombing campaigns. Likewise there was little deep sea fishing, so that the fish ration by 1941 was mostly squid harvested from coastal waters. The result was a growing food shortage, especially in the cities. There was some malnutrition but no reported starvation.[114]  Despite government rationing of food, some families were forced to spend more than their monthly income could offer on black market food purchases. They would rely on savings or exchange food for clothes or other possessions.[115] The American aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities took from 400,000 to 600,000 civilian lives, with 100,000+ in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. The Battle of Okinawa resulted in 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths. In addition civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000. The total of Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war and were caused by starvation or severe malnutrition in garrisons cut off from supplies.[117] Health and living conditions worsened after the surrender in September 1945. Most of the housing stock in large cities was destroyed, just as refugees tried to return from the rural areas. Adding to the crisis there was an influx of 3.5 million returning soldiers and 3.1 million Japanese civilians forcibly repatriated from Imperial outposts in Manchuria, China, Indochina, Formosa, Korea, Saipan and the Philippines; about 400,000 civilians were left behind and not heard of again. Meanwhile, 1.2 million Koreans, POWs and other non-Japanese left Japan. The government implemented pro-natalist policies, which led to an increase in the marriage rate, but birth rates remained steady until they declined by 10% in the stress of the last year of the war, and another 15% during the hardship of the postwar period.[118] The American bombing campaign of all major cities severely impacted the economy, as did the shortages of oil and raw materials that intensified when Japanese merchant shipping was mostly sunk by American submarines. When industrial production was available to the military, for example, 24 percent of Japan\'s finished steel in 1937 was allocated to the military, compared to 85 percent in 1945.[119] By the end of the war, output percent of the highest capacity was still 100 percent for steel, although only 75 percent for aluminum, 63 percent for machine tools, 42 percent for vacuum tubes, 54 percent cement, 32 percent cotton fabric, and 36 percent for wool.[120] Severe food shortages were common throughout the war zones, especially in Europe where Germany used starvation as a military weapon. Japan did not use it as a deliberate policy, but the breakdown of its transportation and distribution systems led to famine and starvation conditions among its soldiers on many Pacific islands.[121] Bose (1990) studies the three great Asian famines that took place during the war: Bengal in India, Honan in China, and Tonkin in Vietnam. In each famine at least two million people died. They all occurred in densely populated provinces where the subsistence foundations of agriculture was failing under the weight of demographic and market pressures. In each cases famine played a role in undermining the legitimacy of the state and the preexisting social structure.[122] A great deal of housing was destroyed or largely damaged during the war, especially in the Soviet Union,[123] Germany, and Japan. In Japan, about a third of the families were homeless at the end of the war.[124] In Germany, about 25% of the total housing stock was destroyed or heavily damaged; in the main cities the proportion was about 45%.[125] Elsewhere in Europe, 22% of the prewar housing in Poland was totally destroyed; 21% in Greece; 9% in Austria, 8% in the Netherlands; 8% in France, 7% in Britain, 5% Italy and 4% in Hungary.[126]', '', '', 'In one sense, the meeting of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill was a logical culmination of some fifteen months of ardent wooing of America by the British. As soon as he took office in May 1940, Churchill launched a campaign to bring the United States into the war on Britain\'s side. Gradually, Roosevelt and the American people responded to Churchill\'s plea to have the ""New World"" come to ""the rescue of the Old."" Via such steps as the destroyer-bases deal, Roosevelt\'s commitment to make America the ""Arsenal of Democracy,"" and Lend-Lease, the United States adopted a pro-British and anti-Nazi stance. But Churchill and his advisors wanted more—full scale American participation in the war and quickly before the British public\'s resolve to fight on gave way to despair. The events of spring–summer 1941 revealed that President Roosevelt was not yet prepared to take that epochal decision for war. The President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty\'s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world. Eighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments. Franklin D. Roosevelt Winston S. Churchill Long after the circumstances that led to the August 1941 meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill had faded into the mists of memory, the Atlantic Charter remained a live issue. Dismissed by Berlin and such collaborators as Vichy France as ""mere propaganda,"" the unrealistic ravings of advocates of a discredited ideology, the Charter nonetheless fired the imagination of men and women throughout the world. Hitler appears already to have concluded that the United States was in the war, and some scholars go so far as to suggest that his violent reaction against the Atlantic Charter contributed to his executing the final solution of the Jewish problem. He had promised that should the war become a world war, the outcome would be the destruction of European Jewry. He kept his word. Viewed by its creators as an assertion of aspirations for those nations that fought the Axis, the Charter became the vehicle of Allied Powers war aims and the guiding manifesto that led directly to the establishment of the United Nations. Though the charter was officially no more than a press release by the leader of a belligerent power and the head of a neutral nation, the U.S. Department of State\'s listing of treaties still in force includes the Atlantic Charter and identifies as its signatories all of the adherents to the Declaration by the United Nations. As a result, the Atlantic Charter is in the early twenty-first century considered a pivotal document in the struggle to achieve acceptance of universal principles of human rights and justice.

It was a joint statement by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882–1945; served 1933–45) of the United States and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (1874–1965) of Great Britain. The charter reflected their countries’ eight common objectives for a postwar world. The objectives emphasized the different philosophies of the two democracies and the other main Allied power, the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt hoped the charter would encourage support in the United States for entering the war alongside the Allies . The Atlantic Charter was written during a secret meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill when the United States was still technically a neutral country. It was becoming clear to Roosevelt that the United States would probably enter the war soon, so the meeting covered many issues concerning the war. Churchill was not convinced of the need for a joint declaration, but he introduced ideas in a draft statement. A number of points proved to be controversial, but at the end of the meeting a final statement was formed. The ideas it contained would prove to be highly important in guiding Allied initiatives throughout the war and in establishing postwar peace. The Atlantic Charter included eight basic points. It set forth the concept that each country should have the right of self-determination. This meant that territorial changes would happen only with the approval of the people concerned. Furthermore, each country would be allowed to establish the government of its choosing. Both powers declared that they sought no territorial gains from the war. Other points reflected their hopes for a world in which all nations would have access to trade and prosperity. They included thoughts on a new system of international security that would allow freedom of the seas, encourage fewer arms, and reduce fear in the world. The Atlantic Charter was welcomed in both countries. Its importance, however, became clear only after the United States entered the war. The Charter helped define Allied goals when it was included as part of the Declaration by the United Nations in January 1942. Twenty-six nations embraced the aims of the Atlantic Charter when they signed the Declaration by the United Nations. That number eventually doubled. The Atlantic Charter had a significant impact on the postwar world. The notion of an international system of security prompted the formation of the United Nations (UN), created in 1945. By grounding itself in the declaration of 1942, the UN embraced the principles of the Atlantic Charter. The right of self-determination thus became a guiding principle in international politics. In the thirty years following the war, important transfers of political power happened throughout the world. With encouragement from the Atlantic Charter, many countries were motivated to establish their independence from outside rule.

Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Great Britain at a meeting in Argentia Bay off the coast of Newfoundland. The United States, still technically neutral in World War II, had already taken a number of steps that brought it closer to war. The charter resembled President Woodrow Wilson\'s Fourteen Points in that both declarations expressed idealistic objectives for a postwar world. The charter included the following points: the renunciation of territorial aggrandizement; opposition to territorial changes not approved by the people concerned; the right of people to choose their own form of government; equal access to trade and raw materials of the world; promotion of economic advancement, improved labor standards, and social security; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and disarmament of aggressor nations pending the establishment of a permanent system of peace. Although only a press release as first issued, the charter was nonetheless well understood to be a pronouncement of considerable significance. It acquired further authority when, on 1 January 1942, twenty-six countries (including the United States and Great Britain) signed the United Nations Declaration, which included among its provisions formal endorsement of the charter.

Roosevelt and British prime minister Winston Churchill in 1941, echoed Woodrow Wilson\'s Fourteen Points and called for the rights of self-determination, self-government, and free speech for all peoples. The charter stipulated that at the end of World War II, all Allied nations could determine their own political destinies. Many African and Asian nationalists capitalized on the promise of the Atlantic Charter to argue for political independence from colonial control. The President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty\'s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world. Eighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measure which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.

Prior to U.S. entry into World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill, the prime minister of Great Britain. Together the two leaders issued the Atlantic Charter, a broadly conceived statement affirming the two nations\' solidarity in the face of impending threats to international security. The Atlantic Charter cited the rights of all nations to self-determination and ""the abandonment of the use of force"" in international disputes. The charter was eventually approved by all members of the United Nations, including the countries of Latin America, for whom the charter\'s repudiation of aggression and insistence on unrestricted free travel on the seas bore particular significance.

Roosevelt of the United States and Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Great Britain held secret meetings aboard warships in the North Atlantic off the coast of Canada. World War II had begun in Europe nearly two years earlier, and Churchill sought assistance from the United States to combat German aggression. At the conclusion of their conference the two leaders issued the Atlantic Charter, a joint declaration, drafted by Churchill, that stated British-American goals for the postwar world. The charter stated that (1) neither nation sought any aggrandizement; (2) they desired no territorial changes without the free assent of the peoples concerned; (3) they respected every people’s right to choose their own form of government and wanted sovereign rights and self-government restored to those forcibly deprived of them; (4) they would try to promote equal access for all states to trade and raw materials; (5) they hoped for worldwide collaboration to promote improved living standards; (6) they would seek a postwar peace in which all nations could live with security within their boundaries; (7) peace should enable all people to traverse the oceans and seas without hindrance; and (8) all nations should abandon the use of force to settle disputes. The Atlantic Charter was subsequently incorporated into the Declaration of the United Nations on Jan. 1, 1942 (see United Nations, “Origin of the United Nations”).

The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war -- no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, self-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations.

For most Christians, Sunday is observed as a day of worship and rest, holding it as the Lord\'s Day and the day of Christ\'s resurrection. Sunday is a day of rest in most Western countries, part of \'the weekend\'. In some Muslim countries and Israel, Sunday is the first work day of the week.  According to the Hebrew calendars and traditional Christian calendars, Sunday is the first day of the week, and according to the International Organization for Standardization ISO 8601 Sunday is the seventh and last day of the week. No century in the Gregorian calendar starts on a Sunday, whether its first year is considered to be \'00 or \'01. The Jewish New Year never falls on a Sunday. (The rules of the Hebrew calendar are designed such that the first day of Rosh Hashanah will never occur on the first, fourth, or sixth day of the Jewish week; i.e., Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday). Sunday, being the day of the Sun, as the name of the first day of the week, is derived from Hellenistic astrology, where the seven planets, known in English as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, each had an hour of the day assigned to them, and the planet which was regent during the first hour of any day of the week gave its name to that day. During the 1st and 2nd century, the week of seven days was introduced into Rome from Egypt, and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day. The third season of Stargate Atlantis, an American-Canadian television series, began airing on July 21, 2006 on the US-American Sci Fi Channel. The third season concluded after 20 episodes on February 5, 2007 on the Canadian The Movie Network. The series was developed by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, who also served as executive producers. Season three regular cast members include Joe Flanigan, Torri Higginson, Jason Momoa, Rachel Luttrell, Paul McGillion, and David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay. Sunday was an Australian current affairs, arts and politics program, broadcast nationally on Sunday mornings on the Nine Network Australia. The program covered a range of topical issues including local and overseas news, politics, and in-depth stories on Australia and the world, plus independent film reviews, independent arts features, and independent music reviews. Its final show was aired on Sunday, 3 August 2008. The announcement of the launch of the private and independent breakfast television and Canberra-produced politics program on 22 October 1981 inspired controversy, as it was then practice to fill the spot with religious programming. The advent and ongoing success of Sunday was a significant milestone in Australian television, as it for the first time offered a credible alternative/rival to the dominant influence of the ABC\'s flagship current affairs program Four Corners, which had premiered 20 years earlier. Sunday was often referred to as the ""baby"" of network boss Kerry Packer, although rival media outlets have characterised it as ""an expensive indulgence"".', '', 'Sunday is a day of rest in most Western countries, part of ‘the\xa0weekend’.

When I was little; it was the day when I went – with my younger brother – to Sunday school. Dressed up in our finest, we would be taken to the small school behind the church and there, be given biscuits and squash. [I don’t know why that is the first memory I have of the place. Perhaps it the fact we so rarely had biscuits at home]. We were allowed to play and draw and listen to stories. Stories from the bible. That’s what I remember. At some point, and I do not know why, we stopped going \xa0to Sunday school. Instead, it became more of a family day. Dad would take me and bro out and we would go visit our grandparents in the morning. Return home in time for a sunday roast and perhaps a walk in the afternoon. The evening was always cut short, as it was school the following morning. My brother and I were shooed off to bed earlier than normal, somewhere around seven o’clock. As we got older, the walking and trips out become more frequent and we would take packed lunches or a primus stove to heat up beans and tea. Progressing into the late teens and it was more a case of lazing in bed after a late night out on the Saturday. With the inevitable shout up the stairs to “..get out of bed as lunch was on the table!” Into adulthood and our own children, Sunday has always been a day where we did something as a family together. A walk. A trip to the seaside. A walk along the River Thames. Always something special. Never a work day. A day of reconnection. Now as the children have grown up and spend their time with their horse at the horse yard, Sunday has become the one day of the week where I can be in a reflective space. Quiet. Thoughtful. I think of the week that has occurred and the week to come. I do not worry about either. It is yet being present and accepting what has happened and what will be. All too quickly will the day be over and the work week commence. However, till then, I wish you all a reflective Sunday. Oh and for Mum’s everywhere, Happy Mothering Sunday. By the way, this is my 100th article. Hope you enjoyed it. Would love to hear your memories of a Sunday; what you did growing up; and what you do now. “By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.” Notify me of new comments via email.

The new Sugar Act replaced the Molasses Act of 1733, reducing by half the colonial tax on molasses, but stepping up enforcement of the tax. The Sugar Act not only affected molasses but expanded the diversity of goods that could be taxed. Sugar, wine, and essentially all sugar products, as well as clothing, were to be taxed and strictly enforced. In 1773 the British Parliament passed the Molasses Act. This act levied a tax on all molasses that was being imported into the colonies from islands in the West Indies; which were not British colonies. Prior to the passage of the Molasses Act, the colonist would get molasses from all islands of the West Indies, including those possessed by the French, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese. Molasses was an important ingredient in the colonial era. It is a byproduct of sugar cane refinement and has many uses. It was the number one source of sweetener in the world, up until the 1880s and essential for the distillation of rum. The rum industry in the West Indies was one of its major sources of income. It was essential in the slave trade between the Colonies, the Indies, and Africa. The problem with molasses was created due to the fact that the non-British West Indian islands were better producers of sugar cane, and therefore molasses. Those islands were able to produce more molasses and thus were capable of selling it at a lower cost to the American colonists. The non-British West Indian islands were also better trading partners. The British islands refused to purchase colonial exports such as fish, lumber, and flour because they did not need it, the non-British islands were in need of these items. The colonist was also prohibited from trading with the British West Indies in grain or livestock because it would compete with Great Britain’s market, therefore they were sold to the non-British islands. Due to these factors; refusal to buy products; outlawing the sale of others; and the higher price of molasses; the purchase of molasses from the British West Indies became virtually non-existent. After complaints about this, the British passed the Molasses Act of 1733 which, did not forbid the purchase of molasses from non-British isles but levied a tax upon all molasses imported into the colonies from non-British isles. The enforcement of the Molasses Act was difficult, if not non-existent. The colonist found numerous loopholes in the way the tax was enforced. Such ways around the law included going to ports off route and unloading the products bought in the non-British West Indies prior to reaching their destination and thus avoiding the tax collector. The colonists would also alter markings on products indicating their point of origin and even bribe tax collection officers. This law proved to be completely unmanageable but remained in effect until 1763 when the Act expired. Due to Great Britain’s involvement in the French and Indian War, known in American history as the Seven Years War, the British suffered an enormous amount of debt. In addition, due to the French and Indian War, the British Empire felt it essential to keep a standing army in the colonies, not only to protect from invasion but to enforce laws against the American colonists. The Molasses Act of 1733 had just expired a year earlier and the British Empire decided to renew the tax but with some changes. Therefore Parliament passed the Sugar Act of 1764. It was the first tax enacted by the British against the colonists for the purpose of raising revenue. The Sugar Act created a new tax on molasses imported from non-British isles along the same lines as the Molasses Act but the tax was reduced by half. Even though the theoretical cost was diminished the Sugar Act required explicit enforcement. In addition to molasses, the tax was levied on foreign-made coffee, sugar, pimento, and wine. It also limited the quantity of lumber and iron that the colonists were permitted to export to those islands. In addition, the Sugar Act created a new court system for which evaders of the law were to be tried. Enforcement of the Molasses Act was difficult, part of it stems from the fact that any individuals tried for suspected smuggling of molasses was prosecuted in the colonies by a jury of their peers. The jurors, who were colonists themselves, were always sympathetic to the smugglers and guilty verdicts, no matter how damning the evidence was non-existent. Under the Sugar Act, the suspected smugglers were brought prosecuted in Admiralty Court in Nova Scotia and removed any possibility of having a favorable jury. The Admiralty Courts, despite being inconvenient and removing sympathetic colonists from the jury pool, were also corrupt. A judge on a smuggling case was able to receive 5% of the worth of the cargo if he was able to find the defendant guilty of the smuggling charge. In addition, the colonists themselves had to pay their own expenses to get to Nova Scotia for their own trials. For these, and many other reasons, the Sugar Act became a deterrent to illegal smuggling and helped reduce trade between the Colonies and the rest of the western world. The effects of the Sugar Act of 1764 were immediate and widespread. Because the colonists were forced to pay more for molasses, they were also forced to pay higher prices for rum, and therefore exports of the product diminished. In addition, the Sugar Act established the British West Indies as their only serious export. As a result the demand for rum greatly outweighed the supply that was available to the colonists. In addition, the colonies had no trading partners for other products. . Fully aware of this, the British West Indies were permitted to do whatever they wanted. The prices for molasses, rum, and other native products skyrocketed while the prices for American-made products diminished greatly. They were still forbidden by law to export grain or livestock to the British West Indies and the islands had no use for many of their other products. The Colonies sank into a dramatic recession and the colonists, naturally, blamed their problems on the tax and oppression of the British Empire. As a result of the Sugar Act of 1764 and the resulting economic downturn, the colonists began to, for the first time, openly protest the British Parliament’s intervention in colonial affairs. The colonists were adamant about the idea that Parliament had absolutely no right to levy taxes upon them. This is actually the first time in American history that the phrase “no taxation without representation” is seen. In response to the Sugar, Act colonists formed an organized boycott of luxury goods imported from Great Britain. 50 merchants from throughout the colonies agreed to boycott specific items and began a philosophy of self-sufficiency where they produce those products themselves, especially fabric-based products. The boycott led to the rise of certain individuals who would be leaders in the revolutionary war such as Samuel Adams and James Otis. In addition to the boycott, the Massachusetts Colonial Legislature formed a committee to address the matter which resulted in the drafting of a letter to Parliament to address the frustration and arguments against the Sugar Act. Following the initial letter, drafted by Samuel Adams, many other letters were sent from different committees. All in total 50 letters were delivered to Parliament in response to the Sugar Act. The Sugar Act was effectively repealed in 1765 due to the overwhelming anger from the colonists. However, the British Parliament instead imposed what is known as the Stamp Act. The Stamp Act of 1765 required that all paper products used in the colonies had to contain a stamp that signified that it was legal tender. The products included newspapers, magazines, playing cards, etc. It was a lucrative proposition for the British because there was guaranteed revenue and little to no enforcement was necessary. If a document was to be deemed legal, in the eyes of the British government, it had to have a stamp. To Read the Sugar Act of 1764 please go tohttps://www.historycentral.com/documents/Sugar.html']","The Sugar Act, also known as the American Revenue Act or the American Duties Act, was a revenue-raising act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain on April 5, 1764. The preamble to the act stated: ""it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this Kingdom ... and ... it is just and necessary that a revenue should be raised ... for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same."" The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, which had imposed a tax of six pence per gallon of molasses, had never been effectively collected due to colonial evasion. By reducing the rate by half and increasing measures to enforce the tax, the British hoped that the tax would actually be collected. These incidents increased the colonists' concerns about the intent of the British Parliament and helped the growing movement that became the American Revolution."

Kelly Overton stars as Vanessa Helsing who wakes up to discover the world has been overrun by vampires.\xa0 ‘Van Helsing’ is based on the graphic novel series ‘Helsing’ and is not connected to the 2004 Universal action movie starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale.\xa0\xa0Jonathan Scarfe,\xa0Christopher Heyerdahl,\xa0David Cubitt,Vincent Gale,\xa0Rukiya Bernard,\xa0Trezzo Mahoro,\xa0Laura Mennell and\xa0Paul Johansson also star.\xa0 Neil LaBute created the series and contributes as showrunner and writer. “I couldn’t be happier to learn that Syfy has renewed Van Helsing for a Season 3—it has been a wonderful journey thus far, but we have much more of the ‘Van Helsing’ saga to tell before we’re through.\xa0 It’s great to be working with Syfy on this project again, along with Chad and Mike at Nomadic and all the others at Dynamic and Echo Lake as well. The writing team has some amazing adventures planned for our cast and a few new surprises as well—expect blood to be spilled and characters to die screaming while the fate of humanity slips closer and closer to the edge of true chaos and utter darkness.” Universal had plans to reboot their ‘Van Helsing’ as part of their Dark Universe film series, but that appears to have stalled.\xa0 So for the time being, Syfy’s series may be the only monster-fighting narrative along these lines. Syfy recently cancelled several of their original shows, including ‘Blood Drive’, ‘Dark Matter’ and ‘Killjoys’, while it just premiered the surreal new series ‘Happy’ and has other ambitious projects in the works including George R.R. Martin’s ‘Nightflyers’, the Superman prequel ‘Krypton’, an update of ‘Tremors’ and an adaptation of the comic book ‘Deadly Class’. Jax's earliest memory is of watching 'Batman,' followed shortly by a memory of playing Batman & Robin with a friend, which entailed running outside in just their underwear and towels as capes.  When adults told them they couldn't run around outside in their underwear, both boys promptly whipped theirs off and ran around in just capes."", 'The latest issue of Shueisha‘s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine revealed Monday that\xa0Kohei Horikoshi’s My Hero Academia manga will receive an anime film that will premiere Summer 2018. The film will feature a brand-new story and will be supervised by the original creator himself. Horikoshi-san will also provide the original character designs. There is an additional comment from Horikoshi-san in the issue that states the movie will show the previously unrevealed past of a certain character. The film will feature the students of Class A. My Hero Academia launched it’s manga series back in July 2014, and instantly became a huge hit. It is currently one of the most popular series’ in Weekly Shonen Jump, and released its 16th standalone volume in November. MHA has inspired two television series, the first of which aired in April 2016. A third season has already been announced and will premiere in Spring 2018.', 'Update: A third season has been confirmed, and production is set to begin in late March 2018. Series star Will McCormack, who will direct the season premiere, confirmed that it will air exclusively on Netflix (as opposed to Netflix partnering with Showcase in Canada). The first season of the Canadian series, Travelers, aired on Netflix over the holidays in 2016 and provided a welcome sci-fi surprise that was the perfect balm for that time of year: It had a great premise, a likable cast, and compelling storylines that were complex but not complicated. It was escapist, but not dumb. It was binge-watching candy with a great hook — sending the consciences of people in the future into the bodies of people in the present seconds before they died — but it never sacrificed on character to serve the bigger story. Season two returned again over the holidays and provided mostly more of the same, although the second season deepened the mythology and stripped it largely of the case-of-the-week episodes. I found the latter aspect somewhat disappointing, because part of the allure of Travelers is watching people from the future take over the bodies of those in the present and attempt to integrate into their new lives with families they don’t know and jobs with which they are unfamiliar. I mean, the best part of every episode of Quantum Leap was watching Sam Beckett look into a mirror and come to terms with his new identity. Oh boy. But the second season more than made up for that loss by bringing in the always excellent Enrico Colantoni (Veronica Mars), who plays a more convincing than I might have imagined villain by the name of Vincent Ingram. There is no Keith Mars in this character. He is cold and calculating. Ingram is the original Traveler, sent as a test subject to the World Trade Center on 9/11. He was meant to die when the Towers fell, but he couldn’t bring himself to make that sacrifice, so he escaped and used his knowledge of the future to make millions playing the stock market. Advances in technology, however, made it progressively more difficult for him to escape the notice of The Director who could — with a simple phone call — kill Ingram with some supersonic noise that would give him an aneurysm (something both Ingram’s business partner and wife learned when they answered a phone call meant for him). Naturally, Ingram took out his anger on our favorite group of Travelers and ultimately hatched a plan to escape The Director’s detection. Meanwhile, while dealing with the overarching storyline (which also includes a rebellious sect of Travelers called The Faction), each of the major characters continue to confront drama in their own adopted lives. Again, the relationship between Marcy and David proves to be the most compelling — after having her memories erased, will Marcy fall back in love with David? (Yes, of course!) Also, can we just replace Chris Pratt with Patrick Gilmore? No one would know. Carly continues to experience challenges with her abusive husband while trying to maintain custody of their child; Trevor has to deal with the fact that his host body was sexually abused — along with many others — by his football coach; and Grant MacLaren (Erick McCormick) has to endure his wife’s pregnancy and the subsequent devastating loss of the baby. Loner Philip Pearson (Reilly Dolman) remains probably my favorite character — he’s the historian, and after uploading the rewritten future into his brain, he has to sit with the knowledge of what could happen to his friends even as it is happening. It all comes to a head in a B-A-N-A-N-A-S second season finale that sees Ingram kidnap the loved ones of all the Travelers and tell them that the people they love are not who they think they are. The Travelers, likewise, are forced to admit on video the truth to their loved ones — that they inhabited the bodies of their friends and family members. Those videos are released to the media, and by the end of the episode, the secret is out; the world knows the truth; the Travelers’ loved ones hate them; and Victor Ingram has transferred his conscience to his therapist. And then it’s over. O-V-E-R. Like 70 percent of viewers, I double and triple checked to ensure that there wasn’t a secret, hidden 13th episode. There isn’t. Worse still, Travelers has not officially been renewed for a third season. The series could very well end on a massive cliffhanger (and given Eric McCormick’s Will & Grace schedule, I have to imagine that Travelers takes a backseat). A third season has been confirmed, and production is set to begin in late March 2018. Series star Will McCormack, who will direct the season premiere, confirmed that it will air exclusively on Netflix. Showrunner Brad Wright has also suggested that the theme of season three — like the theme in season four of Black Mirror — would be Artificial Intelligence, and that we may see glimpses of the future. Wright has already mapped out next season. “We know where we’re going,” he said. “It’s not a question of, ‘Oh my God, we’ve painted ourselves into a corner, how do we get out of this?’ We know what we’re doing.” Dustin is the founder and co-owner of Pajiba.

The latest Zombie-Thriller series is set to amaze and scare audiences worldwide. As the release isn’t for a couple more months, here’s everything we know on release date, casting, and the status of a second season. Over the past few years, Korean films like Train to Busan and The Wailing have frightened audiences everywhere. Very much like the Japanese film industry, the Korean film industry has done an amazing job with finding a niche in the horror genre. With the massive success of zombie tv series like The Walking Dead and Z Nation, it was only a matter of time before someone else threw their hat into the ring and get a piece of the action. In the medieval Joseon period of Korea,\xa0a crown prince is sent on a suicide\xa0mission to investigate the origin of a plague ravishing his country. What he finds ultimately threatens the very existence of the Kingdom as an epidemic of Zombies is on the rise. A small list of the cast has been released unfortunately we don’t know all the roles for the actors below. The first season of Kingdom will have 6 episodes full of\xa0guts, gore, and zombie greatness. It’s been hard to find many stills of the show due to Netflix keeping Kingdom firmly under wraps. We were able to find some photos as seen below: While Kingdom may take some level of inspiration for the design of the zombies from Train to Busan, the series from what we know has no relation to the film. Just to clarify the story of Kingdom isn’t a prequel to the origin of the zombie virus from Train to Busan. Rampant is also another Joseon period zombie flick. The film is also made by the studio that produced Train to Busan but has no ties to Kingdom. The teaser for Kingdom has been out for a couple of weeks now, we can expect to see a full trailer closer to the release date. It may seem an obvious statement to say that Kingdom needs to be a success for Netflix. It’s not that we don’t think it will garner an audience, on the contrary, we think the show will be wildly successful but some controversy\xa0has surrounded the production of the show. At the start of 2018, it had been reported by a Korean news site that a member of staff on the art team for Kingdom had sadly died due to overwork. Obviously, this isn’t the fault of Netflix as this appears to be apart of a massive issue with working hours for broadcasters as a whole. To reiterate this isn’t the fault of Netflix as it is with the production studio but a show with the title of ‘Netflix Original’, if anything controversial happens during production this may reflect poorly on Netflix. Kingdom was originally planned to be a limited series of only 8 episodes with a 4-month production. Whereas now the series is being split into two 6 episode seasons and the production\xa0of each episode has cost roughly $1.78 Million. If the size of the audience is large enough then going over budget will be justified. Season one of Kingdom will be premiering worldwide on January 25th, 2019. It’s not very often the second season of a show is commissioned by Netflix\xa0before the release of the first but we can confirm that Kingdom will be returning for a second season!

I will watch, wait & see. I just don’t care about zombies, lucky to see me watch vampires and witches! well maybe I will watch it like you said not before bed time. and a second season you say? really hope this is good then! Kingdom does have an awesome cast. This drama is only available on Netflix. I believe they funded/produced it and it’s not available anywhere else. I’ve seen the trailer and there are some pretty creepy scenes, so be prepared with camomile tea to calm your nerves, ha ha. Let me tell you that some shows on Netflx are so scary and I just can’t watch them. I was never the ‘‘scary type’’  of person.but  I can’t tolerate the zombies movies or dramas. There is one about a girl who turns into a zombie through sx with a guy, and  it has 2 seasons already.  I  tried to watch it but I  got so scared bc it feels so real. Train from Busan I jumped sky high the little pieces of the movie that I  saw, was by skipping the parts I couldn’t handle to watch. today I found one here  the king of blaze  2 parts, seems like, the first part zombies in the act. I have only watched abouit 5 episodes so will wait and see what happens  to the rest. I’m a chicken for scary dramas or movies, but having watched other us zombies series, world war z and train to busan, we found this drama less scary, not scary. [spoiler]- It lacks suspense and thrilling chills, some moments were really long  and sometimes lenghthy, we’re waiting for something to happen, the historical part was king of boring (always the same thing with someone wanting to grab the power, oh surprise it’s this person, like this part was predictable). The bad guy part was kinda boring (I will avenge him…). The queen part was also boring. The characters in the scenario lack depth. The evil intentions… sometimes you feel it not really natural and the same old song. So will watch the s2 for the siege, the zombies resolution, the dvp of crown prince and for the nurse.[/spoiler] I’m watching the KINGDOM drama  right now and all I do is jumping and screaming.']","A third season has also been announced, scheduled to begin production in February of 2018."
