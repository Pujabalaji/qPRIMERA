led zeppelin houses of the holy album cover meaning,"['(Me): Well, I would’ve loved to share the song “The Crunge” today on Facebook, but the Houses of the Holy cover was so disgusting that it rendered the entire operation lurid. I mean what’s actually UP with that cover? I’ll check out Wikipedia, my fact checking cuz. They’re always coming with some sociologically tenacious levity lacing their objective fact. Maybe I’ll get some perspective on other people’s reactions. It would have been an even more radical cover back in the day. Ah, there’s even a section of the blurb on “Artwork and packaging.” Wow, one stop shopping… no further research should even be necessary! Hooray for Wikipedia! Ok here we go. (Wikipedia): The cover art for Houses of the Holy was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke’s novel Childhood’s End. The cover is a collage of several photographs which were taken at the Giant’s Causeway, Northern Ireland, by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. This location was chosen ahead of an alternative one in Peru which had also been considered. (Wikipedia): The photo shoot featured two children, Stefan and Samantha Gates. It was a frustrating affair over the course of ten days. (Me): Why, did they not let you sick fu**s pork them in the a** or something? The flat tone of this blurb about the Houses of the Holy “art” is the most repugnant thing I’ve seen since I first saw a girl wearing yoga pants in a public place (which was my cousin, very awkwardly and unfortunately enough). (Wikipedia): Shooting was done first thing in the morning and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. (Me): Haha, good lord. It’s an album with a song called “The Rain Song” on it, ruined because of“constant rain and clouds.” What will happen next? Also that’s probably longer than Nirvana took for the entire writing and recording of Bleach. (Wikipedia): The photos of the two children were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results were unsatisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created a suitable album cover. (Me): Umm… excuse me… er… kind sir… uh… bearfu**er… um… IT’S A BUNCH OF NAKED FIVE YEAR OLD GIRLS CLIMBING UP A MOUNTAIN. YOU EVEN SEE ONE OF THE GIRL’S A** CRACK. ALSO JIMMY PAGE HAS A REGRETTABLE HISTORY OF GETTING ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH YOUNGER CO-EDS. ALSO THE BAND IN THE FINAL SONG “THE OCEAN” EVEN MAKES A LYRICAL REFERENCE TO “A GIRL WHO WON MY HEART / SHE IS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD AND IT’S A REAL FINE WAY TO START”, A SONG WHICH IS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ONLY COMPOUNDED BY THE FURTHER CHILD PROBLEMS ROBERT PLANT WOULD HAVE WITH HIS SON DYING THREE YEARS LATER OF A STOMACH INFECTION. From the way you write this blurb you’d think it was a picture of varnish covering an oaken table in Ohio. (Wikipedia): Page has stated that the album cover was the second version submitted by Hipgnosis. (Me): “Hipgnosis”? I won’t even ask.', 'The web server reported a gateway time-out error.

when was new hampshire founded and by whom,"['New Hampshire  U.S.                 Senator: The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on the division in 1629 of a land grant given seven years previously by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire after the English county of Hampshire, one of the first Saxon shires. Hampshire was itself named after the port of Southampton, which was known previously as simply ""Hampton"". New Hampshire was first settled by Europeans at Odiorne\'s Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) by a group of fishermen from England under David Thompson in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. The settlers built a fort, manor house and other buildings, some for fish processing, on Flake Hill. They called the settlement Pannaway Plantation. In 1623 the English explorer Christopher Levett, an associate of Gorges and a member of the Council for New England, wrote of visiting Thomson at his Pannaway Plantation. The first native New Hampshirite, John Thompson, was born there. (Note: this was the conclusion of several early historians. However, we now know that John Thompson was baptised at St. Andrew\'s Parish in Plymouth, England in 1619.  New Hampshire was one of the original 13 colonies.', 'New Hampshire is a state of the United States of America located in the country\'s Northeastern region. Considered to be part of New England, New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. The colony that became the state of New Hampshire was founded on a land grant given in 1622 by the Council for New England to Captain John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges (who founded Maine). The colony was named New Hampshire after the English county of Hampshire. It was first settled at Odiorne\'s Point in Rye (near Portsmouth) by a group of fishermen from England under David Thompson[1] in 1623, just three years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. The settlers built a fort, manor house and other buildings, some for fish processing, on Flake Hill. They called the settlement Pannaway Plantation. The first native Newhampshireman, John Thompson, was born there. (Note: this was the conclusion of several early historians. However, we now know that John Thompson was baptised at St. Andrew\'s Parish in Plymouth, England in 1619. Most likely the first English child born in New Hampshire was Agnes Hilton, daughter of William Hilton, born at Dover in 1625.) New Hampshire was one of the original 13 colonies. David Thompson had been sent by Mason, to be followed a few years later by Edward and William Hilton. They led an expedition to the vicinity of Dover, which they called Northam. Mason died in 1635 without ever seeing the colony he founded. Settlers from Pannaway,  moving to the Portsmouth region later and combining with an expedition of the new Laconia Company (formed 1629) under Captain Neal, called their new settlement Strawbery Banke. In 1638 Exeter was founded by John Wheelwright. In 1631, Captain Thomas Wiggin served as the first governor of the Upper Plantation (comprising modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham). All the towns agreed to unite in 1639, but meanwhile Massachusetts had claimed the territory. In 1641 an agreement was reached with Massachusetts to come under its jurisdiction. Home rule of the towns was allowed. In 1653 Strawbery Bank petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts to change its name to Portsmouth, which was granted. The relationship between Massachusetts and the independent Newhampshiremen was controversial and tenuous. In 1679 the king separated them, and Upper Plantation became the ""Royal Province"" with John Cutt as governor. They were reunited in 1686 and redivided in 1691. The ""Royal Province"" continued until 1698 when it came once more under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts with Joseph Dudley as Governor. In 1741 New Hampshire returned to its royal provincial status with a governor of its own, Benning Wentworth, who was its governor from 1741 to 1766. New Hampshire was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted with the British rule in the American Revolution. It was the first state to declare its independence in January 1776, meaning that for the following six months until the founding of the United States of America with the Declaration of Independence, New Hampshire was the first post-colonial nation-state in the Americas. The historic attack on New York (now Fort Constitution) helped supply the cannon and ammunition  for the British that was needed for the Battle of Bunker Hill that took place north of Boston a few months later. New Hampshire would raise three regiments for the Continental Army, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd New Hampshire regiments. New Hampshire Militia units would be called up to fight at the Battle of Bunker Hill, Battle of Bonnington, Saratoga Campaign and the Battle of Rhode Island. John Paul Jones\' ship the Sloop-of-war USS Ranger and the frigate USS Raleigh were built in Portsmouth, along with other naval ships for the Continental Navy and privateers to hunt down British merchant shipping. On January 5, 1776, the Provincial Congress of New Hampshire, meeting in Exeter, ratified the first state constitution in the soon-to-be United States, six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Abolitionists from Dartmouth College founded the experimental, interracial Noyes Academy in Canaan in 1835.  Rural opponents of the school eventually dragged the school away with oxen before lighting in ablaze to protest integrated education, within months of the school\'s founding. Abolitionist sentiment was a strong undercurrent in the state, with significant support given the Free Soil party of John P. Hale. However the conservative Jacksonian Democrats usually maintained control, under the leadership of editor Isaac Hill. In 1856 the new Republican Party headed by Amos Tuck produced a political revolution. The post-World War II decades have seen New Hampshire increase its economic and cultural links with the greater Boston region. This reflects a national trend, in which improved highway networks have helped metropolitan areas expand into formerly rural areas or small nearby cities. The replacement of the Nashua textile mill with defense electronics contractor Sanders Associates in 1952 and the arrival of minicomputer giant Digital Equipment Corporation in the early 1970s helped lead the way toward southern New Hampshire\'s role as a high-tech adjunct of the Route 128 corridor. The postwar years saw the rise of New Hampshire\'s political primary for President of the United States, which as the first primary in the quadrennial campaign season draws enormous attention.', 'Smore empowers educators to connect with their community, streamline school communications, and increase engagement.', 'It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try search?', 'Hampshire ( /ˈhæmpʃɪər/ or  /ˈhæmpʃər/; abbreviated Hants) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom outside the metropolitan counties such as the West Midlands. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. The ceremonial county is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. Hampshire is the largest county in South East England and the third largest shire county in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county during the Local Government Act 1972 boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1889, Hampshire was the fifth largest county in England. It now has an overall area of 3,700 square kilometres (1,400\xa0sq\xa0mi),[1] and measures approximately 86 kilometres (53\xa0mi) east–west and 76 kilometres (47\xa0mi) north–south.[2] Hampshire\'s tourist attractions include many seaside resorts, the motor museum at Beaulieu, with national parks in both New Forest and the South Downs (covering some 45% of the county). Hampshire has a long maritime history and two of England\'s largest ports, Portsmouth and Southampton, lie on its coast. The county is famed as home of such writers as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, as well as the birthplace of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Hampshire takes its name from the settlement that is now the city of Southampton. An Old English name for Southampton was Hantum, and references to the county - Southampton and shire - became Hantum plus Scir. This is where the abbreviation Hants originates from. The county was known by the Anglo-Saxons as Hamtunschire and was recorded in the Domesday book as Hantescire.[3]  From 1889 until 1959, the administrative county was named the County of Southampton.[4][5] The chalk downland of the South Downs and southern edges of Salisbury Plain were settled in the neolithic, and these settlers built hill forts such as Winklebury and may have farmed the valleys of Hampshire. Hampshire was part of an area named Gwent or Y Went by the Celts, which also covered areas of Somerset and Wiltshire. In the Roman invasion of Britain, Hampshire was one of the first areas to fall to the invading forces. The southern portion of the county known as the Meon and in particular the valley of the River Hamble was occupied by Jutish tribes from perhaps as early as 495. Later West Saxon migrants absorbed the Jutish tribes within Wessex after 530. Some scholars believe there is evidence to show the traditional county boundaries of Hampshire may date back to the years of the original West Saxon settlement in circa 519. It is likely that both Winchester and Silchester would have fallen to the West Saxons between the years 508 and 514. A later thrust up the Hampshire Avon towards Old Sarum in 519 appears to have been checked by the Britons at Charford. The historian Albany Major in Early Wars of Wessex makes the case that the borders of the traditional county of Hampshire probably match those of the first West Saxon kingdom established by Cerdic and his son. Evidence of this comes from the border between Hampshire and Berkshire which follows generally the line of the Roman road that ran east and west through Silchester, but it is deflected in the north in a rough semicircle in such a way as to include the whole of the district around the town. He argues that the capture of Silchester, of which no record has been passed down to us, was not the work of Mercian Angles but of the West Saxons probably striking north from Winchester and possibly acting in concert with a separate force making its way up the Thames Valley towards Reading. Silchester was left desolate after its fall and it is most improbable that any regard would have been paid to its side of the border had the fixing of the county boundary been made at a later period.[6] Study of the borders between Hampshire and Wiltshire also seem to suggest the West Saxons\' westward advance was checked by about AD\xa0519. This would corroborate the date given in the Annales Cambriae for the crucial British victory at the Battle of Mons Badonicus in AD\xa0517 which is believed to have stopped further Anglo-Saxon encroachments in south-west and midland Britain for at least a generation. Hampshire was one of the first Saxon shires, recorded in 755 as Hamtunscir,[7] but for two centuries represented the western end of Saxon England, as advances into Dorset and Somerset were fought off by the Britons. The name is derived from the port of Southampton which was known previously as simply ""Hampton"". After the Saxons advanced further west Hampshire became the centre of the Kingdom of Wessex, and many Saxon kings are buried at Winchester. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful King Alfred, who stabilised the region in the 9th century. After the Norman Conquest the county was favoured by Norman kings who established the New Forest as a hunting forest. The county was recorded in the Domesday Book divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. Over several centuries a series of castles and forts were constructed along the coast of the Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Roman Portchester Castle which overlooks Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by Henry VIII including Hurst Castle, situated on a sand spit at the mouth of the Solent, Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as Poole and Bristol declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the Mayflower and the Titanic, the latter being staffed largely by natives of Southampton. Hampshire played a crucial role in the Second World War due to the large Royal Navy harbour at Portsmouth, the army camp at Aldershot and the military Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on Salisbury Plain and the Isle of Purbeck. Supermarine, the designers of the Spitfire and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the British Army\'s main permanent camps. Farnborough is a major centre for the Aviation industry. Although the Isle of Wight was traditionally part of Hampshire, it has been administratively independent for over a century, obtaining a county council of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full ceremonial county in 1974. Apart from a shared police force there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, though many organisations still combine Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch also fall within the traditional county of Hampshire, but were transferred to Dorset in the local government reorganisation of 1974.  The boundary was changed again in 1992, when South Tidworth was transferred to Wiltshire. Hampshire was the departure point of some of those later to settle on the east coast of what is now the United States, in the 17th century, giving its name in particular to the state of New Hampshire. The counties of Isle of Wight and Southampton in Virginia reflect the origins of some of the earliest Jamestown settlers.[8] With the exceptions of the unitary authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton, Hampshire is governed by Hampshire County Council based in Winchester, with several non-metropolitan districts beneath it, and for the majority of the county, parish councils or town councils at the local level. The districts of Hampshire are the following: The county also contains two national parks; the first covering the New Forest, and therefore governance of this area is carried out by a national park authority as well as the New Forest District Council, the second the newer national park for the South Downs which covers the chalk downlands from Winchester eastwards which embraces a large number of local authority areas across three counties, Hampshire, West and East Sussex. Hampshire is a relatively affluent county, with a Gross domestic product (GDP) of £32.3\xa0billion in 2005 (£22.4\xa0billion when excluding Southampton and Portsmouth).[9] In 2006, Hampshire had a GDP per capita of £19,300, comparable with the UK as a whole and slightly below the South East England figure of £19,600.[10] Portsmouth and Winchester have the highest job densities in the county, and therefore there is a high level of commuting into the cities. Southampton has the highest number of total jobs and commuting both into and out of the city is high. The county has a lower level of unemployment than the national average, at 1.9% when the national rate was 3.3%, and as of March 2005 has fallen to 1.1%. 39% are employed by large firms, compared with a national average of 42%. Hampshire has a considerably higher than national average employment in high-tech industries, but average levels in knowledge-based industry. 25.21% of the population work in the public sector.[11] Many rural areas of Hampshire have traditionally been reliant on agriculture, though the county was less agricultural than most surrounding counties, and was mostly concentrated on dairy farming. The significance of agriculture as an employer and wealth creator has declined since the first half of the 20th century and agriculture currently employs 1.32% of the population. The New Forest area is a National Park, and tourism is a significant economic segment in this area, with 7.5\xa0million visitors in 1992.[12] The South Downs and the cities of Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchester also attract tourists to the county. Southampton Boat Show is one of the biggest annual events held in the county, and attracts visitors from throughout the country. In 2003 the county had a total of 31\xa0million day visits, and 4.2\xa0million longer stays.[13] The cities of Southampton and Portsmouth are both significant ports, with Southampton handling a large proportion of the national container freight and Portsmouth housing a large Royal Navy base. The docks have traditionally been large employers in these cities, though again mechanisation has forced diversification of the economy. At the Census 2001[14] the ceremonial county recorded a population of 1,644,249, of which 1,240,103 were in the administrative county, 217,445 were in the unitary authority of Southampton, and 186,701 were in Portsmouth. The population of the administrative county grew 5.6% from the 1991 census, Southampton grew 6.2% while Portsmouth remained unchanged, compared with 2.6% for England and Wales as a whole. Eastleigh and Winchester grew fastest at 9% each. The age structure of the population is similar to the national average. 96.73% of residents were white British, falling to 92.37% in Southampton. The significant ethnic minorities are Asian at 1.34% and mixed race at 0.84%. 0.75% of residents were migrants from outside the UK. 73.86% stated their religion as Christianity and 16.86% were not religious. Significant minority religions were Islam (0.76%) and Hinduism (0.33%). The county has a high level of car ownership, with only 15.7% having no access to a private car compared with 26.8% for England and Wales. The county has a lower than average use of trains (3.2% compared with 4.1% for commuting) and buses (3.2% to 7.4%) but a higher than average use of bicycles (3.5% to 2.7%) and cars (63.5% to 55.3%).[15] The school system in Hampshire (including Southampton and Portsmouth) is comprehensive. Geographically inside the Hampshire LEA are twenty four independent schools, Southampton has three and Portsmouth has four. Few Hampshire schools have sixth forms, which varies by district council. There are 14 further education colleges within the Hampshire LEA, including 5 graded as \'outstanding\' by Ofsted: Alton College, Farnborough Sixth Form College, Peter Symonds College, Queen Mary\'s College, and South Downs College There are four universities, namely the University of Southampton, Southampton Solent University, the University of Portsmouth and the University of Winchester (which also had a small campus in Basingstoke until 2011). Hampshire is divided into eighteen parliamentary constituencies. Fourteen of these are represented by Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs), two by the Liberal Democrats and two by Labour. Labour represents the largest urban centre, holding both Southampton constituencies (Test and Itchen). The Liberal Democrats hold Portsmouth South and Eastleigh. The Conservatives represent a mix of rural and urban areas: Aldershot, Basingstoke, East Hampshire, Fareham, Gosport, Havant, Meon Valley, North East Hampshire, North West Hampshire, New Forest East, New Forest West, Portsmouth North, Romsey and Southampton North and Winchester. At the 2009 local elections for Hampshire County Council, the Conservative Party had a 47.72% share of the votes, the Liberal Democrats had 32.89% and Labour 7.07%. As a result, 51 Conservatives, 25 Liberal Democrats, one Labour and one Community Campaign councillor sit on the County Council.[16] Southampton City Council, which is entirely independent, has 26 Conservative, 14 Labour and 8 Liberal Democrat councillors.[17] Portsmouth City Council, also independent, has 23 Liberal Democrat, 17 Conservative and two Labour councillors.[18] Hampshire also has its own County Youth Council (HCYC)[19] and is an independent youth-run organisation. It meets once a month around Hampshire and aims to give the young people of Hampshire a voice. It also has numerous district and borough youth councils including Basingstoke\'s ""Basingstoke & Deane Youth Council"".[20] Along with the Youth council for the Test Valley District, youthExpress. Hampshire has wildlife typical of the island of Great Britain. The River Test has a growing number of otters, although other areas of the county have quite low numbers. There are reports of Wild Boar across the county. The New Forest is known for its ponies, which have free rein over much of the area. One distinguishing feature is that Hampshire has a large free roaming herd of Red Deer, including more than 6,500 stags during busy seasons. The stag population is protected by the government and hunting is prohibited. Hampshire\'s geology falls into two categories. In the south, along the coast is the ""Hampshire Basin"", an area of relatively non-resistant Eocene and Oligocene clays and gravels which are protected from sea erosion by the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight. These low, flat lands support heathland and woodland habitats, a large area of which forms part of the New Forest. The New Forest has a mosaic of heathland, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland habitats that host diverse wildlife. The forest is protected as a national park, limiting development and agricultural use to protect the landscape and wildlife. Large areas of the New Forest are open common lands kept as a grassland plagioclimax by grazing animals, including domesticated cattle, pigs and horses, and several wild deer species. Erosion of the weak rock and sea level change flooding the low land has carved several large estuaries and rias, notably the 16\xa0km (9.9\xa0mi) long[21] Southampton Water and the large convoluted Portsmouth Harbour. The Isle of Wight lies off the coast of Hampshire where the non-resistant rock has been eroded away, forming the Solent. In the north and centre of the county the substrate is the rocks of the Chalk Group, which form Salisbury Plain and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Thames valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is Pilot Hill, which reaches a height of 286\xa0m (938\xa0ft), and lies on the border with West Berkshire. Butser Hill near Petersfield is the second highest point at 271 metres (889\xa0ft) and lies in the South Downs National Park. The highest village in Hampshire is Bentworth, near Alton. The downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects. A large area of the downs is now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Itchen and Test are trout rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. Nestled in a valley on the downs is Selborne, and the countryside surrounding the village was the location of Gilbert White\'s pioneering observations on natural history. Hampshire\'s county flower is the Dog Rose.[22] Hampshire has a milder climate than most areas of the British Isles,[23] being in the far south with the climate stabilising effect of the sea, but protected against the more extreme weather of the Atlantic coast. Hampshire has a higher average annual temperature than the UK average at 9.8 to 12 °C (50\xa0to 54\xa0°F),[24] average rainfall at 741–1060 millimetres (29.2–42\xa0in) per year,[25] and higher than average sunshine at over 1541\xa0hours per year.[26] Hampshire\'s county town is Winchester, a historic city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Wessex and of England until the Norman conquest of England. The port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth were split off as independent unitary authorities in 1997, although they are still included in Hampshire for ceremonial purposes. Fareham, Gosport and Havant have grown into a conurbation that stretches along the coast between the two main cities. The three cities are all university cities, Southampton being home to the University of Southampton and Southampton Solent University (formerly Southampton Institute), Portsmouth to the University of Portsmouth, and Winchester to the University of Winchester (formerly known as University College Winchester; King Alfred\'s College).The northeast of the county houses the Blackwater Valley conurbation, which includes the towns of Farnborough, Aldershot, Blackwater and Yateley and borders both Berkshire and Surrey. Hampshire lies outside the green belt area of restricted development around London, but has good railway and motorway links to the capital, and in common with the rest of the south-east has seen the growth of dormitory towns since the 1960s. Basingstoke, in the northern part of the county, has grown from a country town into a business and financial centre. Aldershot, Portsmouth, and Farnborough have strong military associations with the Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force respectively. The county also includes several market towns: Alton, Andover, Bishop\'s Waltham, Lymington, New Milton, Petersfield, Ringwood, Romsey and Whitchurch. For the complete list of settlements see List of places in Hampshire. Due to Hampshire\'s long association with pigs and boars, natives of the county have been known as Hampshire hogs since the 18th century.[27] Hampshire has literary connections, being the birthplace of authors including Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, and the residence of others, such as Charles Kingsley. Austen lived most of her life in Hampshire, where her father was rector of Steventon, Hampshire, and wrote all of her novels in the county. Hampshire also has many visual art connections, claiming the painter John Everett Millais as a native, and the cities and countryside have been the subject of paintings by L. S. Lowry and J. M. W. Turner. Selborne houses the Oates museum for the explorer Lawrence Oates, and entertainers Peter Sellers, Benny Hill, Carl Barat and Craig David. Hampshire is the home of many orchestras, bands and groups. Musician Laura Marling hails originally from Hampshire. The Hampshire County Youth Choir is based in Winchester, and has had successful tours of Canada and Italy in recent years. The Hampshire County Youth Orchestra (with its associated chamber orchestra and string orchestra) is based at Thornden Hall. The game of cricket was largely developed in south-east England, with one of the first teams forming at Hambledon in 1750, with the Hambledon Club creating many of cricket\'s early rules. Hampshire County Cricket Club today is a successful first-class team, captained by Dimitri Mascarenhas. The main county ground is the Rose Bowl in West End, which has hosted several one day internationals and which, following redevelopment, hosted its first test match in 2011. Notable players include current England batsman Kevin Pietersen. Hampshire have also been captained by former Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne. Hampshire\'s relatively safe waters have allowed the county to develop as one of the busiest sailing areas in the country, with many yacht clubs and several manufacturers on the Solent. The sport of windsurfing was invented at Hayling Island, which is to the south east of the county.[28] Hampshire has several association football teams, including Premier League side Southampton F.C., and League One side Portsmouth F.C. and Football League Two side Aldershot Town F.C.. Portsmouth F.C. and Southampton F.C. have traditionally been fierce rivals. Portsmouth won the FA Cup in 1939 and 2008 and Football League title twice, in 1949 and 1950, but have spent much of the last 50\xa0years outside the top division and at one stage spent two seasons in the Fourth Division (the lowest division in senior football). Southampton, meanwhile, won the FA Cup in 1976, reached the final in 2003 and spent 27 unbroken years in England\'s top division between 1978 and 2005. Aldershot F.C. became members of the Football League in 1932 but never progressed beyond the Third Division, and on 25 March 1992 went into liquidation and were forced to resign from the league. A new football club, Aldershot Town F.C. was formed almost immediately, and started life in Division 3 of the Isthmian League. In 2008 Aldershot Town were crowned the Conference National champions and were promoted into the Football League. Hampshire also has a number of Non League football teams. Basingstoke Town, Eastleigh, Farnborough and Havant & Waterlooville play in the Conference South. Bashley Gosport and AFC Totton play in the Southern Football League Premier Division and Sholing F.C. and Winchester City F.C. play in the Southern Football League Division One South and West.

ITV news covers the county as part of ITV Meridian, though both BBC London and ITV London can be received in northern and eastern parts of the county. Countless commercial radio stations cover the area, and BBC Radio Solent looks after the majority of the county, while BBC Surrey can be heard in the north east. University journalism students also broadcast bulletins for local areas – such as Winol in Winchester. Southampton and Portsmouth support daily newspapers; the Southern Daily Echo and Portsmouth News. The Basingstoke Gazette is published three times a week, and there are a number of other papers that publish on a weekly basis. Southampton Airport, with an accompanying main line railway station, is an international airport situated in the Borough of Eastleigh, close to Swaythling in the city of Southampton. Cross-channel and cross-Solent ferries link the county to the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and continental Europe. The South Western Main Line (operated by South West Trains) railway from London to Weymouth runs through Winchester and Southampton, and the Wessex Main Line from Bristol to Portsmouth also runs through the county as does the Portsmouth Direct Line. The M3 motorway connects the county to London. The construction of the Twyford Down cutting near Winchester caused major controversy by cutting through a series of ancient trackways (the Dongas) and other features of archaeological significance. The M27 motorway serves a bypass for the major conurbations and as a link to other settlements on the south coast. Other important roads include the A3, A31 and A36.The roads in the county are known for their heavy traffic, especially around Southampton and Portsmouth and the M27 and A27. Hampshire formerly had several canals, but most of these have been abandoned and their routes built over. The Basingstoke Canal has been extensively restored, and is now navigable for most of its route, but the Salisbury and Southampton Canal, Andover Canal and Portsmouth and Arundel Canal have all disappeared. Restoration of the Itchen Navigation, linking Southampton and Winchester, primarily as a wildlife corridor, began in 2008.

who is the father of modern codified acting methodology,"['Lee Strasberg (born Israel Strassberg; November 17, 1901 – February 17, 1982) was an American actor, director and acting teacher. He cofounded, with directors Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford, the Group Theatre in 1931, which was hailed as ""America\'s first true theatrical collective"". In 1951, he became director of the non-profit Actors Studio, in New York City, considered ""the nation\'s most prestigious acting school"". In 1969, Strasberg founded the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York City and in Hollywood to teach the work he pioneered. He is considered the ""father of method acting in America,"" according to author Mel Gussow, and from the 1920s until his death in 1982 ""he revolutionized the art of acting by having a profound influence on performance in American theater and movies"". From his base in New York, he trained several generations of theatre and film\'s most illustrious talents, including Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, Montgomery Clift, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and director Elia Kazan. Former student Elia Kazan directed James Dean in East of Eden (1955), for which Kazan and Dean were nominated for Academy Awards. As a student, Dean wrote that Actors Studio was ""the greatest school of the theater the best thing that can happen to an actor"". Playwright Tennessee Williams, writer of A Streetcar Named Desire, said of Strasberg\'s actors, ""They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life."" Directors like Sidney Lumet, a former student, have intentionally used actors skilled in Strasberg\'s ""Method"". Kazan, in his autobiography, wrote, ""He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home.... e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them \'permanent.\'"" Today, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel lead this nonprofit studio dedicated to the development of actors, playwrights, and directors. As an actor, Strasberg is probably best known for his role as gangster Hyman Roth in The Godfather Part II (1974). “You see what you’ve done, don’t you?...

Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic or recreational purposes. Water can enter lakes from a variety of sources including groundwater, runoff from the watershed, surface waters (like streams and rivers) flowing into the lake, and direct precipitation into the lake. Water leaves lakes through groundwater or surface water flow and evaporation. Lakes can be classified into five main lake types based on how water enters and exits the lake. For some lakes, all or most of their water enters the lake through one source (such as groundwater), other lakes may receive water through several sources. The water quality of a lake and species of fish present are significantly influenced by the lake type. These lakes do not have an inlet or an outlet, and only occasionally overflow. As landlocked water bodies, the principal source of water is precipitation or runoff, supplemented by groundwater from the immediate drainage area. Since seepage lakes commonly reflect groundwater levels and rainfall patterns, water levels may fluctuate seasonally. Seepage lakes are the most common lake type in Wisconsin. Seepage lakes frequently have a less diverse fishery because they are not influenced by streams. Seepage lakes also have a smaller drainage area, which may help to account for lower nutrient levels These lakes have no inlet, but do have an outlet. The primary source of water for spring lakes is groundwater flowing into the bottom of the lake from inside and outside the immediate surface drainage area. Spring lakes are the headwaters of many streams and are a fairly common type of lake in northern Wisconsin. These lakes have no inlet, but like spring lakes, have a continuously flowing outlet. Drained lakes are not groundwater-fed. Their primary source of water is from precipitation and direct drainage from the surrounding land. Frequently, the water levels in drained lakes will fluctuate depending on the supply of water. Under severe conditions, the outlets from drained lakes may become intermittent. Drained lakes are the least common lake type found in Wisconsin. These lakes have both an inlet and outlet where the main water source is stream drainage. Most major rivers in Wisconsin have drainage lakes along their course. Drainage lakes support fish populations which are not necessarily identical to the streams connected to them. Drainage lakes usually have higher nutrient levels than many natural seepage or spring lakes. Artificial lakes are human-made bodies of water referred to as impoundments. A lake is considered an impoundment if one-half or more of its maximum depth results from a dam or other type of control structure. An impoundment is considered a drainage lake since it has an inlet and outlet with its principal water source coming from stream drainage. Impoundments may support fish populations which are not necessarily identical to the streams connected to them. Impoundments usually have higher nutrient levels than many natural seepage or spring lakes. Periglacial lake: Part of the lake’s margin is formed by an ice sheet, ice cap or glacier, the ice having obstructed the natural drainage of the land. Subglacial lake: A lake which is permanently covered by ice. They can occur under glaciers, ice caps or ice sheets. There are many such lakes, but Lake Vostok in Antarctica is by far the largest. They are kept liquid because the overlying ice acts as a thermal insulator retaining energy introduced to its underside by friction, by water percolating through crevasses, by the pressure from the mass of the ice sheet above or by geothermal heating below. Glacial lake: a lake with origins in a melted glacier, such as a kettle lake. Artificial lake: A lake created by flooding land behind a dam, called an impoundment or reservoir, by deliberate human excavation, or by the flooding of an excavation incident to a mineral-extraction operation such as an open pit mine or quarry. Some of the world’s largest lakes are reservoirs like Hirakud Dam in India. Endorheic lake, terminal or closed: A lake which has no significant outflow, either through rivers or underground diffusion. Any water within an endorheic basin leaves the system only through evaporation or seepage. These lakes, such as Lake Eyre in central Australia or the Aral Sea in central Asia, are most common in desert locations. Oxbow lake: A lake which is formed when a wide meander from a stream or a river is cut off to form a lake. They are called “oxbow” lakes due to the distinctive curved shape that results from this process. Rift lake or sag pond: A lake which forms as a result of subsidence along a geological fault in the Earth’s tectonic plates. Examples include the Rift Valley lakes of eastern Africa and Lake Baikal in Siberia. Underground lake: A lake which is formed under the surface of the Earth’s crust. Such a lake may be associated with caves, aquifers or springs. Crater lake: A lake which forms in a volcanic caldera or crater after the volcano has been inactive for some time. Water in this type of lake may be fresh or highly acidic, and may contain various dissolved minerals. Some also have geothermal activity, especially if the volcano is merely dormant rather than extinct. Lava lake: A pool of molten lava contained in a volcanic crater or other depression. Lava lakes that have partly or completely solidified are also referred to as lava lakes. Former: A lake which is no longer in existence. Such lakes include prehistoric lakes and lakes which have permanently dried up through evaporation or human intervention. Owens Lake in California, USA, is an example of a former lake. Former lakes are a common feature of the Basin and Range area of southwestern North America. Ephemeral lake, intermittent lake, or seasonal lake: A seasonal lake that exists as a body of water during only part of the year. Shrunken: Closely related to former lakes, a shrunken lake is one which has drastically decreased in size over geological time. Lake Agassiz, which once covered much of central North America, is a good example of a shrunken lake. Two notable remnants of this lake are Lake Winnipeg and Lake Winnipegosis. Epishelf lakes, unique lakes which exist on top of a dense saltwater body and are surrounded by ice. These are mostly found in the Antarctica. Reblogged this on antilandscaper.

Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams."
what is the function of the cerebral association areas,"['The cerebral cortex is joined to various subcortical structures such as the thalamus the basal ganglia, sending information to hem along efferent connections and receiving information from them via afferent connections. Most sensory information is mapped to the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. Olfactory information, nevertheless, passes through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex also called the piriform cortex. The bulk of connections is from one area of the cortex to another, rather than from subcortical areas. Extracortilal afferents supply primary sensor area at the cortical levels, where the input fibers terminate, up to 20% of the synapses but that in other areas and other layers the percentage is likely to be much lower. Just underneath the verbal correct are interconnected subcortical masses of gray matter called basal ganglia ( or nuclei). The Basal ganglia receive input from the substantial nigra of the midbrain and motor areas of the cerebral cortex and transmit signals back to both of these locations. They are involved in motor control. They are found lateral to the thalamus. The components of the basal ganglia are the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus, the nucleus accumbens and, the putamen, The putamen and globus pallidus are also collectively known as the lentiform nucleus since they both form a lens-shaped body. The putamen and caudate nucleus are also collectively called the corpus striatum after their striped appearance.', '', '* I have initiated a new blog for my Brain Manual. You can find it at: brainausersguide.wordpress.com\xa0 Please bear in mind the topic is a huge one and this is only just the beginning. The brain is so complex it’s going to take a very long time indeed to cover all that is does in any useful detail. I hope that with your help and input I can start to put together a very basic (though occasionally highly detailed) Manual for the Human Brain that people can read and hopefully use to improve their understanding of what they do and why they do it and will give them choices in how to improve the parts of their lives they may be having difficulties with, which i am quite sure, for the most part, comes down to how they learned to use their brain, or what their brains were taught, via experience, to do. It has always amazed me that despite the fact every single human has a brain, without which we would be incapable of doing a single thing – not even breathing, we generally have such a poor understanding of it; what it is, what it looks like, how it is made up, how we ‘use’ it every second of our lives (often without even being aware of what it is doing) and particularly how each one of us might learn to use it to our greatest human advantage. There is no manual for a human brain, we simply have trial and error as the most popular way of working out how best to use it. (Some just simply learn how to get it to do a few basic tasks to meet certain personal needs and let it wander off to do whatever it likes the rest of the time). Our brain is possibly the most complex organism in the known Universe and is capable of almost unlimited potential in our lives. Although relatively small in size, representing around 2% of our total body mass at a little over a kilogram (2-3lb) in weight, it contains some 86 billion neuron cells (+/- 10%) and a similar number of non-neuronal cells. Each neuron may be connected to up to\xa010,000\xa0other neurons, passing electro-chemical signals to each other via as many as\xa01,000 trillion\xa0synaptic connections, equivalent by some estimates to a computer with a 1 trillion bit per second processor!¹ It literally controls and processes everything we do, everything we are. From before we leave the womb to shortly after we die (or could be pronounced ‘brain dead’ which is a bit of a ‘fuzzy’ term capable of differing interpretation)! Although the Cerebrum, which is the main part of the brain we normally can see with all the folds and valleys, is the largest part of our brain it only contains about 20% of the neuron cells, while the large majority – 80% – are contained in the smaller cerebellum region tucked in the back and underneath the cerbrum/cortex. (You can just see it sticking out in Fig 2.) Brain structure is very complex having several ‘layers’ and components and specific regions to which certain body and mental function are attributed. Roughly 50% of the brain comprises of nerve cells called Neurons of which there are 5 main types including interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons), and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells are the largest cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system. Glial cells of which there are also 5 main types:\xa0astrocytes (including Bergmann glia), oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells (including tanycytes), radial glial cells and microglia. Astrocytes are the largest of the glial cells. Cerebrospinal fluid acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. There may be other functions it serves but little experimental documentation currently exists on these. Blood cells and blood vessels including a specific form of white blood cells known as Mast cells. Purkinje cells form the heart of the cerebellar circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate even in the absence of the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40 Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10 ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes.[18] Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1 Hz and never at rates much higher than 10 Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed Arguably the cells of most interest in the brain are the neurons. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses.\xa0 The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission. Neurons can transmit and receive electrochemical signals to/from other neurons via a synapse, which allows multiple neurons to form neural pathways,\xa0neural circuits, and large elaborate\xa0network systems, in some ways comparable to computer networks. Unlike a computer however where the circuits are pre-designed and of a fixed nature, neural networks are adaptable and are able to\xa0 change continually, some being created, some reinforced and some reduced/reprogrammed. The brain uses both release of chemicals and electric current to allow the transfer of signals between neurons; there are chemicals that inhibit an action as well as chemicals that stimulate an action and the brain relies upon maintaining the correct balance between these activities and also getting the timing right. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Neuron electrical activity depends upon concentrations of surrounding chemical\xa0\xa0ion solutions of such elements as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. That’s a ‘brief’ description of what the brain is made up of and the sort of internal activity it generally comprises. Let’s now look at the physical structure – where all the various internal structures are located, and learn a few key terms and a short coverage on what roles each one serves. Our brain is built up from 3 main groups of structures. They are the Cerebrum, the Cerebellum and the Brain Stem.\xa0The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, consisting of the outer cerebral cortex\xa0as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In the human brain, the cerebrum is the uppermost region of the central nervous system.. The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain, in humans and other mammals. It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness.\xa0 The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of ‘grey’ matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes² – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes as per Fig 1 above. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum. The cortex directs the conscious or volitional motor functions of the body. These functions originate within the primary motor cortex\xa0and other frontal lobe motor areas where actions are planned. As the name suggests the sensory areas of the Cortex deal with information received from our (5) senses; The senses of sight, hearing, and touch are served by the primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary somatosensory cortex respectively. The association areas are the parts of the cerebral cortex that do not belong to the primary regions. They function to produce a meaningful perceptual experience of the world, enable us to interact effectively, and support abstract thinking and language. The parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes – all located in the posterior part of the cortex – integrate sensory information and information stored in memory. The frontal lobe or prefrontal association complex is involved in planning actions and movement, as well as abstract thought. Globally, the association areas are organized as distributed networks. Each network connects areas distributed across widely spaced regions of the cortex. Distinct networks are positioned adjacent to one another yielding a complex series of interwoven networks. To most people our brain is just the lump of matter encased in our skull – it’s a single organ. The reality however, is that as shown in the previous chapter our ‘one’ brain has many components and can simultaneously perform many different functions – it acts like a number of different organs. It’s most basic functions are the ones we need to keep our body alive and there are quite a number of individual ones that have to be co-ordinated and adequate resources applied to ensure they all work effectively together. Even if our human body is almost totally immobile our brain has to control the operation of: Our breathing – to ensure our lungs draw in Air for the Oxygen gas essential for supplying energy to our cells via our blood circulation system that the brain controls and simultaneously ensures the same blood extracts waste from our cells and transfers it through the lungs as Carbon Dioxide back into the air. (This is known as the Respiration System). Our digestion – besides the oxygen we need to live we also need to consume both food and water, otherwise known as eating and drinking which our gut breaks down so we can absorb the required nutrients our cells need to grow and maintain themselves; in addition we also need to remove waste products other than carbon dioxide from our bodies, both solid and liquid, through the Digestive System. Our balance – whether we are standing on 2 legs, sitting down, on all fours or lying down we need to accurately determine our body position in space and activate muscles and other parts of our body to help us remain in or move from that position. The primary method of determining this is from input from a tiny organs in our inner ears, the semi-circular canals, which are part of the Vestibular System. Our blood circulation – our body’s cells need oxygen and nutrients to survive and the delivery system is the blood and blood vessels which are fed by our pumping mechanism, the Heart. This forms the Circulatory system. ¹ – http://www.human-memory.net/brain_neurons.html ² – Brain research is an ongoing and fluid study and new discoveries are constantly updating older ideas and pictures of the brain.

These association areas work together to allow us to interact effectively with others, give us a meaningful experience of the world, and to support our abilities to use abstract thought and language. These association areas integrate areas of sensory experience and memory in the form of networks that connect areas that are distributed across wide areas of the brain.

However, language is no longer limited to easily identifiable areas. More recent research suggests that the processes of language expression and reception occur in areas other than just those structures around the lateral sulcus, including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and pons."
what is the cross made of on hot cross buns,"[""Soft and with a touch of spices and packed with dried fruit, hot cross buns are usually a Good Friday treat. Skip the cross marked on top and enjoy these buns year round Every year, as Easter approaches my mind start thinking about different Eater bread recipes. Last year I’ve shared with you a recipe for Romanian Easter bread (Pasca) , Italian Easter bread (Pane di Pasqua) and Greek Eater bread (Tsoureki). Well, today we’re visiting the Great Britain to enjoy a cup of tea with their well know Easter bread – Hot Cross Buns. If you have never made a hot cross buns, prepare yourself to have your kitchen filled with an irresistible aroma of fresh-baked bread, spices and sweetness. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom added to the dough give these buns a nice spicy touch, while the sugar and the dried fruit bring sweetness. I’ve read a few stories where the name actually comes from and it seems the most popular story is related to the Anglo-Saxons. The story says they were making the buns in honor of their goddess of light, Eostre, whose day was celebrating in Spring. Other stories include a few superstitions. Hot cross buns baked and served on Good Friday do not spoil or mold during the year. Keeping a bun in your kitchen until next year to ensure all breads will rise and bake perfectly. Other stories advice to keep a bun for medical purposes. Some say, if a piece of the bun is gives to a sick person, they will immediately recover. There are so many stories, I have no idea which one is actually the real one, but it’s sure is fun reading about them. What’s better than reading, is actually making hot cross buns and enjoying them with a cup of tea. Some recipes for hot cross buns suggest marking the cross before baking and filling it with a paste made from flour, water and shortening. Other recipes have the cross marked but filled right after they are baked with a sweet sugary filling. I prefer mine to be marked after they are baked and cooled. You have to keep in mind when making the cross that the buns must be completely cooled. No warmth or the icing will melt. Optional, if you prefer a darker color for your buns, you can brush them with egg wash (egg yolk mixed with few drops of water) before baking or if you prefer a sweet and shiny top, you can brush the buns with a sugar syrup as soon as you take them out of the oven. My preference is to leave the buns plain. I do not brush them either with egg wash or sugar. The sugar added to the dough brings enough sweetness to the dough to give them a nice brownish color once baked.

what is the meaning of quadrant in math,"['Our reference angle calculator is a handy tool for recalculating angles into their acute version. All you have to do is simply input any positive angle into the field, and this calculator will find the reference angle for you. This article explains what a reference angle is, providing a reference angle definition. It will also provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to find a reference angle in radians and degrees, along with a few examples. Keep scrolling, and you\'ll find a graph with quadrants as well! Look at the picture above. Every angle is measured from the positive part of the x-axis to its terminal line (the line that determines the end of the angle) traveling counterclockwise. If you want to find the reference angle, you have to find the smallest possible angle formed by the x-axis and the terminal line, going either clockwise or counterclockwise. Reference angles are useful in trigonometry. If you want to find the sine or cosine of any arbitrary angle, you first have to look for its reference angle in the first quarter. Then you can find the trigonometric function of the reference angle and choose a proper sign. The two axes of a 2D Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions called quadrants. Numbering starts from the upper right quadrant, where both coordinates are positive, and goes in an anti-clockwise direction, as in the picture. Generally, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent) give the same value for both an angle and its reference angle. The only thing that changes is the sign — these functions are positive and negative in various quadrants. Follow the ""All Students Take Calculus"" mnemonic rule (ASTC) to remember when these functions are positive. Make sure to take a look at our law of cosines calculator and our law of sines calculator for more information about trigonometry. Choose your initial angle — for example, 610°. If your angle is larger than 360° (a full angle), subtract 360°. Keep doing it until you get an angle smaller than a full angle. This is the same as finding the modulo. In this example, after subtracting 360°, we get 250°. In this case, 250° lies in the third quadrant. In this case, we need to choose the formula reference angle = angle - 180°. reference angle = 250° - 180° = 70°. If you need a tool to help convert between different units of angle measurements, try out our angle conversion. Yes, each angle has a reference angle. For angles in the first quadrant, i.e., angles less than or equal to 90 degrees, the reference angle is equal to the original angle. The reference angle for 2π is 0. This is because 2π is the same as 0 radians in terms of reference angle, which is in the first quadrant. As such, the references angle is equal to the angle, and is therefore 0. The reference angle for 4π/3 is π/3. 4π/3 is equivalent to 240°, which is in the third quadrant of a circle. As such, the reference angle is equal to the angle minus π, which in this case is π/3.']","The axes of a two-dimensional Cartesian system divide the plane into four infinite regions, called quadrants, each bounded by two half-axes."

The new Busch Stadium is a replacement for the old Busch Memorial Stadium and can be found in central St. Louis.  Due to its central location, there are a number of popular hotels by Busch Stadium, and plenty of Busch Stadium hotels geared specifically toward housing St. Louis Cardinal fans in town to view a game. The new Busch Stadium was first built in 2002, and since has drawn many fans.  For travelers who are making their way to Busch Stadium and St.   Louis specifically for the fun of taking in a St. Louis Cardinals baseball game, Busch Stadium hotels are quite popular.  Busch Stadium hotels tend to be easy to find thanks to Busch Stadium’s central location in downtown St. Louis.  Hotels by Busch Stadium include a number of options in both the high and low ranges.  Since Bush Stadium is in a great location downtown in the city, hotels by Busch Stadium are also located near some of the other popular attractions in St. Louis, including the St. Louis Zoo, the Missouri Botanical Gardens, and the Gateway Arch in Jefferson  Park. Many travelers hoping to find a seat at Busch Stadium will also be looking into options for Busch Stadium seating.  Since the Stadium is quite large, Busch Stadium seating has many different options for places to sit.  With these varying options come different price levels, as well.

The Cardinals' original home ballpark was Sportsman's Park from 1882 to 1892 when they played in the American Association and were known as the Browns. In 1893, the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920. The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field. Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns. In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season. The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium, or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005. It was built as the multi-purpose stadium home of both the baseball Cardinals and the NFL football Cardinals, who are now the Arizona Cardinals. The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium."
who refused his best actor oscar for patton,"['George Campbell Scott (October 18, 1927 – September 22, 1999) was an American stage and film actor, director, and producer. He was best known for his stage work, as well as his portrayal of General George S. Patton in the film Patton, as General Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick\'s Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, and as Ebenezer Scrooge in Clive Donner\'s 1984 film A Christmas Carol. He was the first actor to refuse the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Patton in 1970), having warned the academy months in advance that he would do so on philosophical grounds if he won.  Scott believed that every dramatic performance was unique and could not be compared to others. George Campbell Scott was born in Wise, Virginia, the son of Helena Agnes (née Slemp; 1904–1935) and George Dewey Scott (1902–1988).[1] His mother died just before his eighth birthday, and he was raised by his father, an executive at Buick. Scott\'s original ambition was to be a writer like his favorite author, F. Scott Fitzgerald; while attending Redford High School in Detroit, he wrote many short stories, none of which was ever published. As an adult, he tried on many occasions to write a novel, but was never able to complete one to his satisfaction.[2] Scott joined the United States Marine Corps, serving from 1945 to 1949. He was assigned to 8th and I Barracks in Washington, DC, in which capacity he taught English literature and radio speaking/writing at the Marine Corps Institute. His primary duty, however, was as an honor guard for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. He later said his duties at Arlington led to his drinking.[3] After his military service, Scott enrolled in the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism and then became interested in drama. His first public appearance on stage was as the barrister in a university production of Terence Rattigan\'s The Winslow Boy, directed by H. Donovan Rhynsburger. During rehearsals for that show, he made his first stage appearance—in a student production of Noël Coward\'s  Hands Across the Sea, directed by Jerry V. Tobias. He graduated from the university in 1953 with degrees in English and theater.[4] Scott first rose to prominence for his work with Joseph Papp\'s New York Shakespeare Festival. In 1958, he won an Obie Award for his performances in Children of Darkness (in which he made the first of many appearances opposite his future wife, actress Colleen Dewhurst), for As You Like It, and for playing the title character in William Shakespeare\'s Richard III (a performance one critic said was the ""angriest"" Richard III of all time).[5] He was on Broadway the following year, winning critical acclaim for his portrayal of the prosecutor in The Andersonville Trial by Saul Levitt. This was based on the military trial of the commandant of the infamous Civil War prison camp in Andersonville, Georgia. His performance earned him a mention in Time. In 1970, Scott directed a highly acclaimed television version of this same play. It starred William Shatner, Richard Basehart, and Jack Cassidy, who was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as the defense lawyer in this production. Scott continued to appear in and sometimes direct Broadway productions throughout the 1960s. The most commercially successful show in which he worked was Neil Simon\'s Plaza Suite (1968). The show was composed of three separate one-act plays all using the same set, with Scott portraying a different lead character in each act; it ran for 1,097 performances. He made many television appearances, including an episode of NBC\'s The Virginian, in the episode ""The Brazen Bell"", in which he recites Oscar Wilde\'s poem ""The Ballad Of Reading Gaol"". That same year, he appeared in NBC\'s medical drama The Eleventh Hour, in the episode ""I Don\'t Belong in a White-Painted House"". He appeared opposite Laurence Olivier and Julie Harris in Graham Greene\'s The Power and the Glory in a 1961 television production.[6] In 1963, Scott starred in the hour-long television drama series East Side/West Side. He portrayed a New York City social worker, along with co-stars Cicely Tyson and Elizabeth Wilson. Scott was a major creative influence on the show, resulting in conflicts with James T. Aubrey, the head of CBS. The Emmy Award-winning program had a series of prominent guest stars, including James Earl Jones. The portrayal of challenging urban issues made attracting advertisers difficult, not helped by the limited distribution.  Not all CBS network affiliates broadcast the show, and it was cancelled after one season.[7] Scott\'s most famous early role was in the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, in which he played General ""Buck"" Turgidson. In later interviews with Stanley Kubrick, Scott was revealed to have initially refused to camp it up on camera. As a compromise, Kubrick had Scott go over the top in rehearsal, assuring Scott that the cameras were off, which was untrue. Kubrick proceeded to use this version in the final cut, which Scott supposedly resented.[8] In 1965, he was cast, under the direction of John Huston, as Abraham with, among others, co-star Ava Gardner cast as Sarah in the Dino de Laurentiis film: The Bible: In the Beginning which was released by 20th Century Fox in 1966.[9] In 1966, Scott appeared as Jud Barker in the NBC western The Road West, starring Barry Sullivan, Kathryn Hays, Andrew Prine, and Glenn Corbett. Scott won wide public recognition in the film Anatomy of a Murder, in which he played a wily prosecutor opposite James Stewart as the defense attorney. Scott was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Scott portrayed George S. Patton in the 1970 film Patton and researched extensively for the role, studying films of the general and talking to those who knew him. Scott refused the Oscar nomination for Patton, just as he had done for his 1962 nomination for The Hustler, but won the award anyway.[10] In a letter to the Motion Picture Academy, he stated that he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors. However, regarding this second rejection of the Academy Award, Scott famously said elsewhere, ""The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don\'t want any part of it.""[3][11] Sixteen years later, in 1986, Scott reprised his role in a made-for-television sequel, The Last Days of Patton. The movie was based on Patton\'s final weeks after being mortally injured in a car accident, with flashbacks of Patton\'s life. At the time the sequel was aired, Scott mentioned in a TV Guide interview that he told the academy to donate his Oscar to the Patton Museum, but since the instructions were never put in writing, it was never delivered.  (The Best Picture Oscar for Patton was given to the George C. Marshall Foundation Library at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, the same institution that generations of Pattons attended, by producer Frank McCarthy a few weeks after the awards ceremony, and is on display there.) Scott did not turn down the New York Film Critics Award (of which his then wife Colleen Dewhurst said, ""George thinks this is the only film award worth having""[12]). He continued to do stage work throughout the rest of his career, receiving Tony Award nominations for his performance as Astrov in a revival of Uncle Vanya (1973), his Willy Loman in a revival of Death of a Salesman (1975), and his performance as Henry Drummond in a revival of Inherit the Wind (1996). In the latter play, he had to miss an unusually large number of performances due to illness, with his role being taken over by National Actors Theatre artistic director Tony Randall.[13] In 1996, he received an honorary Drama Desk Award for a lifetime devotion to theatre. Scott also starred in well-received productions of Larry Gelbart\'s Sly Fox (1976) (based on Ben Jonson\'s Volpone), which ran 495 performances, and a revival of Noël Coward\'s Present Laughter (1982). He frequently directed on Broadway, as well, including productions of All God\'s Chillun Got Wings (1975) and Design for Living (1985), as well as being an actor and director (Death of a Salesman, Present Laughter and On Borrowed Time). In 1971, Scott gave two more critically acclaimed performances, as a de facto Sherlock Holmes in They Might Be Giants and as an alcoholic doctor in the black comedy The Hospital. Despite his repeated snubbing of the academy, Scott was again nominated for Best Actor for the latter role. Scott excelled on television that year, as well, appearing in an adaptation of Arthur Miller\'s The Price, an installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology. He was nominated for, and won, an Emmy Award for his role, which he accepted. Scott also starred in the popular 1980 horror film The Changeling, with Melvyn Douglas. He received the Canadian Genie Award for Best Foreign Film Actor for his performance.[14] In 1981, Scott appeared alongside Timothy Hutton and rising stars Sean Penn and Tom Cruise in the coming-of-age film Taps. In 1982, he was cast as Fagin in the CBS made-for-TV adaptation of Charles Dickens\' Oliver Twist. In 1984, he portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in a television adaptation of A Christmas Carol. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the role. I think I learned to act from people like James Cagney and Paul Muni. And I\'m sure I learned more from Bette Davis than anyone. She has enormous presence, a sense of surprise. She sets you up like a great boxer and BAM! she gives you something else. She does have a certain consistent style, but when you examine her work you find enormous variety of color and intelligence. In 1989, Scott starred in the television movie The Ryan White Story, as Charles Vaughan, the lawyer defending Ryan White from discrimination. In 1990, he voiced Smoke, the villain in the television special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue, and he also voiced the villainous Percival McLeach in Disney\'s The Rescuers Down Under that same year. He was featured in The Exorcist III the same year. In 1997, Scott portrayed Juror #3 in the TV-movie 12 Angry Men, for which he would win another Emmy Award. He hosted the TV series Weapons At War on A&E TV, but was replaced after one season by Gerald McRaney. Weapons At War moved to The History Channel with Scott still credited as host for the first season. Scott was replaced by Robert Conrad after his death in 1999. In 1999, he made his last film, the TV movie Inherit the Wind, portraying Matthew Harrison Brady (ironically opposite the role he had played on stage) with Jack Lemmon as Henry Drummond, with whom he had also worked in 12 Angry Men. Scott had a reputation for being moody and mercurial while on the set. ""There is no question you get pumped up by the recognition,"" he once said, ""Then a self-loathing sets in when you realize you\'re enjoying it.""[15] A famous anecdote relates that one of his stage costars, Maureen Stapleton, told the director of Neil Simon\'s Plaza Suite, ""I don\'t know what to do — I\'m scared of him."" The director, Mike Nichols, replied, ""My dear, everyone is scared of George C. Scott.""[16] He had a daughter, Michelle (born August 21, 1954) with Karen Truesdell. He was an atheist.[17] In 1982, Scott appeared in a campaign commercial for Republican U.S. Senator Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut.[18] Like Weicker, Scott was at that time a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. Scott suffered a series of heart attacks in the 1980s.[19] He died on September 22, 1999, aged 71, of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was buried in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California, in an unmarked grave.', '', '']","He was the first actor to refuse the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Patton in 1970), having warned the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences months in advance that he would do so on philosophical grounds if he won.

According to Antebellum movements in america such as the 3/5 compromise did not expand democratic ideal. They settled property disputes and economic rather than democratic issues. Reform movements in the United States began to expand democratic ideals. For example, the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions drafted in 1798 and 1799 argued that states had the right and the duty to declare unconstitutional any acts of Congress that were not authorized by the Constitution. In doing so, they argued for states' rights and strict constructionism of the Constitution. This is not a valid statement. Many of the reforms made during the antebellum era were not related to democratic ideals at all. For example,  The temperance movement was meant to encourage people to refrain from drinking alcohol. It was dangerous so the goal of the movement was to reduce its consumption, not to expand any democratic ideals. I believe that this statement is true. That many reform movements in the United States did expand democratic ideals. For example the Second Great Awakening which expanded the middle class greatly and created a great strong work ethnic. It lead people to convert to christianity, the lasting legacy of churches and the chance for any individual to amend their lives.

The women's rights movement also include suffrage as seen in the Seneca Falls Convention. The reforms of equal right between women and men were incredibly expanding for democratic ideals. This is a true statement. Many Antebellum movements involved expanded rights for those whose Constitutional rights were being deprived. The Seneca Falls Convention involved a meeting, making an attempt to gain womens' rights. Education reforms were also seen, making attempts to give everybody, regardless of social class, an equal opportunity for an education. Perhaps the most influential movement of the time was The Second Great Awakening. The Second Great Awakening reintroduced evangelical valued back into American life, inspiring a wave of reform movements. These reform movements spread throughout the country, expanding democratic ideals. I believe that this statement is true. Education and woman reforms were few of many to encourage democratic expansion. Inventions also became ideal for democratic expansion, Many Antebellum movements supported the expansion of education and women beliefs.

who stood in front of the tank in tiananmen square,"['Coordinates: 39°54′23.5″N 116°23′59.8″E\ufeff / \ufeff39.906528°N 116.399944°E\ufeff / 39.906528; 116.399944 Tank Man (also known as the Unknown Protester or Unknown Rebel) is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the Chinese military had suppressed the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank\'s attempted path around him.  The incident was filmed and seen worldwide. More than 25 years after the incident, there is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown.[4]  There is at least one witness who has stated that \'Tank Man\' was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest.  Shao Jiang was a student leader and he said, ""I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks.""[5]  Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and videoed, with those images reaching the rest of the world. The incident took place at the north edge of Tiananmen Square, along Chang\'an Avenue, on June 5, 1989, one day after the Chinese government\'s violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests.[6] The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags.[7] As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action.[8] After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse. Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver\'s hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank\'s turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner\'s hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on.  At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leaped in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff. Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way.[8] Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, said it was the Chinese government PSB (Public Security Bureau),[9] while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, Time included the ""Unknown Rebel"" in a feature titled ""Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century"".[10] Little is publicly known of the man\'s identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid the Sunday Express named him as Wang Weilin (王维林), a 19-year-old student[11] who was later charged with ""political hooliganism"" and ""attempting to subvert members of the People\'s Liberation Army.""[12] However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights.[13] One party member was quoted as saying, ""We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison.""[13] Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man\'s identity and current whereabouts.[14] There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President\'s Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, reported that he was executed 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests.[8] In Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have ""no idea who he was either"" and that he\'s still alive somewhere on the mainland. The government of the People\'s Republic of China has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), ""I can\'t confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,"" and then replied in English, ""I think never killed""  [sic].[15] The government also said the actions of the man not coming to harm showed the humility of the country\'s military.[16] In a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Jiang Zemin said, ""He was never arrested."" He then stated, ""I don\'t know where he is now."" He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.[17] Internationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989[13][18] and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of the 20th century.[1][2][3] A PBS interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship.[19] Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China.[13] When undergraduate students at Beijing University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they ""were genuinely mystified.""[20] One of the students said that the image was ""artwork."" It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man that he whispered to the student next to him ""89,"" which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event. It has been suggested that the ""Unknown Rebel,"" if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.[13] At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.[21] Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB.[22] On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.[18] The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both Time and Life magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.[22] The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about half a mile (800\xa0meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter.[23] With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk)  hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot.[24] Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world[22] and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers.[24] He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but didn\'t win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century. Charlie Cole, working for Newsweek and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to Newsweek.[22] Franklin won a World Press Award for a similar photo.[25]  It was featured in Life\'s ""100 Photographs That Changed the World"" in 2003. On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter Terril Jones revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.[26] Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel,[27] but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen.[22] It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener\'s work, they re-checked Wah\'s negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener\'s. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A ""foreign"" photographer accompanying him suddenly said, ""I am not gonna die for your country,"" and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.[27] In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the world. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua, CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer and NBC cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene.[28][29][30] ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony.[31] After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the ""tank man"" incident occurred.[21][32] In Tom Clancy\'s 2000 novel The Bear and the Dragon, the Chinese authorities apprehend and execute Tank Man, then bill the surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head. A fictionalized version of the fate of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in Lucy Kirkwood\'s 2013 play Chimerica.[33] A similar scene is depicted in the music video for Club Foot by the English rock band Kasabian.[34] On 4 June 2013, Sina Weibo, China\'s most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are ""today"", ""tonight"", ""June 4"", and ""big yellow duck"". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a photoshopped version of Tank Man, in which rubber ducks replaced the tanks, had been circulating around Twitter[35] — a reference to Florentijn Hofman\'s Rubber Duck sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong\'s Victoria Harbour.[36]', '']","More than 29 years after the incident, there is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown.

The first influenza pandemic was recorded in 1580; since this time, various methods have been employed to eradicate its cause. The etiological cause of influenza, the orthomyxoviridae was finally discovered by the Medical Research Council (MRC) of the United Kingdom in 1933. In the world wide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, ""Physicians tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and sera (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzae—a name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agent—and several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.""In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens\' eggs was reported by Ernest William Goodpasture and colleagues at Vanderbilt University. The work was extended to growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Frances, Wilson Smith and Macfarlane Burnet, leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines. In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War. Greater advances were made in vaccinology and immunology, and vaccines became safer and mass-produced. Today, thanks to the advances of molecular technology, we are on the verge of making influenza vaccines through the genetic manipulation of influenza genes (see figure 1). Figure 1. Avian flu vaccine development by Reverse Genetics technique. Flu vaccine is usually grown in fertilized chicken eggs (see figure 2). In February preceding each fall\'s flu season (in the Northern hemisphere), three strains of flu are selected and chicken eggs inoculated. As of November 2007, both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs. The European Union has also approved Optaflu, a vaccine produced by Novartis using vats of animal cells. This technique is expected to be more scalable and avoid problems with eggs, such as allergic reactions and incompatibility with strains that affect avians like chickens. A DNA-based vaccination, which is hoped to be even faster to manufacture, is currently in clinical trials, but has not yet been proven safe and effective. Research continues into the idea of a ""universal"" influenza vaccine (but no vaccine candidates have been announced) which would not need to be tailored to work on particular strains, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses. Figure 2. Researchers infect eggs and sort through eggs used for the cultivation of flu vaccine. Vaccines are made the same way they\'ve been made for half a century, relying on tens of millions of chicken eggs to grow the virus. In a 2007 report, the current global capacity of approximately 826 million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the current production of 413 million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8 billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly 2 billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than 3 billion courses would be required to serve these populations. Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population. An effective method of vaccine generation that bypasses the need for eggs is the construction of ""influenza virus-like particle (VLP)"". VLP is a non-egg, non-mammalian cell culture-based vaccine, purified from the supernatants of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells following infection of baculovirus vectors encoding an expression cassette made up of only three influenza virus structural proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix (M1) VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay. Each year, three strains are chosen for selection in that year\'s flu vaccination by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. The chosen strains are the H1N1, H3N2, and Type-B strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season. Due to the high mutation rate of the virus a particular vaccine formulation is effective for at most about a year. The World Health Organization coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. ""The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network was established in 1952. The network comprises 4 WHO Collaborating Centres (WHO CCs) and 112 institutions in 83 countries, which are recognized by WHO as WHO National Influenza Centres (NICs). These NICs collect specimens in their country, perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization. They ship newly isolated strains to WHO CCs for high level antigenic and genetic analysis, the result of which forms the basis for WHO recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere each year."" The Global Influenza Surveillance Network\'s selection of viruses for the vaccine manufacturing process is based on its best estimate of which strains will be predominant the next year, amounting in the end to well-informed but fallible guesswork. Formal WHO recommendations first issued in 1973; beginning 1999 there have been two recommendations per year, one for the northern hemisphere (N) and the other for the southern hemisphere (S).

View here more clinical trials.', 'Influenza vaccines, also known as flu shots, are vaccines that protect against influenza.[2] A new version of the vaccine is developed twice a year as the influenza virus rapidly changes.[2]  While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza.[2][3] They decrease the number of missed days of work by a half day on average.[4] Vaccinating children may protect those around them[2] but the effectiveness of the vaccine in those over 65 years old is unknown because the evidence for this group is poor.[5][6] Both the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nearly all people over the age of 6 months get the vaccine yearly.[2][7][8] This is especially true for pregnant women, children between six months and five years of age, those with other health problems, Native Americans, and those who work in healthcare.[1][2] The vaccines are generally safe. In children fever occurs in between 5 and 10%, as may muscle pains or feeling tired. In certain years, the vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome in older people in about one per million doses. It should not be given to those with severe allergies to eggs or to previous versions of the vaccine. The vaccines come in both inactive and weakened viral forms. The inactive version should be used for those who are pregnant. They come in forms that are injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin.[2] Vaccination against influenza began in the 1930s with large scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945.[9][10] It is on the World Health Organization\'s List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications recommended for a basic health system.[11] The wholesale price in the developing world is about 5.25 USD per dose as of 2014.[12] In the United States it costs less than 25 USD.[13] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the flu vaccine is the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The flu vaccine can also reduce the severity of the flu if a person contracts a strain of the flu that the vaccine did not contain.[14] It takes about two weeks following vaccination for antibodies to protect against the flu.[15] A 2012 meta-analysis found that flu shots were efficacious 67\xa0percent of the time; the populations that benefited the most were HIV-positive adults ages 18 to 55 (76\xa0percent), healthy adults ages 18 to 46 (approximately 70\xa0percent), and healthy children ages 6 to 24 months (66\xa0percent).[16] A vaccine is assessed by its efficacy; the extent to which it reduces risk of disease under controlled conditions, and its effectiveness, the observed reduction in risk after the vaccine is put into use.[17] In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza.[4] Influenza vaccines generally show high efficacy, as measured by the antibody production in animal models or vaccinated people.[18] However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses.[19] However, in most years (16 of the 19 years before 2007), the flu vaccine strains have been a good match for the circulating strains,[20] and even a mismatched vaccine can often provide cross-protection.[21] Trials of both live and inactivated influenza vaccines against seasonal influenza have been summarized in several 2012 meta-analyses. Studies on live vaccines have very limited data, but these preparations may be more effective than inactivated vaccines.[22] The meta-analyses examined the efficacy and effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against seasonal influenza in adults,[4] children,[23] and the elderly.[24][25] The CDC recommend that everyone except children under the age of six months should receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.[7] Vaccination campaigns usually focus special attention on people who are at high risk of serious complications if they catch the flu, such as pregnant women, children over six months, the elderly, and people living with chronic illness or those with weakened immune systems, as well as those to whom they are exposed, such as health care workers.[7][26] As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the household contacts and caregivers of infants should be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant.[26] In children, vaccines again showed high efficacy, but low effectiveness in preventing ""flu-like illness"".[23] In children under the age of two the data are extremely limited, but vaccination appeared to confer no measurable benefit.[23] In the unvaccinated, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu while about 10% of the vaccinated do.[4] Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%.[4] No effect on hospitalization was found.[4] In working adults a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a very modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications.[4]  In healthy, working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons.[5] In health care workers, a 2006 review found a net benefit.[27] Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths.[27]  A 2014 review found benefits to patients when Health Care workers are immunized supported by moderate evidence,[28] based in part on the observed reduction in all-cause deaths in patients whose health care workers were given immunization compared with comparison patients in which the health care workers were not offered vaccine.[29] Evidence for an effect in adults over 65 years old is unclear.[30] Systematic reviews examining both randomized controlled and case control studies found a lack of high-quality evidence.[5][31] Reviews of case control studies found effects against laboratory-confirmed influenza, pneumonia, and death among the community-dwelling elderly.[32][33] The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age.[34] In a non-pandemic year, a person in the United States aged 50–64 is nearly ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than a younger person, and a person over age 65 is over ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than the 50–64 age group.[35] There is a new high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response.[36] Available evidence indicates that the vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine.[37] Vaccinating health care workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.[38][39][40] While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect the elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit.[41] As well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy.[42] The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV.[43] While side effects of the flu vaccine may occur, they are usually minor and the safety of flu vaccines is high. The flu vaccine can cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks of inoculation are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic\'s well-documented toll of illness, hospitalization, and death.[44] Flu vaccination may lead to side effects such as runny nose and sore throat, which can last for up to several days. Egg allergy may also be a concern, since flu vaccines are typically made using eggs;[45][46] however, research into egg-allergy and influenza vaccination[47] has led some advisory groups to recommend vaccine for those with mild allergies and monitored vaccination for those with severe.[48] A large study of nearly 800 children in the UK with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine.[49][50] On January 17, 2013, the U.S. FDA approved Flublok, a faster-turnaround influenza vaccine which is the first grown in insect cells instead of eggs. Since eggs are not used in its production it avoids the problem with egg allergies.[51] Although Guillain–Barré syndrome had been feared as a complication of vaccination, the CDC states that most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with Guillain–Barré.[52][53]  Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to 1 in 10,000) and increases the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately 10 times higher by 2009 estimates).[54][55] Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations,[56] a large study in China, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine covering close to 100\xa0million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 ""swine"" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects; ""The risk-benefit ratio, which is what vaccines and everything in medicine is about, is overwhelmingly in favor of vaccination.""[57][58]  Several studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine,[59] efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger.[60] Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative. Despite some controversy in the media,[61] the World Health Organization\'s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has concluded that there is no evidence of toxicity from thiomersal in vaccines and no reason on grounds of safety to change to more-expensive single-dose administration.[62] TIV induces protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective)[63] based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages.[64] Both types of flu vaccines are contraindicated for those with severe allergies to egg proteins and people with a history of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[69] In 2008, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, the group that advises the Public Health Agency of Canada, recommended that everyone aged 2 to 64 years be encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccination, and that children between the age of six and 24 months, and their household contacts, should be considered a high priority for the flu vaccine.[71] The NACI also recommends the flu vaccine for:[72] In the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6\xa0months.[73][74][75] The U.S. government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. Some U.S. states and hundreds of U.S. hospitals require health-care workers to either get vaccinations or wear masks during flu season. These requirements occasionally engender union lawsuits on narrow collective bargaining grounds, but proponents note that courts have generally endorsed forced vaccination laws affecting the general population during disease outbreaks.[79] In USA\xa0: The CDC has indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, is not recommended for the 2016-2017 flu season, in the United States.[83] Furthermore, health care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons should receive injections (TIV or QIV) rather than LAIV.[84] In a 2010 survey of United States healthcare workers, 63.5% reported that they received the flu vaccine during the 2010–11 season, an increase from 61.9% reported the previous season. US Health professionals with direct patient contact had higher vaccination uptake, such as physicians and dentists (84.2%) and nurse practitioners (82.6%).[85][86][87] Flu vaccine is usually grown by vaccine manufacturers in fertilized chicken eggs.[88][89] In the Northern hemisphere, the manufacturing process begins following the announcement (typically in February) of the WHO recommended strains for the winter flu season.[88][90] Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs inoculated separately, these monovalent harvests are then combined to make the trivalent vaccine.[91] A DNA-based vaccination, which is hoped to be even faster to manufacture, is as of 2011 in clinical trials, determining safety and efficacy.[92] On November 20, 2012, Novartis received FDA approval for the first cell-culture vaccine.[93][94][95] In a 2007 report, the global capacity of approximately 826\xa0million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the production of 413\xa0million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8\xa0billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly 2\xa0billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than 3\xa0billion courses would be required to serve these populations.[96] Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population. Methods of vaccine generation that bypass the need for eggs include the construction of influenza virus-like particles (VLP). VLP resemble viruses, but there is no need for inactivation, as they do not include viral coding elements, but merely present antigens in a similar manner to a virion. Some methods of producing VLP include cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells and plant-based vaccine production (e.g., production in Nicotiana benthamiana). There is evidence that some VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay (HIA).[97] Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are 11 to 12 days old.[98]  The top of the egg is disinfected by wiping it with alcohol and then the egg is candled to identify a non-veinous area in the allantoic cavity where a small hole is poked to serve as a pressure release.[99]  A second hole is made at the top of the egg, where the influenza virus is injected in the allantoic cavity, past the chorioallantoic membrane.  The two holes are then sealed with melted paraffin and the inoculated eggs are incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius.[98] During incubation time, the virus replicates and newly replicated viruses are released into the allantoic fluid  [100] After the 48 hour incubation period, the top of the egg is cracked and the 10 milliliters of allantoic fluid is removed, from which about 15 micrograms of the flu vaccine can be obtained.  At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers.[100] Done on a large scale, this method is used to produce the flu vaccine for the human population. Each year, three strains are chosen for selection in that year\'s flu vaccination by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. The chosen strains are the H1N1, H3N2, and Type-B strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season.  Starting with the 2012–2013 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (coincident with the approval of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), the WHO has also recommended a 2nd B-strain for use in quadrivalent vaccines. The World Health Organization coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network\'s selection of viruses for the vaccine manufacturing process is based on its best estimate of which strains will predominate the next year, amounting in the end to well-informed but fallible guesswork.[102] Formal WHO recommendations were first issued in 1973. Beginning in 1999 there have been two recommendations per year: one for the northern hemisphere (N) and the other for the southern hemisphere (S).[103] Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine are listed in a separate article. Recent WHO seasonal influenza vaccine composition recommendations: The WHO recommends that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses contain the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus.[104] WHO recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing two influenza B viruses should contain the above three viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus.[105] †Strain A(H1N1)pdm09 is a newer name for the strain used in the 2009 flu pandemic vaccine.[106] Vaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Human vaccine is meant unless specifically identified as a veterinary, poultry or livestock vaccine. The first influenza pandemic was recorded in 1580.[107] the cause of influenza, the orthomyxoviridae was discovered by the Medical Research Council (MRC) of the United Kingdom in 1933.[108] † Because of lack of laboratory confirmation and underreporting among other factors, reported cases are ""likely to be a gross underestimation of the true number of fatalities associated with the [2009] pandemic.""[114] The 18,000 cases are those officially confirmed. Two statistical analyses, using different methods but producing similar results, estimated that the actual number was likely to be about ten times higher.[115][116] In the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, ""Physicians tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and sera (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzae—a name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agent—and several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.""[117] In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens\' eggs was reported by Ernest William Goodpasture and colleagues at Vanderbilt University. The work was extended to growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Francis, Jonas Salk, Wilson Smith and Macfarlane Burnet, leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines.[118] In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used in the Second World War.[119] Hen\'s eggs continued to be used to produce virus used in influenza vaccines, but manufacturers made improvements in the purity of the virus by developing improved processes to remove egg proteins and to reduce systemic reactivity of the vaccine.[120]  Recently, the US FDA has approved influenza vaccines made by growing virus in cell cultures[121] and influenza vaccines made from recombinant proteins[122] have been approved, with plant-based influenza vaccines being tested in clinical trials.[123] According to the CDC: ""Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. [...] Vaccination is associated with reductions in influenza-related respiratory illness and physician visits among all age groups, hospitalization and death among persons at high risk, otitis media among children, and work absenteeism among adults. Although influenza vaccination levels increased substantially during the 1990s, further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed"".[124] The egg-based technology (still in use as of 2005) for producing influenza vaccine was created in the 1950s.[125] In the U.S. swine flu scare of 1976, President Gerald Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. Meanwhile, maximum military containment efforts succeeded unexpectedly in confining the new strain to the single army base where it had originated. On that base a number of soldiers fell severely ill, but only one died. The program was canceled, after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as 400 excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, illustrating that vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result has been cited to stoke lingering doubts about vaccination.[126] In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976.[127] Tom Jefferson, who has led Cochrane Collaboration reviews of flu vaccines, has called clinical evidence concerning flu vaccines ""rubbish"" and has therefore declared them to be ineffective; he has called for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.  His views on clinical trials are considered unethical by mainstream medicine and his views on the efficacy of vaccines are rejected by medical institutions including the CDC and the WHO, and by key figures in the field like  Anthony Fauci.[128] The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings.[129]  In the elderly (aged over 65 years) the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination.[130] In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations.[131] The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden,[132] as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine.[133][134] In healthy working adults (aged 18–49 years), a 2012 review found that vaccination was generally not cost-saving, with the suitability for funding being dependent on the willingness to pay to obtain the associated health benefits.[135] In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings.[136] Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it.[137] Influenza research includes molecular virology, molecular evolution, pathogenesis, host immune responses, genomics, and epidemiology. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies and diagnostic tools. Improved influenza countermeasures require basic research on how viruses enter cells, replicate, mutate, evolve into new strains and induce an immune response. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences[138]  that will help us understand what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current vaccine methods are being researched. A different approach is where Internet content is used to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Bing, and proposed a statistical framework which, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the percentage of influenza-like illness in areas, where vaccinations have been performed. Their impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England.[139] The rapid development, production, and distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines could potentially save millions of lives during an influenza pandemic. Due to the short time frame between identification of a pandemic strain and need for vaccination, researchers are looking at novel technologies for vaccine production that could provide better ""real-time"" access and be produced more affordably, thereby increasing access for people living in low- and moderate-income countries, where an influenza pandemic may likely originate, such as live attenuated (egg-based or cell-based) technology and recombinant technologies (proteins and virus-like particles).[140] As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.[141] In September 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.[142] A quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2012.[143][144] Fluarix Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in December 2012.[145] A ""universal vaccine"" that would not have to be designed and made for each flu season in each hemisphere would be useful, in order to stabilize the supply and to ensure against error in the design or escape of the circulating strains by mutation.  Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades.[146] One promising approach is using broadly neutralizing antibodies that unlike the vaccine used today, which provoke the body to generate an immune response, instead provide a component of the immune response itself.  The first neutralizing antibodies were identified in 1993 via experimentation; with time researchers understood that the flu neutralizing antibodies were binding to the stalk of the Hemagglutinin protein; later researchers identified antibodies that could bind to the head of those proteins. Later yet, researchers identified the highly conserved M2 proton channel as a potential target for broadly neutralizing antibodies.[146][147] The challenges for researchers have been identifying single antibodies that could neutralize many subtypes of the virus, so that they could be useful in any season, and that target conserved domains that are resistant to antigenic drift.[146] Another approach has been taking the conserved domains identified from these projects, and delivering groups of these antigens to provoke an immune response; various approaches with different antigens, presented different ways (as fusion proteins, mounted on virus-like particles, on non-pathogenic viruses, as DNA, and others), are under development.[147][148][149] Efforts have also been undertaken to develop universal vaccines that specifically activate a T-cell response, based on clinical data showing that people with a strong, early T-cell response have better outcomes when infected with influenza and because T-cells respond to conserved epitopes.  The challenge for developers is that these epitopes are on internal protein domains that are only mildly immunogenic.[147] Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have been experimenting with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response.[147][150] ""Vaccination in the veterinary world pursues four goals: (i) protection from clinical disease, (ii) protection from infection with virulent virus, (iii) protection from virus excretion, and (iv) serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (so-called DIVA principle). In the field of influenza vaccination, neither commercially available nor experimentally tested vaccines have been shown so far to fulfill all of these requirements.""[151] Horses with horse flu can run a fever, have a dry hacking cough, have a runny nose, and become depressed and reluctant to eat or drink for several days but usually recover in two to three weeks. ""Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of 2 doses, 3–6 weeks apart, followed by boosters at 6–12 month intervals. It is generally recognized that in many cases such schedules may not maintain protective levels of antibody and more frequent administration is advised in high-risk situations.""[152] It is a common requirement at shows in the United Kingdom that horses be vaccinated against equine flu and a vaccination card must be produced; the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) requires vaccination every six months.[153][154] Poultry vaccines for bird flu are made inexpensively and are not filtered and purified like human vaccines to remove bits of bacteria or other viruses. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Purification to standards needed for humans is far more expensive than the original creation of the unpurified vaccine from eggs. There is no market for veterinary vaccines that are that expensive. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. ""Chicken vaccinators who have accidentally jabbed themselves have developed painful swollen fingers or even lost thumbs, doctors said. Effectiveness may also be limited. Chicken vaccines are often only vaguely similar to circulating flu strains — some contain an H5N2 strain isolated in Mexico years ago. \'With a chicken, if you use a vaccine that\'s only 85\xa0percent related, you\'ll get protection,\' Dr. Cardona said. \'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that\'s 99.99\xa0percent related won\'t protect you.\' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. \'Chickens are smaller and you only need to protect them for six weeks, because that\'s how long they live till you eat them,\' said Dr. John J. Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than 1 microgram. \'You have to be careful about extrapolating data from poultry to humans,\' warned Dr. David E. Swayne, director of the agriculture department\'s Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. \'Birds are more closely related to dinosaurs.\'""[155] Researchers, led by Nicholas Savill of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, used mathematical models to simulate the spread of H5N1 and concluded that ""at least 95 percent of birds need to be protected to prevent the virus spreading silently. In practice, it is difficult to protect more than 90 percent of a flock; protection levels achieved by a vaccine are usually much lower than this.""[156] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination.[157] A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.[158] Swine origin influenza virus (SoIV) vaccines are extensively used in the swine industry in Europe and North America. Most swine flu vaccine manufacturers include an H1N1 and an H3N2 SoIV strains. Swine influenza has been recognized as a greater problem since the outbreak in 1976. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine origin flu vaccines are effective in controlling the problem when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.[159] SoIV vaccine manufacture Novartis paints this picture: ""A strain of swine origin influenza virus (SoIV) called H3N2, first identified in the US in 1998, has brought exasperating production losses to swine producers. Abortion storms are a common sign. Sows go off feed for two or three days and run a fever up to 106\xa0°F (41\xa0°C). Mortality in a naïve herd can run as high as 15%.""[160] In 2004, Influenza A virus subtype H3N8 was discovered to cause canine influenza. Because of the lack of previous exposure to this virus, dogs have no natural immunity to this virus. However, a vaccine is now available.[161]', 'JavaScript must be enabled in your browser to display the table of contents. © 2005 - 2023 Speedy Ceus®. All rights reserved.

Manipur has been at the crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange for more than 2,500 years. It has long connected the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, enabling migration of people, cultures and religions. During the Raj, the Kingdom of Manipur was one of the princely states. Between 1917 and 1939, the people of Manipur pressed for their rights against British rule. By the late 1930s, the princely state of Manipur negotiated with the British administration its preference to be part of India, rather than Burma. These negotiations were cut short with the outbreak of World War II. On 21 September 1949, Maharaja Budhachandra signed a Treaty of Accession merging the kingdom into India. This merger has been disputed by groups in Manipur as having been completed without consensus and under duress. The dispute and differing visions for the future has resulted in a 50-year insurgency in the state for independence from India, as well as in repeated episodes of violence among ethnic groups in the state. From 2010 through 2013, the militant insurgency was responsible for the violent death of about 1 civilian per 100,000 people, each year. The world average annual death rate from intentional violence has been 7.9 per 100,000 people. The Meitei ethnic group, represents 53% of the population of Manipur state. The main language of the state is Meitei (also known as Manipuri). Tribes constituting about 20% of the state population are distinguished by dialects and cultures that are often village-based. Manipur’s ethnic groups practice a variety of religions. According to 2011 census, Hinduism is the major religion in the state, closely followed by Christianity. Other religions include Islam, Sanamahism, Buddhism etc. Manipur has primarily an agrarian economy, with significant hydroelectric power generation potential.

A high rate of unemployment exists in Manipur, particularly among the educated youth. According to the Live Register of Employment Exchange, the total number of educated job-seekers were recorded as 5, 83.65 thousands. Manipur is rich in natural resources but due to difficult terrain, inadequate infrastructural facilities and varying climatic conditions, the state could not develop much in the industrial sector of its economy. In the initial stage, Govt. policy in the state was one of revival and revitalization of the traditional handlooms and handicrafts of the local habitats. The contribution of the manufacturing sector to the total gross state domestic product at current prices is found to be 6.17 percent. The trend of industrial development and the present local conditions of the state and in consonance with industrial policy of the Government of India, the Govt. of Manipur in its policy announcement of 1990, has decided to focus attention to the small scale and agro-based industries without discouraging the medium and large-scale industries. It is expected to serve the objective of employment generation and dispersal of industries in rural and urban areas. The state has laid emphasis on creating a strong industrial base and employment opportunities in the state through provision of various growth inducing factors based on locally available resources. It is based on locally available raw materials and minerals. In order to promote rapid industrialization, the State Government has over the years been offering attractive package of incentives and concessions to invigorative industries. The khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) was established by the Govt. of India in the year 1957. The Khadi and Village Industries is not only providing employment to people in rural and semi-urban areas at low investment per job, but also utilizes local skill resources and provides part-time as well as full time work to rural artisans, women and minorities. The traditional sector of industries falls within the purview of organizations such as Khadi and Village Industries Commission. The KVIC include artisans in tiny industrial units and defines it as any industry located in a village or town inhabited by population not exceeding 10000 which produces goods and renders services with or without the use of power in which the fixed capital per head does not exceed Rs.15000. Growth Centres are large villages or small towns which have the potential to become the nuclei for the socio-economic development of the surrounding area. The Growth Centres can be identified by the different orders with respect to the quality and quantity of services and facilities, service area and population. A growth centre of lowest order should have services such as agricultural input centre, primary and middle school, maternity and child care centres and daily market. Small-Scale Industries (SSI) is an important segment of the economy, contributing substantially in the form of production, employment and exports. It has continued to play a vital role in the fulfillment of socio-economic objectives. The principal factor for defining small-scale Industries has always been based on the size of investment. Small-Scale Industries are those industries whose investment in fixed assets such as plants and machineries does not exceed Rs.100.00 lakhs (Rs.1 Crore). Investment in plant and machinery in respect of industry related Small-Scale Service and Business Enterprises (SSSBE) were increased to Rs.10.00 lakhs from Rs.5.00 lakhs. For speedy growth of small-scale industries, the Government has already brought about simplifications in the SSI registration procedures. The State Government has introduced this Policy with various components being offered such as, incentives, improved infrastructure facilities, supply of quality power, and credit flow from Bank and Financial institutions, better market linkages and to boost investor confidence. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 All round economic development and to improve living standards. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Employment opportunities. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Optimal utilization of both natural and physical resources. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Develop adequate infrastructures to ensure planned and accelerated industrial development. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Promote maximum capital investment in the State for economic activities resulting in employment opportunities, improving standard of living of people at large and all-round development of the State. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Promote modernization and technology up-gradation of existing industrial units. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Encourage quality control, standardization and competitiveness of local products. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Promote eco-friendly industries. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Bio-Technology industries. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Floriculture. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Handloom and Handicraft. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Medicinal Plants. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Distillation of oils from aromatic plants. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mineral based industries. •\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Information Technology Trade and Commerce under Export Import mechanisms.

what are poseidon's symbols and what do they mean,"['Trident tattoo designs are usually related to the strength of the gods. The Trident is a mythological and magical weapon in the shape of a three-pointed spear belonging to the gods of the sea. It is a symbol of power over the seas and waters but it is also associated with thunderstorms. In Greek mythology, the trident is connected with Poseidon, the god of the sea. Poseidon and his equivalent in Roman myth, Neptune, used the trident to create water sources, but in anger, he struck the earth causing mighty earthquakes, stir up tidal waves, tsunamis, and sea storms. In Hindu legends, God Shiva used the trident or ‘trishula’ to fight off negativity and evil. The three-pronged sacred weapon represents the deity in his three aspects: Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. The number 3 has also diverse meanings and significances, commonly said to represent various trinities, like creation, maintenance, and destruction or the past, present and future.

what is significant about the canada act of 1982,"[""Since December 2012, Professor Philippe Lagassé and I have put forward some arguments on the nature of the Crown of Canada as a corporation sole and all that this legal concept entails for the royal succession and the emergence of the Crown of Canada as a separate legal entity from the Crown of the United Kingdom. Perhaps we have engaged in a futile academic exercise, but I believe that the historical evidence supports our claims. The Government of Canada in 2013 has acknowledged that the Crown of Canada is a separate legal person relative to the Crown of the United Kingdom; however, the Department of Justice also insists that the preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867 has created a “principle of symmetry” out of the personal union such that the Queen of the United Kingdom automatically becomes the Queen of Canada without any Canadian intervention. In effect, the only Canadian law relating to succession is the preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867. This is a false argument. From the primary and secondary sources that I have gathered thus far, I can make the following hypothesis on why succession to the Crown lost its clear place in Canadian law and in the Constitution of Canada. First, the Trudeau government shifted the constitutional focus from the patriation of the British North America Act and establishing an indigenous amending formula to entrenching a bill of rights. Consequently, most constitutional questions since the 1980s have centered on the Charter, and any talk of amending the constitution has become anathema to Canadian politics since the failure of the Charlottetown Accord in 1992. Canadian political observers even refer to amending the constitution as “opening” the constitution – with the obvious allusion to perils that await those who dare open Pandora’s Box. Second, the Department of Justice and the Privy Council Office lost vital institutional memory and expertise on the nature of the Crown of Canada. I have presented several primary sources on this blog in order to refute the Government of Canada’s main argument that Canada has no law on succession. In fact, Canada has several laws on succession, which now falls under “the office of the Queen” under section 41(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982. In this entry, I present the following documents that complement Prime Minister King’s arguments of January 1937: In a debate on the Foreign Enlistment Act, Justice Minister Lapointe explained to the Commons the status of British statutes under Canadian law on19 March 1937. Prior to 1931, several British statutes automatically applied to Canada as part of Canadian law because the Westminster Parliament exercised legislative sovereignty over the Crown colonies. The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865 gave British statutes paramount force over all colonial statutes; as such, any colonial statutes that were “repugnant to” a British statute automatically became void to the extent of its repugnancy. However, section 2 of the Statute of Westminster repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act and thus gave the self-governing Dominions the power to repeal or amend any Imperial statute that applied as part of their laws. Section 4 of the Statute of Westminster stated that the British Parliament would then only legislate for a Dominion at its request and with its consent. Some scholars, like Andrew Heard and Arthur Berriedale Keith, have interpreted section 4 as a mere “self-denying ordinance,” such that the Westminster Parliament could have continued to legislate for the Dominions even without their request and consent. Strictly speaking, this is true. However, the Dominion Parliament could then simply invoke section 2 of the Statute of Westminster and repeal such a law through whichthe British Parliament claimed the authority to apply to the Dominions outside of the procedure under section 4. This is why the Statute of Westminster did in fact grant the Dominions independence. Lapointe explained: “Under the Statute of Westminster, any dominion may re-enact, repeal, or amend any statute already applying to it.”[1] As such, he introduced a bill to amend the Foreign Enlistment Act, a British statute that applied to Canada as part of its law, which the Parliament of Canada could then amend by virtue of the Statute of Westminster. Lapointe also deemed the Parliament of Canada to have accepted the principle of his bill, because the British statute had already become part of Canadian law as well. Charles Cahan, a Conservative MP and former Minister of the Crown under the Bennett government, agreed with Lapointe’s interpretation. In fact, Cahan went further and added with great enthusiasm that he and Conservative Opposition Leader R. B. Bennett embraced “the purpose and intent of the bill to take additional measures to exercise the rights of nationality and sovereignty which we believe are now inherent in the Parliament of Canada.”[2] King, Lapointe, Bennett, and Cahan would probably all look on what the Harper government did in 2013 with shame and incredulity, because today’s government has denied several decades of history and precedent into to avoid “opening” the Constitution. This is what the Government’s supporters now call a “practical” approach — with the clear implication that Lagassé, Toffoli, and I are mere woolly-browed academics who simply cannot grasp the complexities of modern government. Cahan also noted that in his practice as a lawyer, he “was astonished to find that the judges presiding in the courts had no idea that any such acts [of the British Parliament] were in existence extending to and applicable to Canada.”[3] Sadly, many lawyers and judges today would not cease to astonish Cahan with their ignorance of this subject, mainly because most law schools offer only a superficial overview of Crown law in this post-Charter era. Lapointe and Cahan accurately described the constitutional position as of 1937: the Statute of Westminster had placed the British acts that applied as part of Canadian law under “the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.”[4] While the Parliament of Canada alone could have legislated on this matters between 1931 and 1982, it no longer possesses this authority. Those statutes relating to “the office of the Queen” which then fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Parliament and are now subject to the Constitution Act, 1982. In effect, the Government of Canada wasted the easy opportunity to consolidate Canada’s laws relating to the Crown within those 50 years. Cahan once requested (presumably when he served in the Cabinet) “a return from the Department of External Affairs showing the existing statutes of the parliament of the United Kingdom which extend to this dominion.”[5] He continued, “From my personal research, I have tabulated scores of such statutes which then and still apply to Canada, although under the act of 1867 they are now within the legislative jurisdiction of the parliament of Canada.” Lapointe replied, “I have a list of 150” British statutes that apply to Canada as part of the laws of Canada.[6] Cahan suggested that the Departments of Justice and External Affairs compile an exhaustive list of all British statutes that “extend to and are applicable to Canada,” publish that list, and recommend which acts be repealed and which be retained.[7] Unfortunately, the King Government did not aggressively pursue that policy. While J.E. Read, a government lawyer in the Department of External Affairs, did produce such a list in 1943, neither King nor St. Laurent introduced a bill to rationalize the Imperial laws that Canada had inherited. The Trudeau government also neglected the issue when it patriated the British North America Acts in 1982. Maurice Ollivier served as a law clerk in the House of Commons in the mid-20th century and wrote three books on Canada’s transition from self-governing colony to independent, sovereign state. In Problems of Canadian Sovereignty, he included an appendix of “Enactments of the Parliament of Great Britain Which By Their Express Terms or By Necessary Implication Apply to the Dominion of Canada.”[8] The footnote indicates that Mr. J.E. Read, a government lawyer in the Department of External Affairs, compiled this “tentative list” and updated it to 1943. This may be the same list to which Lapointe alluded in 1937. This list includes several British statues governing succession to the throne that apply as part of the laws of Canada, such as the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701, the Royal Marriages Act, 1774, as well as the various Crown Private Estates Acts and Demise of the Crown Acts. Crucially, His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936 also forms part of Canadian law because the Government of Canada requested and consented that the British Parliament extend it to Canada pursuant to section 4 of the Statute of Westminster. In 1938, Canadian constitutional scholar W.P.M. Kennedy defined the Constitution of Canada as a hybrid amalgam of codified and uncodified elements: The unwritten constitution includes all the great landmarks in British history in so far as they are working principles – Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, the Bill of Rights, the Habeus Corpus Act, the Act of Settlement – as well as the generally recognized conventions and usages. The written constitution is found in a series of Acts known and quoted as the British North America Acts, 1867-1915.[9] The laws and principles governing the succession to the Crown of Canada certainly fall under the category of “working principles”, and the Bill of Rights, 1689 and the Act of Settlement, 1701 both deal with succession; Kennedy is arguing that Canada has received these British statutes, and thus the royal succession itself, into its law. Kennedy thus corroborates Read’s list with respect to succession to the Crown. Canada has clearly always had laws on succession, contrary to the Government of Canada’s claims in 2013. British statutes form part of Canadian law and the Constitution of Canada 1981: Jean Chretien and Barry L. Strayer Explain that Section 52(2) Incorporates Non-Enumerated Statutes The primary sources show that in 1937, the Government of Canada believed that succession formed part of Canadian law, just as in 2013, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand understand that succession forms part of their countries’ respective bodies of law. The Government of Canada maintained that position in 1947-1948 and 1952-1953 after enacting alterations to the Royal Style and Titles. But for whatever reason, the Government of Canada never affirmed its long-held position in 1982 by adopting an Imperial Laws Application Act to replace the Colonial Laws Validity Act, as Australia and New Zealand had done in the 20th century. Barry L. Strayer, a former judge and Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice, recently wrote an autobiography on his involvement in patriating the constitution in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Perhaps Canada never passed equivalent legislation because section 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 “maintain[ed] the continuity of our system” by “reaffirming the constitutional supremacy principle” that before 1982 resided in section 7(1) of the Statute of Westminster and section 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act.[10] Strayer explained that section 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865 (a British statute) ensured that an Imperial law (passed at Westminster) would supersede a colonial law to the extent that they conflicted with one another. Until 1982, the British North America Acts served as Canada’s written constitution and existed as Imperial laws. Section 7(1) of the Statute of Westminster “saved” the British North America Acts and made them supreme over all federal and provincial Canadian statutes. Since Canada repealed section 4 and section 7(1) of the Statute of Westminster in 1982, and then made that amended act part of Canada’s constitution, the Constitution Act, 1982 needed to ensure the continuity of the principle of constitutional supremacy through section 52(2). In other words, section 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 should therefore guarantee that the British statutes that applied to Canada as part of the laws of Canada before 1982 continued to do so after 1982. The Patriation of the Constitution did not alter their status. As such, section 52(2) does not limit itself to an exhaustive definition of the Constitution of Canada; instead, it declares that the Constitution “includes” the statutes in the schedule – but it is not limited only to those statutes. In Canadian law and legislative drafting, “includes” means “including but not limited to”. This means that if we can demonstrate that if the Government of Canada regarded certain British statutes as part of Canadian law before 1982, it should continue to regard those statutes as part of the Constitution.\xa0 In fact, Assistant Attorney General Strayer and Attorney General Jean Chretien confirmed this interpretation before the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution in 1982! One of the Conservative MPs on the committee, Mr. John Munro, asked Chretien and Strayer about “certain omissions in Schedule I” of the Constitution Act, 1982.[11] Munro based his question on Maurice Ollivier’s other book, British North America Acts and Selected Statutes, 1867-1962, and the heading “Federal Statutes of Constitutional Significance.”[12] Under that category, Ollivier placed the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937, the Seals Act, the Governor General’s Act, and various other statutes – most of which the Schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982 now lists. But for whatever reason, the Department of Justice opted to exclude some of these statutes of constitutional character from the Schedule. Munro criticized these “selective omissions” and argued that the Schedule should include the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937, The Demise of the Crown Act, 1901, the Seals Act, the Governor General’s Act, and the Royal Style and Titles Act, 1953. Chretien referred to the Supremacy Clause, section 52(2): “The Constitution of Canada includes (a) the Canada Act, 1982, including this Act; (b) the Acts and orders referred to the schedule; and (c) any amendment to any Act or ordered referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).” Chretien also replied that the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937 would form part of the Constitution of Canada under section 52(2). When you use the word ‘includes,’ and the way that ‘c’ is drafted, it means that if ever there is another thing related to the Canadian constitution as part of it, should have been there, or might have been there, it is covered. So we do not have to renumerate [sic] the ones that you are mentioning.[13] Munro then asked whether the Department of Justice listed only some of Ollivier’s selected statutes because the Government intended to entrench only those acts enumerated in the schedule, and subject them to one of the amending formulas under Part V, and thus leave the omitted acts subject to the authority of the Parliament of Canada alone. Strayer explained that the Department of Justice did not take that view. […] that is certainly not the intention, nor is it, I think, the effect of the schedule the way it is. The purpose was to identify the main instruments of the Constitution of Canada, but, as the Minister [Chretien] pointed out, Clause 52(2) is not an exhaustive definition of the Constitution of Canada so that while we have certain things listed in the schedule which are clearly part of the constitution, that does not mean that there are not other things which are part of the constitution. […] [The schedule] is not an exhaustive list.[14] Chretien agreed with Strayer’s explanation, declaring: “You cannot get a better answer than that one.” Strayer then argued that the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General of 1947 form part of the Constitution of Canada under section 52(2) – even though this prerogative instrument does not appear in the schedule. Strayer reiterated his earlier argument: “The point of Clause 52(2) is that it does not purport to list exhaustively the whole Constitution.”[15] Barry Strayer – then an Assistant Deputy Minister in the Department of Justice and one of the main architects of the Constitution Act, 1982 – argued cogently and precisely that the Supremacy Clause “includes” various statutes that do not appear in the schedule, which “does not purport to list exhaustively the whole of the constitution.” Strayer also explained in his autobiography Canada’s Constitution Revolution that he designed section 52(2) to replace the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865 and section 7(1) of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, which “saved” the British North America Acts and left them within the jurisdiction of the British Parliament until Canada devised an indigenous amending formula. Logically, section 52(2), the Supremacy Clause, must now incorporate several British statutes into the Constitution of Canada because it replaced the Colonial Laws Validity Act, through which the British Parliament used to exercise its sovereignty over the Crown colonies to ensure that several British statutes automatically applied to Canada as part of the laws of Canada by necessary implication or their express terms. Attorney General Lapointe confirmed this interpretation as early as 1937. Robert Macgregor Dawson – the most underappreciated Canadian constitutional scholar of the 20th century – offers a potential explanation why the Department of Justice jettisoned its own sound legal interpretations of the mid-20th century: the Government’s lawyers simply forgot about succession, and the Department lost its expertise on the subject through attrition and retirement. Dawson explains, “the Canadian constitution also includes a number of British statutes expressly referring to Canada or to the empire.”[16] Dawson corroborates Prime Minister King and Attorney General Lapointe; he also argues that His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936 applies to Canada as part of the laws of Canada because the King Government requested and consented that the British Parliament apply it to Canada pursuant to section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, 1931. The surviving British statutes of major constitutional importance are few indeed. They are, as of 1970, the British North America Act and its amendments […] and the Statute of Westminster together with any acts which may have been passed at the express request of the Canadian government. The Declaration of Abdication Act, for example, is in the last group.[17] Dawson predicted that the Government of Canada would resolve the status of all the British statutes that apply to Canada as part of the law of Canada “when the British North America Act is ‘patriated’ to Canada.”[18] Unfortunately, the Department of Justice in 1982 focused on entrenching the Charter of Rights and Freedoms into the Constitution and neglected this equally important issue – even though the Government should have built upon the work of eminent lawyers like Ernest Lapointe and J.R. Read. Barry Strayer argues that the Supremacy Clause resolved this issue; in reality, however, the Department of Justice’s Great Neglect of 1981-1982 now means that the courts would have to adjudicate on whether section 52(2) “includes” x or y statute and incorporates it into the Constitution. The Government of Canada should have drawn up an “Imperial Laws Application Act” and included it in the schedule of the Constitution Act, 1982. Despite all the primary-source evidence that Lagassé and I have gathered on succession to the Crown and Royal Style and Titles and despite the secondary sources on the Crown as corporation that we have put forward, I can now only come to the depressing conclusion that nothing that we uncover and argue will sway the Government of Canada and the scholars who support the lawyers in the Department of Justice. Even the Government of Canada of 1937 and 1943 cannot convince the Government of Canada of 2013 to see reason. The Harper Government has morphed this pure legal-constitutional issue into a political question – and in politics, the Orwellian tactics of assertion and mendacious rhetoric count for more than do facts and clearly historical precedents. I have provided several pieces of evidence that disprove the Department of Justice’s assertion – yet these facts have not dissuaded the Government’s greatest supporters. In fact, Canada does possess its own laws on succession: Canada has not only received British statute pertaining to the succession like the Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement, but in 1936, the King Government invoked section 4 of the Statute of Westminster and requested and consented that the Westminster Parliament legislate for Canada. Consequently, His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936 applies as part of Canadian law – since that is what “to legislate on behalf of” means. Furthermore, the Parliament of Canada even assented retroactively to this British statute in March 1937 through the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937, which also incorporated the His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936 into Canadian law a second time by listing it as a statutory schedule. The Commons Debates from 1937 clearly show that Prime Minister Mackenzie King and Justice Minister Ernest Lapointe made the necessary decisions to ensure that the Abdication Acts applied to Canada as part of Canadian law, because they sought to affirm the “equality of status” that the Statute of Westminster had codified in 1931. (In “The Government of Canada’s Position on Succession in 1937,” I laid out all these arguments in more detail). In 1937, Lapointe explained to the Commons that various British statutes form part of the laws of Canada, and that the Parliament of Canada could now amend, repeal, or re-enact of such British statute by virtue of section 2 of the Statute of Westminster, which repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865. Lapointe also alluded to the Government of Canada’s compilation of the various British statutes that form part of Canadian law. In 1943, J.E. Read, a government lawyer working in the Department of External Affairs, forwarded his list of British statutes that apply as part of Canadian law by necessary implication or by express enactment to Maurice Ollivier, a law clerk at the House of Commons. Finally, in 1981, Chretien and Strayer explained that the Supremacy Clause would cover the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937 and the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of 1947. All the historical evidence shows that the Government of Canada believed – at least between 1937 and 1981 – that succession forms part of Canadian law because Canada has received the Bill of Rights, 1689 and the Act of Settlement, 1701 and because the British parliament passed His Majesty’s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936 for the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. I doubt that anyone will pay this evidence any attention; the proponents of the Government of Canada’s position of 2013 may remark that I have “nicely lain out” my argument or acknowledge that these primary sources are “interesting” – but they would probably also dismiss them as “irrelevant” (without properly explaining why, of course!). I, however, will continue to adhere to the Government of Canada’s position on succession of 1936-1981. Alternatively, they will praise the Government’s approach as “practical” – a choice of words that betrays their fear of facing the consequences if Lagassé and I are right that succession to the Crown falls under section 41(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982 because it pertains to “the office of the Queen,” since the Crown is a corporation sole. Thankfully, Canada will have several decades to bring its laws on succession in line with those of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The succession to the British Crown now operates on equal primogeniture, while the succession to Canada’s Crown has thus far retained the male-preference cognatic primogeniture that gives preference to younger sons over older daughters. However, the distinct British and Canadian laws on succession will not come into conflict for at least three generations: as Prime Minister Harper remarked when a reporter first asked him about this subject during the federal election of 2011, the heir to the throne – the Prince of Wales – is a man, and the next heir to the throne – the Duke of Cambridge – is a man. In July 2013, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were safely delivered of a son, which means that the third heir to the throne – Prince George – will also be a man. Given that Canada can “open” the constitution at the opportune moment in order to alter the law on succession at any point over the next few decades, the court in Quebec currently reviewing this case should not impose any undue constraints on itself, consider all the available historical evidence, and treat this issue with the dignity and diligence that it deserves and so desperately needs.

Bowden and Parliamentum with appropriate and specific direction to the original content."", '', 'The Parliament of Canada (French: Parlement du Canada) is the federal legislature of Canada, seated at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and is composed of three parts: the King, the Senate, and the House of Commons.[1] By constitutional convention, the House of Commons is dominant, with the Senate rarely opposing its will. The Senate reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint and may initiate certain bills. The monarch or his representative, normally the governor general, provides royal assent to make bills into law. The governor general, on behalf of the monarch, summons and appoints the 105 senators on the advice of the prime minister, while each of the 338 members of the House of Commons – called members of Parliament (MPs) – represents an electoral district, commonly referred to as a riding, and are elected by Canadian voters residing in the riding. The governor general also summons and calls together the House of Commons, and may prorogue or dissolve Parliament, in order to either end a parliamentary session or call a general election. The governor general also delivers the Throne Speech at the opening of each new Parliament (the monarch occasionally has done so, instead of the governor general, when visiting Canada). The current Parliament, summoned by Governor General Mary Simon in November 2021, is the 44th Parliament since Confederation in 1867. The official languages of the Parliament are English and French.[2] The body consists of the Canadian monarch, represented by a viceroy, the governor general; an upper house, the Senate; and a lower house, the House of Commons. Each element has its own officers and organization. Each has a distinct role, but work in conjunction within the legislative process. This format was inherited from the United Kingdom and is a near-identical copy of the Parliament at Westminster, the greatest differences stemming from situations unique to Canada, such as the impermanent nature of the monarch\'s residency in the country and the lack of a peerage to form the upper chamber. Only those who sit in the House of Commons are usually called members of Parliament (MPs); the term is not usually applied to senators (except in legislation, such as the Parliament of Canada Act), even though the Senate is a part of Parliament. Though legislatively less powerful, senators take higher positions in the national order of precedence. No individual may serve in more than one chamber at the same time. The sovereign\'s place in the legislature, formally known as the King-in-Parliament,[3] is defined by the Constitution Act, 1867, and various conventions.[1] Neither he nor his viceroy, however, participates in the legislative process save for signifying the King\'s approval to a bill passed by both houses of Parliament, known as the granting of Royal Assent, which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law. All federal bills thus begin with the phrase ""Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows\xa0...""[4] and, as such, the Crown is immune from acts of Parliament unless expressed otherwise in the act itself.[5] The governor general will normally perform the task of granting Royal Assent, though the monarch may also do so, at the request of either the Cabinet or the viceroy, who may defer assent to the sovereign as per the constitution.[6] As both the monarch and his or her representatives are traditionally barred from the House of Commons, any parliamentary ceremonies in which they are involved take place in the Senate chamber. The upper and lower houses do, however, each contain a mace, which indicates the authority of the King-in-Parliament and the privilege granted to that body by him,[7][8] both bearing a crown at their apex. The original mace for the Senate was that used in the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada after 1849, while that of the House of Commons was inherited from the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, first used in 1845. Following the burning of the Centre Block on 3 February 1916, the City of London, England, donated a replacement, which is still used today. The temporary mace, made of wood, and used until the new one arrived from the United Kingdom in 1917, is still carried into the Senate each 3 February.[9] The Senate\'s 1.6-metre-long mace comprises brass and gold. The Senate may not sit if its mace is not in the chamber; it typically sits on the table with the crown facing the throne,[10]:\u200a55\u200a though it may, during certain ceremonies, be held by the mace bearer, standing adjacent to the governor general or monarch in the Senate.[10]:\u200a51 Members of the two houses of Parliament must also express their loyalty to the sovereign and defer to his authority, as the Oath of Allegiance must be sworn by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seats. Further, the official opposition is formally called His Majesty\'s Loyal Opposition, to signify that, though they may be opposed to the incumbent Cabinet\'s policies, they remain dedicated to the apolitical Crown.[11][12] The upper house of the Parliament of Canada, the Senate (French: Sénat), is a group of 105 individuals appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister;[13] all those appointed must, per the constitution, be a minimum of 30 years old, be a subject of the monarch, and own property with a net worth of at least $4,000, in addition to owning land worth no less than $4,000 within the province the candidate seeks to represent.[14] Senators served for life until 1965, when a constitutional amendment imposed a mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators may, however, resign their seats prior to that mark, and can lose their position should they fail to attend two consecutive sessions of Parliament. The principle underlying the Senate\'s composition is equality amongst Canada\'s geographic regions (called Divisions in the Constitution): 24 for Ontario, 24 for Quebec, 24 for the Maritimes (10 for Nova Scotia, 10 for New Brunswick, and four for Prince Edward Island), and 24 for the Western provinces (six each for Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta).[15] Additionally, senators are appointed from two geographic areas not part of any senatorial division. Newfoundland and Labrador (since 1949 the ""newest"" province, although ""oldest"" English settlement), is represented by six senators. Since 1975 each of Canada\'s territories is represented by 1 senator—the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and (since its formation in 1999) Nunavut. An additional 4 or 8 senators may be appointed by the governor general, provided the approval of the King is secured and the four divisions are equally represented. This power has been employed once since 1867: to ensure the passage of the bill establishing the Goods and Services Tax, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney advised Queen Elizabeth II to appoint extra senators in 1990. This results in a temporary maximum number of senators of 113, which must through attrition return to its normal number of 105. The elected component of the Canadian Parliament is the House of Commons (French: Chambre des communes), with each member chosen by a plurality of voters in each of the country\'s federal electoral districts, or ridings. To run for one of the 338 seats in the lower house, an individual must be at least 18 years old. Each member holds office until Parliament is dissolved, after which they may seek re-election. The ridings are regularly reorganized according to the results of each decennial national census;[16] however, the ""senatorial clause"" of the Constitution Act, 1867 guarantees each province at least as many MPs as it has senators,[17] and the ""grandfather clause"" permits each province as many MPs as it had in either 1976 or 1985.[16] The existence of this legislation has pushed the size of the House of Commons above the required minimum of 282 seats. The powers of the Parliament of Canada are limited by the constitution, which divides legislative abilities between the federal and provincial legislatures; in general, provincial legislatures may only pass laws relating to topics explicitly reserved for them by the constitution (such as education, provincial officers, municipal government, charitable institutions, and ""matters of a merely local or private nature"")[18] while any matter not under the exclusive authority of the provincial legislatures is within the scope of the federal Parliament\'s power. Thus, Parliament alone can pass laws relating to, among other things, the postal service, census, military, navigation and shipping, fishing, currency, banking, weights and measures, bankruptcy, copyrights, patents, First Nations, and naturalization.[19] In some cases, however, the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial parliaments may be more vague. For instance, the federal parliament regulates marriage and divorce in general, but the solemnization of marriage is regulated only by the provincial legislatures. Other examples include the powers of both the federal and provincial parliaments to impose taxes, borrow money, punish crimes, and regulate agriculture. The powers of Parliament are also limited by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, though most of its provisions can be overridden by use of the notwithstanding clause.[20] Such clause, however, has never been used by the federal parliament, though it has been employed by some provincial legislatures. Laws violating any part of the constitution are invalid and may be ruled unconstitutional by the courts. Each of Parliament\'s two chambers is presided over by a speaker; that for the Senate is a member appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister, while the equivalent for the House of Commons is a member of Parliament, who is elected by the other members of that body. In general, the powers of the latter are greater than those of the former. Following the British model, the upper chamber is essentially self-regulating, but the lower chamber is controlled by the chair, in a majoritarian model that gives great power and authority to the chair. In 1991, however, the powers of the speaker of the Senate were expanded, which reorganized the balance of power to be closer to the framework of the Commons.[citation needed] The usher of the black rod  of the Senate of Canada is the most senior protocol position in Parliament, being the personal messenger to the legislature of the sovereign and governor general. The usher is also a floor officer of the Senate responsible for security in that chamber, as well as for protocol, administrative, and logistical details of important events taking place on Parliament Hill,[21] such as the Speech from the Throne, Royal Assent ceremonies, state funerals, or the investiture of a new governor general.[22] Other officers of Parliament include the auditor general, chief electoral officer, official languages commissioner, privacy commissioner, information commissioner, conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, public sector integrity commissioner, and commissioner of lobbying. These individuals are appointed by either one or both houses, to which they report through the speaker of that house. They are sometimes referred to as Agents of Parliament.[23] Another key official is the parliamentary librarian, a position established in 1871 under the Library of Parliament Act, charged with directing the Library of Parliament. The Constitution Act, 1867, outlines that the governor general alone is responsible for summoning Parliament, though it remains the monarch\'s prerogative to prorogue and dissolve the legislature, after which the writs for a general federal election are usually dropped by the governor general at Rideau Hall. Upon completion of the election, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister, then issues a royal proclamation summoning Parliament to assemble. On the date given, new MPs are sworn in and then are, along with returning MPs, called to the Senate, where they are instructed to elect their speaker and return to the House of Commons to do so before adjourning.[10]:\u200a42 The new parliamentary session is marked by the opening of Parliament, a ceremony where a range of topics can be addressed in a Speech From the Throne given by the monarch, the governor general, or a royal delegate.[note 1] The usher of the black rod invites MPs to these events,[24] knocking on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed shut[25]—a symbolic arrangement designed to illustrate the Commons\' right to deny entry to anyone, including even the monarch (but with an exception for royal messengers).[26] Once the MPs are gathered behind the Bar of the Senate—save for the prime minister, the only MP permitted into the Senate proper to sit near the throne dais—the House of Commons speaker presents to the monarch or governor general, and formally claims the rights and privileges of the House of Commons; and then the speaker of the Senate, on behalf of the Crown, replies in acknowledgement after the sovereign or viceroy takes their seat on the throne.[10]:\u200a42\u200a The speech is then read aloud. It can outline the program of the Cabinet for the upcoming legislative session, as well as other matters chosen by the speaker. A parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another proclamation calling for a new session to begin; except for the election of a speaker for the House of Commons and his or her claiming of that house\'s privileges, the same procedures for the opening of Parliament are again followed. After a number of such sessions—having ranged from one to seven[10]:\u200a45\u200a—a Parliament comes to an end via dissolution, and a general election typically follows. Subject to the governor general\'s discretion, general elections are held four years after the previous on the third Monday in October or, on the recommendation of the chief electoral officer, the following Tuesday or Monday. The governor general may dissolve Parliament and call a general election outside of these fixed dates, conventionally on the advice of the prime minister, which may be preceded by a successful motion of no confidence. The timing of such dissolutions may be politically motivated.[27][28][29] Both houses determine motions by voice vote; the presiding officer puts the question and, after listening to shouts of ""yea"" and ""nay"" from the members, announces which side is victorious. This decision by the Speaker is final, unless a recorded vote is demanded by members—requiring at least two in the Senate and five in the House of Commons. Members of both houses vote by rising in their places to be counted; the speaker of the Senate is permitted to vote on a motion or bill—though does so irregularly, in the interest of impartiality—and, if there is no majority, the motion is defeated. In the Commons, however, the speaker cannot vote, unless to break a tie. The speaker customarily votes in favour of the status quo. The constitution establishes the quorums to be 15 senators in the upper house and 20 members in the lower house, the speaker of each body being counted within the tally. Voting can thus take three possible forms: whenever possible, leaving the matter open for future consideration and allowing for further discussion by the house; when no further discussion is possible, taking into account that the matter could somehow be brought back in future and be decided by a majority in the house; or, leaving a bill in its existing form rather than having it amended. For example, during the vote on the 2005 budget, which was considered a vote of confidence, the speaker of the House of Commons cast the tie-breaking vote during the second reading, moving in favour of the budget and allowing its passage. If the vote on the third reading had again been tied, the speaker would have been expected to vote against the bill, bringing down the government. Simultaneous interpretation for both official languages, English and French, is provided at all times during sessions of both houses. Laws, known in their draft form as bills, may be introduced by any member of either house. However, most bills originate in the House of Commons, of which most are put forward by ministers of the Crown, making them government bills, as opposed to private members\' bills or private senators\' bills, which are launched by MPs and senators, respectively, who are not in cabinet. Draft legislation may also be categorized as public bills, if they apply to the general public, or private bills, if they concern a particular person or limited group of people. Each bill then goes through a series of stages in each chamber, beginning with the first reading. It is not, however, until the bill\'s second reading that the general principles of the proposed law are debated; though rejection is a possibility, such is not common for government bills. Next, the bill is sent by the house where it is being debated to one of several committees. The Standing Orders outline the general mandate for all committees, allowing them to review: bills as they pertain to relevant departments; the program and policy plans, as well as the projected expenditures, and the effectiveness of the implementation thereof, for the same departments; and the analysis of the performance of those departments.[30] Most often, bills end up before a standing committee, which is a body of members or senators who specialize in a particular subject (such as foreign affairs), and who may hear testimony from ministers and experts, debate the bill, and recommend amendments. The bill may also be committed to the Committee of the Whole, a body consisting of, as the name suggests, all the members of the chamber in question. Finally, the bill could be referred to an ad hoc committee established solely to review the piece of legislation in question. Each chamber has their own procedure for dealing with this, with the Senate establishing special committees that function like most other committees, and the House of Commons establishing legislative committees, the chair of the latter being appointed by the speaker of the House of Commons, and is normally one of his deputies. Whichever committee is used, any amendments proposed by the committee are considered by the whole house in the report stage. Furthermore, additional amendments not proposed by the committee may also be made. After the report stage (or, if the committee made no amendments to the bill, immediately after the committee stage), the final phase of the bill—the third reading—occurs, at which time further amendments are not permitted in the House of Commons, but are allowed in the Senate. If it passes the third reading, the bill is sent to the other house of Parliament, where it passes through the same stages;[note 2] amendments made by the second chamber require the assent of the original house in order to stand part of the final bill. If one house passes amendments that the other will not agree to, and the two houses cannot resolve their disagreements, the bill fails. Once the bill is passed in identical form by both houses, it is presented for Royal Assent; in theory, the governor general has three options:  grant Royal Assent, thereby making the bill into law; withhold Royal Assent, thereby vetoing the bill; or reserve the bill for the signification of the King\'s pleasure, which allows the sovereign to personally grant or withhold assent. If the governor general does grant Royal Assent, the monarch may, within two years, disallow the bill, thus annulling the law in question. In the federal sphere, no bill has ever been denied royal approval. In conformity with the British model, only the House of Commons may originate bills for the imposition of taxes or for the appropriation of Crown funds. The constitutional amendment procedure does make provision for the Commons overcoming an otherwise-required Senate resolution in most cases. Otherwise, the theoretical power of both houses over bills is equal, with the assent of each being required for passage. In practice, however, the House of Commons is dominant, with the Senate rarely exercising its powers in a way that opposes the will of the democratically elected house. The federal government consists of the monarch (represented by the governor general)-in-council, which is a collection of ministers of the Crown appointed by the governor general to direct the use of executive powers. Per the tenets of responsible government, these individuals are almost always drawn from Parliament, and are predominantly from the House of Commons, the only body to which ministers are held accountable, typically during Question Period, wherein ministers are obliged to answer questions posed by members of the opposition. Hence, the person who can command the confidence of the lower chamber—usually the leader of the party with the most seats therein—is typically appointed as prime minister. Should that person not hold a seat in the House of Commons, the prime minister will, by convention, seek election to one at the earliest possible opportunity; frequently, in such situations, a junior member of Parliament who holds a safe seat will resign to allow the prime minister to run for that riding in a by-election. If no party holds a majority, it is customary for the governor general to summon a minority government or coalition government, depending on which the commons will support. The lower house may attempt to bring down the government by either rejecting a motion of confidence—generally initiated by a minister to reinforce the Cabinet\'s support in the commons—or by passing a motion of no confidence—introduced by the opposition to display its distrust of the Cabinet. Important bills that form part of the government\'s agenda will usually be considered matters of confidence; the budget is always a matter of confidence. Where a government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons, the prime minister is obliged to either resign (allowing the governor general to appoint the leader of the Opposition to the office) or seek the dissolution of Parliament and the call of a general election. A precedent, however, was set in 1968, when the government of Lester B. Pearson unexpectedly lost a confidence vote but was allowed to remain in power with the mutual consent of the leaders of the other parties. In practice, the House of Commons\' scrutiny of the government is quite weak in comparison to the equivalent chamber in other countries using the Westminster system. With the plurality voting system used in parliamentary elections tending to provide the governing party with a large majority, and a party system that gives leaders strict control over their caucus (to the point that MPs may be expelled from their parties for voting against the instructions of party leaders), there is often limited need to compromise with other parties. Additionally, Canada has fewer MPs, a higher turnover rate of MPs after each election, and an Americanized system for selecting political party leaders, leaving them accountable to the party membership rather than caucus, as is the case in the United Kingdom;[31] John Robson of the National Post opined that Canada\'s parliament had become a body akin to the American Electoral College, ""its sole and ceremonial role to confirm the executive in power.""[32] At the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, analysts—such as Jeffrey Simpson, Donald Savoie, and John Gomery—argued that both Parliament and the Cabinet had become eclipsed by prime ministerial power.[33] Thus, defeats of majority governments on issues of confidence are very rare. In contrast, a minority government is more volatile, and is more likely to fall due to loss of confidence. The last prime ministers to lose confidence votes were Stephen Harper in 2011, Paul Martin in 2005 and Joe Clark in 1979, all involving minority governments. The passage of the Reform Act and resulting changes to the Parliament of Canada Act, in 2015, were a response to this trend and an attempt to increase the power and independence of MPs.[34][35][36][37] Parliament possesses a number of privileges, collectively and accordingly known as parliamentary privilege, each house being the guardian and administrator of its own set of rights. Parliament itself determines the extent of parliamentary privilege, each house overseeing its own affairs, but the constitution bars it from conferring any ""exceeding those at the passing of such an Act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the [British House of] Commons... and by the Members thereof.""[38] The foremost dispensation held by both houses of Parliament is that of freedom of speech in debate; nothing said within the chambers may be questioned by any court or other institution outside of Parliament. In particular, a member of either house cannot be sued for slander based on words uttered in the course of parliamentary proceedings, the only restraint on debate being set by the standing orders of each house. Further, MPs and senators are immune to arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, from jury service and attendance in courts as witnesses. They may, however, be disciplined by their colleagues for breach of the rules, including contempt of Parliament—disobedience of its authority; for example, giving false testimony before a parliamentary committee—and breaches of its own privileges. The Canadian Heraldic Authority, on 15 April 2008, granted the Parliament of Canada, as an institution, a heraldic achievement composed of symbols of the three elements of Parliament: the escutcheon of the Royal Arms of Canada with the maces of the House of Commons and Senate crossed behind.[39] The budget for the Parliament of Canada for the 2010 fiscal year was $583,567,000.[40] Following the cession of New France to the United Kingdom in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Canada was governed according to the Royal Proclamation issued by King George III in that same year. To this was added the Quebec Act, by which the power to make ordinances was granted to a governor-in-council, both the governor and council being appointed by the British monarch in Westminster, on the advice of his or her ministers there. In 1791, the Province of Quebec was divided into Upper and Lower Canada, each with an elected legislative assembly, an appointed legislative council, and a governor, mirroring the parliamentary structure in Britain. During the War of 1812, American troops set fire to the buildings of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in York (now Toronto). In 1841, the British government united the two Canadas into the Province of Canada, with a single legislature composed of, again, an assembly, council, and governor general; the 84 members of the lower chamber were equally divided among the two former provinces, though Lower Canada had a higher population. The governor still held significant personal influence over Canadian affairs until 1848, when responsible government was implemented in Canada. The actual site of Parliament shifted on a regular basis: From 1841 to 1844, it sat in Kingston, where the present Kingston General Hospital now stands; from 1844 until the 1849 fire that destroyed the building, the legislature was in Montreal; and, after a few years of alternating between Toronto and Quebec City, the legislature was finally moved to Ottawa in 1856, Queen Victoria having chosen that city as Canada\'s capital[citation needed] in 1857. The modern-day Parliament of Canada came into existence in 1867, in which year the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland passed the British North America Act, 1867, uniting the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Canada—with the Province of Canada split into Quebec and Ontario—into a single federation called the Dominion of Canada. Though the form of the new federal legislature was again nearly identical to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the decision to retain this model was made with heavy influence from the just-concluded American Civil War, which indicated to many Canadians the faults of the American federal system, with its relatively powerful states and a less powerful federal government. The British North America Act limited the powers of the provinces, providing that all subjects not explicitly delegated to them by that document remain within the authority of the Canadian Parliament, while simultaneously giving the provinces unique powers in certain agreed-upon areas of jurisdiction. Full legislative autonomy was granted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Though the statute allowed the Parliament of Canada to repeal or amend previously British laws as they applied to Canada, it did not permit amendment to Canada\'s constitution, including the British North America Acts. Hence, whenever a constitutional amendment was sought by the Canadian Parliament, the enactment of a British law was necessary, though Canada\'s consent was required. The Parliament of Canada was granted limited power to amend the constitution by a British Act of Parliament in 1949, but it was not permitted to affect the powers of provincial governments, the official positions of the English and French languages, rights of any class of persons with respect to schools, or the maximum five-year term of the legislature. While her father, King George VI, had been the first Canadian monarch to grant royal assent in the legislature—doing so in 1939—Queen Elizabeth II was the first sovereign to deliver the speech from the throne. This event, in 1957, was the first time television cameras were allowed into the chambers of parliament, as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast the speech nation-wide.[41] The Canadian House of Commons and Senate last requested the Parliament of the United Kingdom to enact a constitutional amendment in 1982, in the form of the Canada Act 1982 which included the Constitution Act, 1982.[42] This legislation terminated the power of the British Parliament\'s ability to legislate for Canada and the authority to amend the constitution was transferred to the Canadian House of Commons, the Senate, and the provincial legislative assemblies, acting jointly. Most amendments require the consent of the Senate, the House of Commons, and the legislative assemblies of two-thirds of the provinces representing a majority of the population; the unanimous consent of provincial legislative assemblies is required for certain amendments, including those affecting the sovereign, the governor general, the provincial lieutenant governors, the official status of the English and French languages, the Supreme Court of Canada, and the amending formulas themselves.

English colonisation of North America began in the 16th century in Newfoundland, then further south at Roanoke and Jamestown, Virginia, and more substantially with the founding of the Thirteen Colonies along the Atlantic Coast of North America. The British Empire\'s colonial territories in North America were greatly expanded in connection with the Treaty of Paris (1763), which formally concluded the Seven Years\' War, referred to by the English colonies in North America as the French and Indian War, and by the French colonies as la Guerre de la Conquête. With the ultimate acquisition of most of New France (Nouvelle-France), British territory in North America was more than doubled in size, and the exclusion of France also dramatically altered the political landscape of the continent. The term British America was used to refer to the British Empire\'s colonial territories in North America prior to the United States Declaration of Independence, most famously in the 1774 address of Thomas Jefferson to the First Continental Congress entitled: A Summary View of the Rights of British America. The term British North America was initially used following the subsequent Treaty of Paris (1783), which concluded the American Revolutionary War and confirmed the independence of Great Britain\'s Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States of America. The terms British America and British North America continued to be used for Britain\'s remaining territories in North America, but the term British North America came to be used more consistently in connection with the provinces that would eventually form the Dominion of Canada, following the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. The Dominion of Canada was formed under the British North America (BNA) Act, 1867, also referred to as the Constitution Act, 1867. Following royal assent of the BNA Act, three of the provinces of British North America (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which would become the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec)) joined to form ""One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom,"" on July 1, 1867, the date of Canadian Confederation. The Atlantic island of Bermuda (originally administered by the Virginia Company and, with The Bahamas, considered with North America prior to 1783), was grouped with the Maritime provinces from 1783 until formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, and thereafter generally with the colonies in the British West Indies (although the Church of England continued to place Bermuda under the Bishop of Newfoundland until 1919). Over its duration, British North America comprised the British Empire\'s colonial territories in North America from 1783 to 1907, not including the Caribbean. These territories include those forming modern-day Canada, as well as all or large parts of six Midwestern U.S. states (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the northeastern part of Minnesota), which were formed out of the Northwest Territory, and large parts of Maine, which had originally been within the French territory of Acadia. In 1775, on the eve of the American Revolution, the British Empire included 20 territories in the Western Hemisphere northeast of New Spain. These colonies were: Britain had acquired Quebec from France and East and West Florida from Spain by the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years\' War. The United States of America, upon acknowledgement of their sovereignty, acquired the part of Quebec south of the Great Lakes by the Treaty of Paris (1783); at the same time Spain gained West Florida and regained East Florida. Nova Scotia was split into modern-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 1784. The part of Quebec retained after 1783 was split into the primarily French-speaking Lower Canada and the primarily English-speaking Upper Canada in 1791. After the War of 1812, the Treaty of 1818 established the 49th parallel as the United States–British North America border from Rupert\'s Land west to the Rocky Mountains. Britain gave up Oregon south of the 49th parallel, which was part of the Hudson\'s Bay Company\'s Columbia District, under the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The boundary of British North America with Maine was clarified by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842. The Canadas were united into the Province of Canada in 1841. On 1 July 1867, in an action known as Confederation, an act of the British Parliament called the British North America Act formed the Dominion of Canada from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The former Province of Canada was split back into its pre-1841 parts, with Canada East (Lower Canada) renamed Quebec, and Canada West (Upper Canada) renamed Ontario. These were the original four provinces of Canada. In 1870, Rupert\'s Land was annexed to Canada as the Northwest Territories (NWT) and the new province of Manitoba. British Columbia, the British colony on the west coast north of the 49th parallel, joined as Canada\'s sixth province in 1871, and Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. The boundary of British Columbia with Washington Territory was settled by arbitration in 1872, and with Alaska by arbitration in 1903. The Arctic Archipelago was ceded by Britain to Canada in 1880 and added to the Northwest Territories. Subsequently, large sections of the NWT were split off as new territories (Yukon, 1898; Nunavut, 1999) or provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan, both in 1905), or were added to existing provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, in stages ending in 1912). In 1907 the sole remaining British North American colony, Newfoundland, was granted dominion status, although starting in 1934 it returned to British administration under the Commission of Government. In 1949 the island of Newfoundland, and its associated mainland territory of Labrador, joined Canada as the tenth province. Although semi-independent from 1867, and fully sovereign on foreign affairs with the Statute of Westminster 1931, the last vestiges of Canada\'s constitutional dependency upon Britain remained until Canadians agreed on an internal procedure for amending the Canadian Constitution. This agreement was implemented when the British Parliament passed the Constitution Act of 1982 at the request of Parliament of Canada.', 'William F.

The Act also formally ended the ""request and consent"" provisions of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in relation to Canada, whereby the British parliament had a general power to pass laws extending to Canada at its own request."

[31]  In 2018, Edward Guo was honored with The Helen Rice Award by the Associated Chamber Music Players (ACMP) Foundation in recognition of those who have moved the chamber music world in a new directions. [32] On October 19, 2007, the IMSLP closed following legal demands from Universal Edition of Vienna, Austria. [33]  The cease and desist letter expressed concern that some works that are in public domain in the server\'s location in Canada with copyright protection of 50 years following death, but are protected by the 70 years following death term in some other countries, were available in those countries. The administrator of the website, Edward W. Guo, also known under the nickname Feldmahler, decided to close down the repository, but left the forums online so that discussions into the best way to proceed could be made: [34] On Saturday October 13, 2007, I received a second Cease and Desist letter from Universal Edition. At first I thought this letter would be similar in content to the first Cease and Desist letter I received in August. However, after lengthy discussions with very knowledgeable lawyers and supporters, I became painfully aware of the fact that I, a normal college student, has neither the energy nor the money necessary to deal with this issue in any other way than to agree with the cease and desist, and take down the entire site. I cannot apologize enough to all IMSLP contributors, who have done so much for IMSLP in the last two years. In response, director Michael S. Hart of Project Gutenberg offered support to keep the project online. [35]  This offer was declined by Guo, who voiced concern about having the project hosted in the United States, and consulted the Canadian wing of Project Gutenberg. [34]  On November 2, 2007, Michael Geist, a prominent Canadian copyright academic, wrote an article for the BBC discussing the specifics and the wider implications of this case. [36] This case is enormously importantfrom a public domain perspective. IMSLP went back online on June 30, 2008. Since its reopening, the site has been using a strict copyright policy wherein uploaded files are made accessible for download only after the copyright status for three most frequent copyright regimes has been reviewed by staff members. Although the server is located in Canada, files that are not public domain in the US were until July 2010 flagged [TB], for \'Technical Block\' or \'Temporary Block\', and could not be viewed. The FAQ posted in their forum stated, ""Unfortunately, these \'temporary\' blocks will be until further notice – possibly all the way until the expiration of term in the USA."" [37]  After an initial phase, [TB] flagged items have essentially disappeared thanks to the introduction of regional servers operated by unaffiliated organizations (see next). On 21 April 2011, the Music Publishers Association (UK) issued a DMCA takedown notice against the IMSLP. Go Daddy, the domain name registrar for the IMSLP, removed the domain name ""imslp.org"", leaving it inaccessible. [38]  The MPA\'s argument was similar to that made in 2007 by Universal Edition. In particular, the MPA claimed that Rachmaninoff\'s 1913 choral symphony  The Bells  violated US and EU copyright. [39]  According to the IMSLP, the action is without any merit. [40]  Almost 24 hours later, the MPA (UK) announced on Twitter that they had asked Go Daddy to reinstate the domain name. [41] On November 7, 2017, the IMSLP received a cease and desist letter from the heirs of Sergei Prokofiev expressing concern that the composer\'s music was available for download in countries where his music was still under copyright protection.[ citation needed ] This demand was followed up by a separate letter from the National Music Publishers Association on January 19, 2018. On February 23, 2018, access to all compositions by Prokofiev was blocked by the IMSLP in response to these legal threats. The issues were partially resolved on the IMSLP forums in July 2018, resulting in the reupload of Prokofiev\'s pre-1923 works. In August, the remainder of Prokofiev\'s works were reuploaded so that they would only be available in the countries they are allowed in.[ citation needed ] On December 27, 2015, the IMSLP moved to a subscription-based model, where users are expected to pay to avoid a waiting period on some of the files available on the site, and to access certain newly uploaded files. [42]  Users who have not paid are subject to a 15-second waiting period on certain files (excluding Creative Commons-licensed files that constitute a majority of the site\'s files), [43]  are required to wait up to two days to access newly uploaded files, and are shown advertising. [44] Guo attributed the change in funding to discussions with librarians at an IAML conference in June 2015. Some contributors to the website expressed concerns that Guo had not properly attempted to raise donations, but without any prior warning, introduced the membership system to monetize their work. [47] On April 18, 2016, the IMSLP announced [48]  on its Twitter account that all subscribers will have access to the Naxos Music Library. On July 10, 2010, a forum thread [49]  announced the opening of a new server located in the Netherlands. This server allows works that are public domain in Canada and the EU to be downloaded legally, even if they are under copyright in the US. The server was initially run by an unaffiliated European organization, while a forum thread  [50]  later announced that operations had been handed over to Project Leonardo, a new unaffiliated company incorporated in New Zealand to ""provide web hosting services to online libraries that distribute free contents in any fields of arts and science"". Files on the EU server are flagged (EU). A similar, also unaffiliated, US server allows users to download works that are in the public domain only in the US.  Unlike the other servers, this one can only be contributed to by administrators and users who have asked for the privilege, though the files are freely accessible for download. On July 1, 2013, a forum thread [51]  announced the opening of a new server located in Canada and operated by Project Leonardo, the unaffiliated company that also runs the EU server. This server is especially intended for users located in countries where copyright lasts 50 years from the death of the author, such as Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and many others. Files on the CA server are flagged (CA). On August 23, 2011, an announcement [52]  was made that the Werner Icking Music Archive would merge with the IMSLP.  WIMA had announced the merge on its own site five days before in an open letter to contributors. [53]   After working out some technical issues, the IMSLP decided to officially commence the merge on August 28. The merge was announced to be complete on July 21, 2012. [54] IMSLP is now owned by Project Petrucci LLC, a private company created to run the website. Project Petrucci LLC was registered as a Delaware limited-liability company on June 28, 2008, [55]  when the site founder was studying at the New England Conservatory. [56]  [57]  The website provides an e-mail address for the site\'s founder (""preferred""), and a physical address for the company\'s registered agent in the United States (for ""any legal or formal correspondence"").

The Uruguay Round Agreements Act is an Act of Congress in the United States that implemented in U.S. law the Marrakesh Agreement of 1994. The Marrakesh Agreement was part of the Uruguay Round of negotiations which transformed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) into the World Trade Organization (WTO). One of its effects is to give United States copyright protection to foreign works that had previously been in the public domain in the United States. The Werner Icking Music Archive is a web archive of liberally licensed sheet music of public domain music. The scores are electronically typeset by volunteers and distributed in PDF, often accompanied by their typesetting files. WIMA continues the defunct GMD Music Archive and is named after its founder, the late Werner Icking. After a merge completed in 2012, the archive forms part of the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP).

who is and what is the role of the lord mayor of the city of london,"['', 'Passport-collector.com The Passport Of Captain Francis Garratt was issued in 1875 in London, which makes the travel document 144 years old. But what is most astonishing is the fact that the document looks like made just yesterday. Amazing! There is not a single flaw at this passport which comes in a custom made brown leather case (the leather is still shiny and indeed perfect). The thin paper of the passport is strengthened by a linen layer, which makes the document much more durable. Also, this is custom made. The linen material has a light blue color, which gives the document also a greater “importance,” compared to ordinary passports. When I ever saw an old passport in perfect condition, then it’s this one. In the upper left corner is a visa of the German Empire issued at the German Consulate General in London, 5 July 1875, precisely on the same date when the passport was issued at the Foreign Office in London. Such services (cases and visas) were done by passport agents like Lee & Carter, West Strand, London – where this customized travel document was ordered as well. The Lord Mayor of London\xa0is the City of London’s mayor and leader of the City of London Corporation. Within the City, the Lord Mayor is accorded precedence over all individuals except the sovereign and retains various traditional powers, rights, and privileges. The office of Mayor was instituted in 1189, the first holder of the office being Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone. The Mayor of the City of London has been elected by the City, rather than appointed by the Sovereign, ever since King John issued a Royal Charter providing for a Mayor in 1215. The title “Lord Mayor” came to be used after 1354, when it was granted to Thomas Legge (then serving his second of two terms) by King Edward III. Lord Mayors are elected for one-year terms; by custom, they do not now serve more than one consecutive term. Check your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.

Therefore often known to the locals as the most horrible tube station in London with maze-like levels and platforms. Hence, the Bank-Monument Station is definitely one to avoid during rush hour – we reached here after 10 am. While the underground is chaotic, above it are some of the nicest architectural buildings around. The classic examples would be Mansion House, a government office, and Royal Exchange being an upscale shopping mall. And for something modern would be Lloyd’s of London, the Gherkin and Leadenhall Building (it was under construction when I was there). Their unique design definitely stands out against other office buildings. The Fryer’s Delight is a well-known fish and chips place in Holborn according to my research, amid garnering a rather mixed review. What better way to find out than trying it then? The tastiest fish & chips in town read the signboard and I certainly hope so. The dated interior with Formica-topped tables and old-school menu up on the wall has a genuine retro feel. As for the taste of this classic British fare at The Fryer’s Delight, I personally find it to be rather bland and not to my liking. Perhaps I am too used to the taste of Fish & Chips served at those western food stalls back home… Next up is to check out London’s major shopping streets. Oxford Street is often considered as the busiest street with major department stores like Selfridges, John Lewis, Primark etc. Not forgetting numerous flagship stores of major brands as well as many smaller shops. The wide ranges of choice from local to international designers are amazing. The shops on Oxford Street are geared to lighten any shoppers’ wallet. Hence, keep a sane mind when shopping around here ya! If that is not enough, the upmarket Bond Street is not too far walk away. Here‘s where all the prestigious high-end brands congregate, catering to deep wallets and extravagant tastes. After what seems like an eternity waiting for wifey and her shopping, it is finally time for dinner, and Italian it will be. Literally a stone’s throw from Oxford Circus station, this modern family-run restaurant serves some great Italian food, like the wonderful pasta we had. Thereafter, we made our way to Piccadilly Circus, one of the famous sites in London. And there is no performing circus anywhere nearby too. The word ‘circus’ is being used in reference to the Latin Circle if anybody is puzzled by its name. It is more of a street junction with bright illuminated advertisements. But the whole place is bustling with traffic, pedestrians, and tourists alike. The somewhat chaotic scene is perhaps the reason for a local phrase, “It’s like Piccadilly Circus”. We went on to check out London’s buzzing Chinatown and the happening Leicester Square before it started to pour like crazy. So we decided to head back to the hotel and conclude the last night in London. Mansion House is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London.

the relationship between the roles of brca genes in dna repair and cancer predisposition,"['Inherited mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with a markedly increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Exactly how these mutations cause this increased risk has been the subject of much research over the last 20 years. Learning more about the functions of these genes could help us develop prophylactic strategies to reduce this risk in BRCA mutation carriers—as well as better chemotherapeutics to treat tumors that harbor BRCA mutations. Germline mutations of the\xa0breast cancer 1\xa0(BRCA1) gene are a major cause of familial breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression. Germline mutations of the\xa0breast cancer 1\xa0(BRCA1) tumor suppressor are a common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein harbors an N-terminal RING motif characteristic of many ubiquitin E3 ligases and two BRCA C terminus (BRCT) motifs that form a phosphoprotein recognition domain (1–4). BRCA1 interacts with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) to form a potent E3 ligase (5,\xa06) that is thought to regulate multiple pathways, including those responsible for tumor suppression (1–4). To test whether the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is essential for tumor suppression, we examined mice that express Brca1FH-I26A, an enzymatically defective protein with a missense mutation (I26A) in the RING domain that allows assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer but abrogates its E3 ligase activity (7,\xa08). (Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr. In the mutants, other amino acids were substituted at certain locations; for example, I26A indicates that isoleucine at position 26 was replaced by alanine.)\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/+and\xa0Brca1FH-WT/+\xa0mice were generated from isogenic embryonic stem (ES) cells that express either Brca1FH-I26A\xa0or the corresponding wild-type Brca1FH-WT\xa0protein (9) and bred to homozygosity.\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A\xa0pups were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and survived to adulthood. Because Brca1-null mice invariably undergo embryonic lethality (10,\xa011), the viability of\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A\xa0mice indicates that E3 ligase activity is not essential for all BRCA1 functions. Nonetheless,\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A, but not\xa0Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT, males are sterile and have smaller testes, and their seminiferous tubules lack elongated spermatids and spermatozoa (fig. S1), which suggests a block in spermatogenesis. Apart from male sterility and a modest decrease in adult body weight (5 to 10%),\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A\xa0mice appear indistinguishable from their\xa0Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT\xa0littermates. Moreover, analyses of\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A\xa0mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed that the I26A mutation had no measurable effect on cellular proliferation, chromosomal stability, senescence induction, centrosome number, spindle formation, resistance to genotoxic stress, or ubiquitin foci formation at sites of DNA damage—unlike the hypomorphic Brca1 lesions in MEFs of\xa0Brca1tr/tr\xa0(12) and\xa0Brca1Δ11/Δ11\xa0mice (13), which are known to disrupt tumor suppression (fig. S2). To evaluate whether the E3 ligase activity affects tumor suppression, we initially used a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which the\xa0Pdx1-cre\xa0transgene triggers KrasG12D\xa0and p53R172H\xa0expression in pancreatic progenitor cells (14). To test whether Brca1 suppresses formation of these tumors, we generated\xa0Pdx1-cre animals carrying\xa0KrasLSL-G12D\xa0(14) together with conditional-null\xa0Brca1flex2\xa0(15) and/or\xa0p53flex7\xa0(16) alleles. Although double-mutant\xa0KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre\xa0mice succumbed to pancreatic tumors with an average latency (T50) of 68 days, tumor latency was dramatically reduced in triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) with conditional-null\xa0Brca1flex2\xa0(T50\xa0= 40 days;\xa0P\xa0< 0.0001), indicating that wild-type Brca1 suppresses pancreatic tumor development (Fig. 1A). In contrast, triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Pdx1-cre) expressing\xa0Brca1FH-I26A\xa0developed pancreatic tumors with a similar latency (T50\xa0= 65 days) as that of double-mutant\xa0KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre\xa0mice (T50\xa0= 68 days;\xa0P\xa0= 0.2595) (Fig. 1A). Thus, the tumor suppression potential of enzymatically inactive Brca1 in the pancreas is indistinguishable from that of wild-type Brca1. Fig. 1. \xa0 The enzymatic activity of Brca1 is dispensable for tumor suppression.

These graphs (as well as those in Figure 3) show the percentage of mice that have survived tumor free (Y-axis) after a certain amount of time (X-axis). The researchers made note of how many mice were tumor-free each day, and then translated these data into a graph at the end of the study period. The T50 numbers shown are the times it took for half of the mice to develop tumors. The higher the T50, the better that mouse (or more specifically here, that BRCA1 allele) is at suppressing tumor formation. Note that the X-axes for these panels are very different in scale because the breast tumor models (panels B, C, and D) take much longer to develop compared to the pancreatic tumor model (panel A). In this mouse pancreatic cancer model, the mice have mutations in the oncogene KRAS and the tumor suppressor p53, in addition to different alleles of BRCA1. The flex2 allele of BRCA1 is a null mutation (completely defective), while the I26A allele is a hypomorphic mutation that only abrogates BRCA1 enzymatic function. Notably, the I26A allele (red) is just as effective at suppressing tumors as the normal BRCA1 (black). Notice in the key that the red curve has a flex2 and I26A allele. This mouse is a heterozygote, meaning it has two different copies (alleles) of the BRCA1 gene. Even though this mouse has one defective copy of BRCA1 (flex2), the single I26A copy is sufficient to provide normal tumor-suppression function. In this breast cancer mouse model, the KRAS and p53 mutations are taken out of the equation, and only the BRCA1 mutation is considered. Notice that the scale of the X-axis is eight times as large as the X-axis in panel A. The absence of the background mutations may in part account for the longer latency of \xa0the tumor-free state in the breast cancer model (relative to the prostate cancer model). In fact, all of the mice with the I26A mutation remained breast tumor-free during the experiment. Something else to notice about the X-axis: This experiment took 2 years to complete! That\'s about the average lifespan of a lab mouse, so they were observed for their entire lifetime. This is another breast cancer model, but the p53 mutation is present in addition to the different BRCA1 alleles. KRAS is normal (not mutated). The X-axis here is shorter than that of B (only BRCA1 mutations), but longer than that of A (KRAS, p53 and BRCA1 mutations). For comparison, the T50 of the flex2/flex2 mice (BRCA1 null mutant) without p53 or KRAS mutations was 512 days (C, blue). Adding the p53 mutation reduced it to 309 days (B, green). Adding the KRAS and p53 mutations and moving the tumor induction to the pancreas reduced the T50 to only 40 days (A, blue). This gives you a sense of how cancer is a genetic disease involving multiple mutations. As the mutations accumulate and alter multiple cellular pathways (cell division, cell signaling, DNA repair, etc.), the cancer becomes more aggressive. Here, the researchers looked at spontaneous tumor formation instead of inducing specific tumors of the breast or pancreas. The time scale here is comparable to the experiment in B, most likely because in both D and B, the KRAS and p53 mutations are not present, just different BRCA1 alleles. The authors also introduce another mutant, the truncation (tr) mutant of BRCA1, which lacks the critical BRCT domains at the C-terminus of the protein. Notice that mice bearing this mutant are much worse off than the normal (black) or I26A mutant (red) mice. The tr mutant looks similar to the flex2/flex2 null mutant (B, green), and they have comparable T50s. We next applied a mouse model of familial breast cancer in which the\xa0Wapcre\xa0gene elicits mammary-specific inactivation of the conditional-null\xa0Brca1flex2\xa0allele (15). However, unlike\xa0Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+\xa0females, which form tumors resembling the basal-like breast carcinomas of human BRCA1 mutation carriers (15), all mice expressing enzymatically inactive Brca1 (Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Wapcre/+) remained tumor-free over the 24-month observation period (Fig. 1B). We also monitored three cohorts of\xa0Wapcre/+\xa0mice sensitized for tumor development by a conditional\xa0p53\xa0mutation (p53LSL-R270H). Whereas mammary tumors developed in control\xa0p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females with an average latency of 380 days, which is consistent with previous studies (17), tumor formation was accelerated (T50= 308 days) by conditional Brca1 inactivation in\xa0Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females (P\xa0< 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of tumor development in\xa0Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females was indistinguishable from that of control\xa0p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females (P\xa0= 0.7502) and significantly slower than that of\xa0Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females (P\xa0< 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, representative oligonucleotide microarray analysis (18) revealed a “simplex” pattern of genomic copy number variation in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+\xa0tumors, similar to that of\xa0p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+\xa0tumors but distinct from the “complex sawtooth” pattern of\xa0Brca1flex2/flex2/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+\xa0tumors (fig. S3). Thus, mammary-specific loss of Brca1 enzymatic activity does not promote basal-like breast carcinoma in a manner analogous to complete Brca1 inactivation. Although mice lacking Brca1 enzymatic activity (Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A\xa0and\xa0Brca1FH-I26A/–) are viable, some (18.6%) died of tumors at a very advanced age (Fig. 1D). However, the frequency and kinetics of spontaneous tumor formation in the mutant mice were comparable with those of\xa0Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT\xa0control animals (P\xa0= 0.5197) and significantly lower than those of\xa0Brca1tr/tr\xa0mice (P\xa0< 0.0001) (12). Thus, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for tumor suppression in each of the three GEM cancer models. The BRCT motifs of BRCA1 form a phospho-recognition domain that preferentially binds the phosphorylated isoforms of repair proteins Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP (1,\xa02). Because most tumor-associated BRCA1 alleles have frameshift/nonsense mutations that eliminate one or both BRCT motifs, BRCT phospho-recognition may be critical for tumor suppression. Indeed, in some families breast cancer susceptibility can be ascribed to missense mutations that cause a single amino acid substitution (for example, S1655F) that disrupts the interaction between the BRCT domain and its cognate phospho-ligands. Structural studies show that BRCA1 residue S1655 donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate group of these phospho-ligands, and that mutation of this residue disrupts their interaction with BRCA1 (19–23). To determine whether BRCT phospho-recognition is required for genome stability and tumor suppression, we mutated the corresponding mouse residue (S1598F) to generate heterozygous (Brca1S1598F/+) and homozygous (Brca1S1598F/S1598F) ES clones (fig. S4). The Brca1S1598F/+\xa0ES cells were injected into blastocysts to derive germline chimeras, and heterozygous animals were then intercrossed to produce homozygous\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0offspring, which appeared at the expected Mendelian ratio. Apart from male sterility, these mice developed normally and provided a source of Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0MEFs. The mutant Brca1 protein of\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0MEFs is expressed at normal levels and fails to bind Bach1/FancJ (Fig. 2A).\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0ES cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress (Fig. 2B) and defective for homology-directed DNA repair (Fig. 2C). In addition,\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0MEFs display proliferation defects, chromosomal instability, centrosome amplification, and diminished recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage (figs. S5 and S6). Thus, the S1598F mutation disrupts BRCA1 function in the DNA damage response. To evaluate its effect on tumor suppression, we monitored an experimental cohort of Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females and control cohorts of the\xa0p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+,Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+, and\xa0Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0females described above (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in\xa0Fig. 3A, mammary tumorigenesis was accelerated in experimental\xa0Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0mice (T50\xa0= 308 days) relative to\xa0p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+\xa0animals (T50\xa0= 380 days;\xa0P\xa0< 0.0001), and the shortened latency was indistinguishable from that of\xa0Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+animals (T50\xa0= 309 days;\xa0P\xa0= 0.4543). Thus, the S1598F mutation impairs mammary tumor suppression to a comparable degree as does complete Brca1 inactivation. Pancreatic tumor formation in mice expressing Brca1S1598F\xa0(KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/S1598F/Pdx1-cre;\xa0T50\xa0= 45 days) was also accelerated relative to those expressing wild-type Brca1 (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre\xa0mice;\xa0T50\xa0= 68 days;\xa0P\xa0< 0.0001) (Fig. 3B) and comparable with conditional-null Brca1 mice (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) (T50\xa0= 40 days;\xa0P\xa0= 0.2632). Furthermore, homozygous\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0mice were highly tumor-prone (49 out of 72; 68.1%) relative to control animals (P\xa0< 0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Thus, BRCT phospho-recognition is critical for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression in all three GEM cancer models. Fig. 2. The BRCT phospho-recognition property of Brca1 is critical for the DNA damage response. (A) S1598F ablates the interaction between Bach1/FancJ and endogenous Brca1. MEFs were prepared from mice with a knock-in allele (Bach1WT-FH) encoding wild-type Bach1 with C-terminal Flag-hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes. Bach1WT-FH\xa0and Brca1 levels were examined by immunoblotting lysates of\xa0Brca1+/+/Bach1WT-FH/+and\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F/Bach1WT-FH/+\xa0MEFs (left). To evaluate the Brca1/Bach1WT-FH\xa0interaction, lysates were immunoprecipitated with a Brca1-specific antiserum or corresponding preimmune serum (pre) and immunoblotted with HA-specific antibodies (right). The input (left) represents 2.5% of the protein amount used for immunoprecipitation (right). (B)\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0cells are sensitive to genotoxic stress. ES cells proficient (Brca1+/–\xa0and\xa0Brca1S1598F/+) or deficient (Brca1S1598F/S1598F) for BRCT phospho-recognition were examined for mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity in clonogenic survival assays, together with ES cells homozygous for the hypomorphic\xa0Brca1Δ223-763\xa0mutation. (C) BRCT phospho-recognition by Brca1 is essential for homology-directed DNA repair.\xa0Brca1+/–,\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F, and\xa0Brca1Δ223-763/Δ223-763\xa0ES subclones containing the direct repeat–green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) substrate integrated into the\xa0Pim1\xa0locus were transfected with either an\xa0I-SceI expression vector or empty vector.\xa0I-SceI strongly induced the number of GFP-positive cells in\xa0Brca1+/–\xa0cells (clone 4), indicating efficient homology-directed repair, but not in\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0cells (clones 1 to 3). The reduction in GFP-positive cells in\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0cells was similar to that of\xa0Brca1Δ223-763/Δ223-763\xa0ES cells (clone 5), which are known to be deficient in homology-directed repair (28). This Figure examines the cellular effects of a mutation (S1598) that ablates the BRCT phospho-recognition property of BRCA1. This technique allows researchers to look at protein-protein interactions. First, one protein is isolated or ""pulled down"" using an antibody that targets that protein. Next, the pulled-down material is analyzed for the presence of a second protein, using another antibody that targets that protein. If a band appears in a particular lane of an IP, the two proteins interact under the particular conditions of that lane. Here, the authors ran an immunoprecipitation assay to test for interactions between BRCA1 and one of its know BRCT phospho-ligands (called BACH1 or FANCJ). They started by pulling down BRCA1 protein, and then looked to see if BACH1 was present (bound to BRCA1). The box on the right is the most important: When BRCA1 is normal (+/+), BACH1 interacts with it. In the S1598F mutant (SF/SF), BACH1 is not present, indicating that the interaction between these two proteins is abolished by this mutation. This is an analysis of sensitivity to a DNA damaging agent, mitomycin C (MMC). MMC induces covalent links between DNA strands, which can cause problems during DNA replication. If a cell is deficient in DNA repair, this damage will accumulate and start to kill the cells. The authors compared cells with different alleles of BRCA1 to see which ones best survived treatment with MMC. The cells with at least one copy of normal BRCA1 (open squares and black diamonds) survive fairly well until the highest doses. In contrast, the S1598F mutant and another mutant, Δ223-763, do not survive MMC treatment. This result indicates that the cells with those BRCA1 mutations are defective in DNA repair. Notice the Y-axis is logarithmic, meaning the scale changes as you move up or down the axis. This is another analysis of DNA repair capability. The authors designed a construct that can code for the fluorescent protein GFP. But it is set up in such a way that it can only express the protein if it is cut and then repaired by homology-directed repair. I-SceI is an enzyme that cuts DNA at a specific sequence in the GFP construct. If homology-directed repair is functional, GFP expression will increase after I-SceI is added. The only clone where this is the case is #4, which is also the only clone with a normal (+) copy of BRCA1. The others have mutant BRCA1 proteins, and are therefore defective in homology-directed repair. Fig. 3. BRCT phospho-recognition is essential for Brca1 tumor suppression.

(C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves of\xa0Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT\xa0(black curve) mice compared with\xa0Brca1tr/tr\xa0(blue curve;\xa0P\xa0< 0.0001) and\xa0Brca1S1598F/S1598F\xa0(green curve;\xa0P\xa0< 0.0001) mice. To make the S1598F mutant mice, the authors created mutant forms of BRCA1 and introduced them into embryos. For a simplified explanation of how scientists create mice with specific mutations using embryonic stem cells, watch this video. Figure 3 uses the same Kaplan-Meier curves and the mouse cancer models used in Figure 1. Panel A \xa0is analogous to Figure 1C in that the authors are using the same model. Here, the authors show that mice with the S1598F mutation survive the induced breast cancer as well as those with null mutations (flex2) in BRCA1. Here, the authors have induced mutations in both KRAS and p53 in pancreatic tissue. The corresponding panel (identical mouse model) is seen in panel A of Figure 1. When either a null mutation (flex2) or the hypomorphic S1598F missense mutation is introduced into BRCA1, the tumor-free survival time decreases as compared to the normal copy of BRCA1. As with the different panels in Figure 1, the X-axis in panel B is very different in scale than A. The addition of the KRAS mutation and moving the tumor induction to the pancreas has dramatically decreased the survival time. This figure is analogous to panel D in Figure 1. Instead of inducing tumors in specific tissues, the authors monitored mice with different Brca1 alleles for tumor development in any tissue. Note that the tumor-free survival curve of S1598F-mutant mice resembles that of the BRCA1 truncated (tr) mutant mice. However, the average survival time of both mutants is less than that of normal BRCA1 (FH-WT) mice. BRCA1 is thought to regulate diverse cellular processes by ubiquitinating multiple protein substrates (1–4). Indeed, on the basis of the same mutation (I26A) used here the E3 ligase activity has been implicated in BRCA1 control of centrosome duplication (24), checkpoint activation (25), mitotic spindle assembly (26), and tumor cell motility (27). In light of these observations, the viability of mice lacking BRCA1 enzymatic activity was unexpected. Because mice homozygous for null\xa0Brca1\xa0mutations undergo embryonic lethality (10,\xa011), our results suggest that the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for much of normal development. Thus, many of the known and unknown functions of BRCA1 may be mediated independent of its ability to catalyze ubiquitination. From a medical standpoint, the key function of BRCA1 is its ability to suppress tumor formation in breast and ovarian tissues. Like BRCA1, many other oncoproteins and tumor suppressors possess enzymatic activity. In most cases, the enzymatic function has proven to be integral to the oncogenic process, and in some cases it can be targeted for therapeutic gain, as illustrated by the clinical success of certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, because enzymatically inert Brca1 is sufficient to suppress tumor formation in several settings (Fig. 1), including a model of human basal-like breast cancer, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 appears to be dispensable for tumor suppression. A role for the E3 ligase activity in BRCA1 tumor suppression was predicated partly on the fact that this activity is ablated by certain tumor-associated lesions of the RING domain, such as the C61G and C64G missense mutations (6). However, these mutations also disrupt the interaction between BRCA1 and its partner protein BARD1 (5). Because mammary-specific inactivation of either\xa0Brca1\xa0or\xa0Bard1\xa0elicits breast tumors with the same basal-like phenotype (15), the tumor suppression activity of BRCA1 is probably mediated by the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. Unlike the tumorigenic C61G and C64G mutations, the synthetic I26A mutation used in this study specifically ablates the enzymatic activity of BRCA1 but allows proper assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (7). Thus, the tumorigenic RING mutations are likely to compromise BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression primarily by impairing BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimerization. The mouse model of hereditary breast cancer has provided meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. First, the identical pattern of breast carcinogenesis in conditional\xa0Brca1-,Bard1-, and\xa0Brca1/Bard1-null mice implies that tumor suppression is dependent on the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (15). Second, as shown here tumor suppression does not require the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1. Third, our data also suggest that the ability of the BRCT domain to bind its phospho-ligands is critical for BRCA1 tumor suppression. In light of this result, it is noteworthy that BRCA1/BARD1 forms distinct protein complexes (A, B, and C) based on BRCT-mediated interactions with three different repair proteins (Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP) (1,\xa02). Because tumor suppression appears to be dependent on BRCA1 association with one or more of these BRCT phospho-ligands (and/or others yet to be discovered), these interactions may provide valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.

BRCA1 is generally expressed in the cells of mammary glands and other tissues, helping to repair damaged DNA or disrupting cells when DNA cannot be repaired. When BRCA1 is mutated and cannot function and therefore the damaged DNA cannot be repaired on time, the risk of breast cancer will greatly increase [2]. In BRCA1-mutant tumors, the capability of DNA damage repair is decreased, which makes tumor cells sensitive to DNA-damaging drugs; however, high BRCA1 activity weakens the effect of these drugs [3]. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme that detects DNA single-strand breaks and mediates DNA repair. The inhibition of PARP leads to the accumulation of DNA fragmentation, especially in patients with loss of BRCA activity, and results in cells being killed by excessive DNA damage [4]. Preclinical models show that PARP inhibition selectively targets breast cancer cells lacking functional BRCA1 [5]. Accumulating evidence shows that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [6], but it is unknown whether targeted therapy (including PARP inhibition) has the same effect. As reported in the paper entitled “RAD51 mediates resistance of cancer stem cells to PARP inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer” [7] in a recent issue of Clinical Cancer Research, we found that PARP inhibitor (PARPi) only effectively targets BRCA1-mutant bulk tumor cells and RAD51, a gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair [8], mediates this process, but BRCA1-wild-type cancer cells and BRCA1-mutant CSCs are resistant to PARP inhibition. RAD51 knockdown (KD) sensitizes both BRCA1-mutant CSCs and BRCA1-wild-type cells to PARP inhibition. It suggests an effective therapeutic intervention for targeting triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we tested the cytotoxic effect of olaparib (a PARPi) on four TNBC cell lines including both BRCA1-mutant and BRCA1-wild-type cell lines: SUM149, SUM159, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231. As expected, PARPi treatment resulted in fewer viable cells in BRCA1-mutant cell lines (SUM149 and HCC1937) compared with those with wild-type BRCA1 (SUM159 and MDAMB231). However, after 7\xa0days of PARPi treatment in SUM149 and HCC1937 cells, the ALDEFLUOR-positive cells (i.e., CSCs) [9] was enriched, indicating that these cells were not affected by PARP inhibition. We thus performed an exploratory polymerase chain reaction array of 84 key DNA repair genes and found that RAD51 has higher expression in CSCs than in bulk tumor cells in SUM149 cells. We infected SUM149 and SUM159 cells with a doxycycline-inducible RAD51 short-hairpin RNA lentiviral system. Although not affecting CSC populations in SUM159 cells, RAD51 KD sensitized CSCs to PARPi in SUM149 cells. These results support our hypothesis that RAD51 mediates resistance of CSCs to PARPi in BRCA1-mutant and BRCA1-wild-type breast cancer cells. We next determined the effects of PARP inhibition and RAD51 KD in an in vivo model of TNBC. The mice were divided into four treatment groups: vehicle control, olaparib, RAD51 KD (doxycycline water), and combined (olaparib plus RAD51 KD). For the mice injected with BRCA1-mutant SUM149 cells, RAD51 KD and PARP inhibition significantly inhibited tumor growth in the early stage. However, when treatment was given after the tumor grew to a certain stage (2\xa0mm in diameter), PARP inhibition was not effective, whereas the effect of RAD51 KD was still significant. The combination of RAD51 KD and PARPi led to a more robust inhibition of tumor growth. To assess the effects of PARP inhibition on the CSC frequency, serial dilutions of SUM149 cells (control and treated) were re-injected into mouse mammary fat pads [10]. Compared with vehicle control, RAD51 KD alone and combined treatments reduced the CSC frequency by 70% and 90%, respectively. There is a consistent result in BRCA1-wild-type SUM159-injected mice. Together, these results indicate that our therapeutic regimen targets both BRCA1-mutant CSCs and BRCA1-wild-type cells (both CSC and bulk tumor populations), supporting our in vitro findings of the involvement of RAD51 in resistance to olaparib and, importantly, suggesting an effective therapeutic intervention for targeting TNBC. In conclusion, we used in vitro models and mouse xenografts to demonstrate the importance of RAD51 in reversing PARPi resistance of CSCs in BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-wild-type TNBC in this study. Our findings suggest that resistance to PARPi may be overcome by targeting both CSCs and bulk tumor cells. To elucidate the clinical implications, we will further use the breast cancer patient-derived xenograft model to validate our current findings. Furthermore, by targeting RAD51, it may be possible to greatly expand the sensitivity of TNBC to PARPi, beyond those with defective BRCA1 proteins. This novel approach holds potentials for significantly improved therapies for TNBC. Venkitaraman AR. Cancer susceptibility and the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Cell. 2002;108(2):171–82.

The purpose of our study was to identify common and rare events that underlie breast cancer brain metastasis. We performed deep genomic profiling, which integrated gene copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation datasets on a collection of breast brain metastases. We identified frequent large chromosomal gains in 1q, 5p, 8q, 11q, and 20q and frequent broad-level deletions involving 8p, 17p, 21p and Xq. Frequently amplified and overexpressed genes included ATAD2, BRAF, DERL1, DNMTRB and NEK2A. The ATM, CRYAB and HSPB2 genes were commonly deleted and underexpressed. Knowledge mining revealed enrichment in cell cycle and G2/M transition pathways, which contained AURKA, AURKB and FOXM1. Using the PAM50 breast cancer intrinsic classifier, Luminal B, Her2+/ER negative, and basal-like tumors were identified as the most commonly represented breast cancer subtypes in our brain metastasis cohort. While overall methylation levels were increased in breast cancer brain metastasis, basal-like brain metastases were associated with significantly lower levels of methylation. Integrating DNA methylation data with gene expression revealed defects in cell migration and adhesion due to hypermethylation and downregulation of PENK, EDN3, and ITGAM. Hypomethylation and upregulation of KRT8 likely affects adhesion and permeability. Genomic and epigenomic profiling of breast brain metastasis has provided insight into the somatic events underlying this disease, which have potential in forming the basis of future therapeutic strategies.

Brain metastasis is the most common intracranial tumor, occurring in 15–40% of all cancer patients with metastatic disease [1], [2], [3]. The incidence of brain metastasis has increased in recent years, possibly due to prolonged survival of cancer patients receiving aggressive treatments for their primary or systemic disease [1], [2], [3]. Given their overall frequency in the population, lung and breast cancer are by far the most common tumors to develop brain metastases [1], [2], [3]. Epidemiological studies suggest that brain metastases occur with a frequency of approximately 10–16% in patients with breast cancer, although large autopsy studies indicate that frequencies may be as high as 18–30% [2], [3], [4], [5]. Brain metastases occur rapidly, usually within 2–3 years following diagnosis of systemic metastatic disease, and the median survival once there is brain involvement is a stifling 13 months with fewer than 2% of patients surviving greater than 2 years. Breast cancer involving the brain (parenchyma or leptomeninges) is considered a feature of late-stage progressive disease for which few effective treatments exist. Due to limitations imposed by the blood brain barrier (BBB), chemotherapy has not generally been used to treat most epithelial cancers that metastasize to the brain. Whole brain radiation can provide a survival benefit of 4–5 months, which can be further extended with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Surgery can also lead to dramatic improvements in survival if fewer than three metastases exist and all are treated aggressively with surgery or SRS. Currently there are few predictive measures for identification of patients at risk for developing brain metastasis from their primary cancer. In general, the development of brain metastases from breast cancer depends on several prognostic factors, including younger age, ethnicity, hormone receptor negative status, presence of BRCA1 germ-line mutations, and the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) proto-oncogene, all of which contribute to an increased rate of brain metastasis [2]. The overall goal of our study was to utilize array-based technologies to assemble a compendium of genomic and epigenomic events in a series of breast cancer brain metastases to understand the landscape of breast cancer brain metastatic lesions. The compendium would be interrogated for common and uncommon abnormalities in order to identify potential new therapeutic targets to control this fatal manifestation of breast cancer. Retrospective fresh-frozen samples of breast brain metastases (BBM) were obtained from The University of Toronto Nervous System Tissue Bank, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada (n\u200a=\u200a23) and from The Department of Neurosurgery's brain tumor bank, University of Iowa Medical Center, Iowa City, Iowa (n\u200a=\u200a12). Non-neoplastic brain samples were also obtained from the University of Toronto Tissue Bank (n\u200a=\u200a2) and from The Department of Neurosurgery, University of Iowa Medical Center (n\u200a=\u200a8). Ten non-neoplastic breast tissue specimens were purchased from Asterand (Detroit, MI). A series of 50 early-stage (grade 1 and 2) breast cancer specimens were obtained from the Manitoba Tumor Bank, Winnipeg, Manitoba. All samples were obtained under appropriate ethical procedures and informed patient consent at the respective institutions. All human biospecimens used in this study were pre-existing and de-identified before shipment to the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) for genomic analysis. TGen investigators did not have access to patient identifiers at any time before or after completion of the study. TGen investigators and the holder of patient identifiers entered into an agreement prohibiting the release of this information to TGen investigators under any circumstances. Therefore, the biospecimens do not qualify as human subjects and the study is exempt from Institutional Review Board, in accordance with the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRPs) Guidance on Research Involving Coded Private Information or Biological Specimens. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from fresh-frozen tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the following modifications. Approximately 25 mg frozen tissue was pulverized after a brief incubation in liquid nitrogen, then lysed in 180 µL ATL buffer. The sample was further disrupted using a hand-held tissue homogenizer (VWR, Radnor, PA) before adding 20 µL proteinase K solution. Lysates were incubated at 56°C for 72 hours. Following proteinase K treatment, lysates were centrifuged at 17,000× g to pellet particulate material. Genomic DNA was eluted in 100 µL T low E buffer (Teknova, Hollister, CA) and stored at 4°C. Total RNA, including small RNA, was isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol and stored at −80°C. Genomic DNA and total RNA yields and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Genomic DNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA samples were evaluated for integrity using the Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) on a Bioanalyzer 2400 (Agilent Technologies). Only total RNA samples with RNA integrity number values of at least 7 (RIN≥7) were profiled. A total of 10 samples were dropped due to RIN values lower than 7. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed on 19 BBM samples using the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray Kit, 1×1M, which have an average probe spacing of 2.1 Kb (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, 800 ng of experimental and normal female reference (Promega, Madison, WI) gDNA were independently digested with Bovine DNAse I (Ambion) and directly labeled with Cy5-dUTP and Cy3-dUTP, respectively, using the BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling Module (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Labeled DNA was purified using Vivaspin 500 columns (Satorius Stedim Biotech, Goettingen, Germany). Equal amounts of labeled, purified experimental and reference DNA were hybridized to the microarray in a rotary oven at 65°C for 40 hr at a rotation speed of 20 rpm. The slides were washed according to manufacturer's protocol and images were captured using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner set at default settings for array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Scanner images were extracted using Feature Extraction software v.10.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). Log2 data was imported into Agilent DNA Analytics 4.0.81 software for visualization and quality assessment. The aCGH data for 15 of 19 BBM samples, which passed quality control metrics, were segmented using the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm [6], [7]. Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) was then used to identify regions of the genome that were significantly amplified or deleted across the 15 breast brain metastasis samples. GISTIC calculated a statistic (G-score) for the frequency of occurrence and the amplitude of the aberration. The statistical significance of each aberration was computed by comparing the observed G-score to the results expected by chance. Regions with false-discovery rate (FDR) q-values less than 0.25 were considered statistically significant. In addition, copy number variation analysis was performed using Agilent's Genomics Workbench 6.5 software. The Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm was used to flag altered chromosomal regions and breakpoints (ADM-2 threshold of 5.5 within a 5.0 Mb window size containing at least 3 probes and with minimum 0.58 absolute average log ratio for the region). RNA from 35 BBM, 10 non-neoplastic brain (NBn) and 10 non-neoplastic breast (NBr) tissues were profiled using Agilent whole human genome 4×44K mRNA expression microarrays. A quick-amplification kit (Agilent Technologies) was used to amplify and label 500 ng target mRNA species into complementary RNA (cRNA) for oligo microarrays according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each two-color array, a commercial universal reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was labeled with cyanine 5-CTP and cyanine-3-CTP (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Complimentary RNA concentration and labeling efficiency were measured spectrophotometrically. Approximately 800 ng of both Cy5-labeled experimental cRNA and Cy3-labeled universal reference RNA were hybridized to each microarray (adjusting for labeling efficiency). Images were captured using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner set at default settings for gene expression. Scanned images were processed using Feature Extractor v. 10.5.1.1software by applying a LOWESS (locally weighted linear regression) correction for dye bias and background noise was subtracted from spot intensities. To filter the preprocessed data, genes with a background signal higher than feature signal were removed. The PAM50 gene expression classifier is a supervised, centroid-based prediction method to classify breast cancers into intrinsic molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like) using a 50-gene signature. We applied this classifier to samples analyzed on the Agilent 4×44K mRNA expression platform. Normal samples were used as controls. The log ratio values of the probes were collapsed to gene level by taking the median of all probes matching to same gene. A total of 1 µg of DNA from 32 BBM, 12 NBr, 15 NBn samples and 48 early-stage primary breast cancer samples was bisulfite converted with the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and subsequently processed for hybridization onto the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturers' protocols. This array interrogates 27,578 CpG dinucleotides encompassing 14,495 genes. Bisulfite-treated DNA was subsequently amplified, fragmented and hybridized to locus-specific oligonucleotides on the BeadArray. Image processing and intensity data extraction were performed using an Illumina BeadArray Reader. The GenomeStudio Methylation software from Illumina was used for data assembly and acquisition. Methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) alleles were detected by fluorescence signal from single-nucleotide extension of the DNA fragments. Results were interpreted as a methylation ratio (β-value) of methylated signal (M) to the sum of methylated and unmethylated signal (M+U) for each locus. The average β value reports a methylation signal ranging from 0 to 1 spanning completely unmethylated to completely methylated, respectively. A differentially methylated locus was defined by having a statistically significant (p-value≤0.05 after computing a Mann Whitney non-parametric test) average β difference of at least |0.2| between groups. The raw Agilent gene expression array data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE52604 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52604). The aCGH (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.862978) and DNA methylation (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.855629) data are available online at Figshare.com. Gene lists of interest were uploaded into IPA (Ingenuity® Systems, Redwood City, CA) and the Core Analysis workflow was run with default parameters. The Core Analysis provides an assessment of significantly altered pathways, molecular networks and biological processes represented in the samples' gene list. Complimentary (cDNA) was synthesized using 100 ng of total RNA in a 20 µl reaction volume. The Superscript® III First Strand synthesis system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used with the following conditions: 10 minutes at 25°C, 30 minutes at 50°C, 5 minutes at 85°C and 20 minutes at 37°C with RNase H. SYBR green fluorescence was used for the detection of amplification after each cycle using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Mastermix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was subsequently performed on cDNA in a final volume of 25 µl using the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science). The qPCR cycling conditions were as follows: 5 minutes at 95°C for activation of Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase, 10 seconds at 95°C, 20 seconds at 59°C, and 30 seconds at 72°C for 45 cycles. Quantification was based on the number of cycles necessary to produce a detectable amount of product above background. The following primer pairs were used: Histone: forward: 5′-CCACTGAACTTCTGATTCGC-3′, and reverse: 5′-GCGTGCTAGCTGGATGTCTT-3′; GAPDH: forward: 5′-CTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT-3′. For each sample, the delta Ct value was calculated as the difference between the target gene Ct value and the Ct value of the geometric mean of the internal reference controls. The quantity of expression was calculated relative to the average of expression obtained from NBr and NBn samples (n\u200a=\u200a6). The equation used for relative fold-change was 2−ΔΔCT. Copy number validation was completed with the qBiomarker Copy Number PCR Assays (Qiagen) for ATAD2 (Assay ID 28855976), and cMYC (Assay ID 28877687). Samples were analyzed with the qBiomarker SYBR ROX Mastermix (Qiagen). A multi-copy reference assay, the qBiomarker Multicopy Reference Copy Number PCR Assay (MRef, Assay ID 30773761) was performed for each sample and served as the internal reference control. Data were analyzed with qBiomarker Copy Number PCR Assay Data Analysis Software. All PCR reactions were run in triplicate, and melting curve analysis was performed to ensure specificity of the PCR product. Negative (no template) controls were run in parallel to confirm the absence of nonspecific fluorescence in samples. Somatic copy number analysis (SCNAs) was conducted using the one-million feature aCGH platform in 15 breast brain metastases genomes to identify regions of gain or loss. GISTIC analysis identified 18 focal amplifications (Figure 1) and 4 regions of broad amplifications involving 1q, 5p, 8q, 11q, and 20q (Figure 1). Among the genes amplified in the focal regions were a cluster of HOX genes (HOXA7, HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXA11) on 7p15, AKT1 (14q32.33), IGF1R (15q26.3), ERBB2 and NEUROD2 (17q12), all of which have been reported in primary breast cancers (Table S1a, File S1). GISTIC also identified 37 focal deletions involving CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and DMRTA1 (Figure 1, Table S1b, File S1). Four regions of broad deletions included 8p, 17p, 21p and Xq (Figure 1). GISTIC analysis was conducted on Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray data for 15 breast brain metastases. Significant false discovery rates (Q-values) for amplified (red) and deleted (blue) regions are plotted genome-wide. Annotations for a few of the significant regions are shown. Focal amplifications and deletions are annotated in boldface, and broad amplifications and deletions are annotated in non-boldface. Q-values for deleted and amplified genes are displayed along the x-axis on top and bottom of the figure, respectively.

DEG were selected if differential expression was evident between tumor samples and NBn; between tumor samples and NBr but not between NBn and NBr. In addition, DEG were selected based on p-values≤0.05 and a fold-change ≥2 or≤−2. This comparison identified 863 differentially expressed genes (Table S2, File S1). A heatmap was generated in GeneSpring v12.1 to visualize the DEG list, which also shows a clear separation of tumor and non-neoplastic samples (Figure 2A). In order to identify biological concepts altered in the differentially regulated BBM gene list we submitted the gene list to IPA (Ingenuity® Systems) and applied the Core Analysis workflow. The functional analysis portion of the workflow identified biological functions and/or diseases most significantly altered in our DEG list. Significant categories were sorted based on activation/inhibition z-scores to identify the most significant distinguishing categories with respect to up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Fourteen specific functions had increased activation states as evidenced by z-scores ≥2 (Table S3a, File S1). Five of the fourteen functional annotations mapped to the ‘Cell Cycle’ category. The genes defining the five categories and their relationships were visualized as a network in (Figure 2B). ‘DNA repair’ was another noteworthy enriched category. The genes that mapped to this category were also visualized as a network (Figure 2C). Enrichment analysis was performed to annotate further the genes in this category. Two DNA repair processes, ‘double-stranded DNA break repair’ (CDCA5, FGF2, NR4A1, PRKDC, RAD54L, KPNA2) and ‘homologous recombination repair’ (HUS1, PRKDC, RAD54L and RAD54B) were identified and highlighted in Figure 2C. The functional annotation categories for down-regulated genes converged mostly on categories associated with ‘tissue morphology’ and ‘development’ (Table S3b, File S1). A) Hierarchical clustering of 863 genes distinguishing breast brain metastases (BBM, orange ticks) from non-neoplastic breast (NBr, red ticks) and non-neoplastic brain tissue (NBn, blue ticks); B) Cell Cycle Gene Network. Genes that mapped to the ‘Cell Cycle’ categories were used to construct a direct interaction network; C) DNA Repair Network. Genes that mapped to the ‘DNA Repair’ category were used to construct a direct interaction network. Two DNA repair processes are highlighted and connected to genes annotated to those processes. For Figure 2B and 2C, the gene nodes are shaded red in proportion to the degree of upregulation. Gene nodes shaded in green are downregulated. Log2 ratios are listed under the individual nodes. Direct physical interaction relationships are represented by solid lines. Dotted lines represent indirect physical interactions; D) GSEA Enrichment Map. The results from the GSEA analysis comparing 35 breast cancer brain metastases to 10 non-neoplastic brain and 10 non-neoplastic breast were visualized using Cytoscape and Enrichment Map plug-in. The significant gene sets from the C5 gene ontology library are represented with a p-value of ≤0.05 and false discovery rate (Q) of <0.5. Each individual node represents one gene set with the size of node proportional to number of genes in the set and color intensity relates to degree of enrichment (red\u200a=\u200aup in tumor; blue\u200a=\u200adown in tumor). The relative overlap of the number of genes shared by individual nodes is represented by the thickness of the connecting edges. Interesting subgroups in the network are circled and manually annotated; E) Vertical scatter plots showing FOXM1 and AURKB overexpression by qRT-PCR in breast brain metastasis (BBM, n\u200a=\u200a42) compared to early-stage primary breast tumors (n\u200a=\u200a50).

For Figure 2B and 2C, the gene nodes are shaded red in proportion to the degree of upregulation. Gene nodes shaded in green are downregulated. Log2 ratios are listed under the individual nodes. Direct physical interaction relationships are represented by solid lines. Dotted lines represent indirect physical interactions; D) GSEA Enrichment Map. The results from the GSEA analysis comparing 35 breast cancer brain metastases to 10 non-neoplastic brain and 10 non-neoplastic breast were visualized using Cytoscape and Enrichment Map plug-in. The significant gene sets from the C5 gene ontology library are represented with a p-value of ≤0.05 and false discovery rate (Q) of <0.5. Each individual node represents one gene set with the size of node proportional to number of genes in the set and color intensity relates to degree of enrichment (red\u200a=\u200aup in tumor; blue\u200a=\u200adown in tumor). The relative overlap of the number of genes shared by individual nodes is represented by the thickness of the connecting edges. Interesting subgroups in the network are circled and manually annotated; E) Vertical scatter plots showing FOXM1 and AURKB overexpression by qRT-PCR in breast brain metastasis (BBM, n\u200a=\u200a42) compared to early-stage primary breast tumors (n\u200a=\u200a50). Fold expression was relative to expression in non-neoplastic breast or brain samples (n\u200a=\u200a10). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085448.g002 To identify potential transcriptional regulators among the DEG we used the results of the upstream regulator analysis. This part of the Core Analysis workflow connects transcriptional regulators in the IPA database to the differentially expressed genes. Over-connected regulators are scored with a p-value, for gene enrichment, and z-score for degree of activation based on direction of regulation in database and concordance with direction of regulation in DEG. The list of upstream regulators was filtered for ‘transcription regulators’ upregulated (z-score ≥2) and downregulated (z-score≤2). Five specific transcription factors were identified as active and six were identified as inhibited (Table S4a, File S1). One of the inhibited transcription factors was TP53, implying that TP53 signaling is defective in BBM. Among the activated transcription factors, IRF1 and IRF7 seemed to be connected preferentially to genes involved in immune response such as ‘antiviral response’ and ‘antimicrobial response.’ This may indicate a possible infiltration of immune cells in the samples or could reflect an immunogenic response by the tumor cells. Two interesting transcriptional regulators highly scored were FOXM1 and TBX2 that had three commonly regulated genes. We constructed a combined network illustrating the downstream transcriptional functional targets for both transcription factors (Figure S1, File S1). A functional enrichment was performed on the resultant network indicating that the these two transcription factors control the expression of genes enriched for processes such as ‘cell cycle progression’ (p-value 4.1E-15), mitosis (p-value 4.97E-13) and ‘cytokinesis’ (p-value 1.98E-10, Table S4b, File S1). This observation, coupled with the above functional enrichment on the whole gene list suggests that breast cancer brain metastasis gene expression is associated with cell cycle/mitosis and may be driven by FOXM1 and TBX2. Next, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify sets of genes that are coordinately regulated in the BBM samples. The GSEA algorithm identifies gene sets enriched at the top (breast brain metastases) or bottom (non-neoplastic samples) of the ranked list of DEG. We conducted the GSEA analysis using only the c5 gene set library (GSEA | MSigDB), which contains only gene ontology gene sets. There were 109 gene sets significant at a FDR<50% and p-value of ≤0.05 that were upregulated in the breast brain metastases and only one gene set downregulated (full GSEA results can be found in Table S5a–b, File S1). We visualized the above-referenced gene sets using the Enrichment Map plug-in for cytoscape [8]. The enrichment map portrays the GSEA results as a network of gene sets (nodes) connected by edges representing overlapping genes. The enrichment map improves interpretation of GSEA results by allowing for the identification of functional groupings of the enriched gene sets. We manually inspected the resultant clusters and assigned summary labels to individual subnetworks of interest. Some interesting subnetworks enriched in the BBM samples include ‘Cell Cycle/Mitosis’, ‘DNA repair’, ‘Vesicle Processes’, ‘Protein Localization’ and ‘RNA processing’. The only category associated with the non-neoplastic samples was extracellular matrix (Figure 2D). We experimentally validated the expression of FOXM1 and AURKB in 42 breast brain metastasis samples (which included those used in the expression arrays) and in a series of 50 primary breast cancer samples by qRT-PCR. Both FOXM1 and AURKB were significantly upregulated in brain metastasis samples compared to primary breast cancer samples and non-neoplastic samples (Figure 2E). We used the PAM50 gene expression classifier to divide the breast brain metastatic samples into the common intrinsic subtypes known for breast cancer. From this analysis we identified the following subtypes in our sample cohort: 2 (5.7%) Luminal A, 12 (34.2%) Luminal B, 8 (22.8%) Her2+/ER−, 11(31.4%) basal-like, and 2 (5.7%) Normal-like tumors. An unsupervised clustering analysis of the 863 DEG failed to discriminate between the different subtypes (Figure 2A). Therefore, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify DEG between Luminal B, Her2+/ER− and basal-like tumors. A Post-hoc Tukey test and a Benjamini Hochberg multiple correction test were applied to the data. Differences with fold-change <2 were excluded. We excluded tumors classified as Luminal A and normal-like due to a very small sample size. There were 733 DEG between Luminal B and basal-like tumors; 492 DEG between Her2+/ER− and basal-like and 223 DEG between Luminal B and Her2+/ER− (Table S6a–b, File S1). The union of the differentially expressed genes between groups consisted of 774 unique genes (Table S7, File S1) or 886 probesets. Hierarchical clustering using this gene list was able to clearly distinguish the subtypes and six distinct gene clusters were identified (Figure 3, Table S8a–f, File S1). Six distinct clusters were identified and their respective genes further analyzed. Six distinct clusters were identified and their respective genes further analyzed. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085448.g003 The genes in each cluster were analyzed using ToppGene suite and data are presented in tables and as summary word clouds for enriched processes and signatures (Table S9a–f, Figure S2, File S1). Cluster 1, 2 and 6 contained genes upregulated in both the Her2+/ER− and Luminal B subtypes. However, expression was generally highest in the Luminal B brain metastases. Enrichment analysis of genes in clusters 1, 2 and 6 using the ToppFun module of the ToppGene suite reveals genes previously associated with breast cancer signatures [9]. Specifically, those signatures were associated with luminal subtypes and estrogen receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer. Additionally, cluster 1 has overexpression of RET, and ERBB3, which represent possible actionable therapeutic targets. Cluster 2, similar to clusters 1 and 6, contained genes also upregulated across the Her2+/ER− and Luminal B samples. This cluster contained GATA3, which is an ESR1 target gene, but was only expressed in the Luminal B tumors. Of note, in cluster 6, ESR1 was most highly expressed in Luminal B tumors, coincidentally with AR. Basal-like tumors had a negative expression value for ESR1 and AR. We also note highest expression of FLT3 and FOXA1 genes in Luminal B tumors. Expressed highly in both Her2+/ER− and Luminal tumors were the TFF3 and LRRC6. Genes in cluster 3 and 5 were, in general, were preferentially upregulated in the basal-like samples. The gene lists were consistent with known basal-like breast cancer genes and are also known to be lowly expressed in Luminal breast cancer. For example, Keratin 5, 6 and 14, as well as, CDH3 were present in cluster 5. In addition, FOXC1 and CHST3 in cluster 3 and UGT8, and CHODL genes in cluster 5 were among the highly expressed genes in basal-like tumors. Cluster 4 is unique in that it has a number of genes downregulated across the three subtypes, however, there was a more pronounced downregulation in the Her2+/ER− and Luminal B subtypes. Interestingly, this cluster contained a number of proliferation-associated genes, but they were relatively underexpressed. The basal cell marker gene, Keratin 17, is overexpressed in the basal samples across this cluster. WNT pathway members, FZD7 (C3), WNT6 (C4), WNT11 (C5) and FZD9 (4) were all preferentially expressed in basal-like tumors suggesting novel therapeutic opportunities for basal-like breast cancer brain metastases. Her2+/ER− tumors were associated with overexpression of TMEM45b, very reminiscent of a Her2 subtype. While these samples had some commonly expressed genes with the basal-like tumors, such as CLDN8, they were most similar to the Luminal B tumors. They also had the highest expression of TML5, CYP4F8, and PAX9 when compared to the other subtypes. In order to identify alterations in DNA methylation we used the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array. We compared BBM to NBn and NBr tissue and identified 425 differentially methylated loci (DML, Figure 4A, Table S10, File S1). The median methylation values were 0.4, 0.2 and 0.15 for breast brain metastasis, NBn and NBr respectively, indicating that breast brain metastasis was associated with hypermethylation (Figure 4B). Of the 425 loci, 117 were hypomethylated compared with non-neoplastic tissue and 308 were hypermethylated (Table S10). Only 23 of the hypo-methylated loci were associated with CpG islands, compared to 294 hyper-methylated loci, which occurred in CpG islands (Table S10). The 425 DML failed to discriminate between the molecular subtypes (Figure 4A), so we performed an ANOVA analysis to identify differentially methylated loci between the subtypes. A Post-hoc Tukey test and Benjamini Hochberg multiple correction were applied to the data. Differences with β values less than |0.2| were excluded. Due to small numbers of samples, we excluded tumors classified as Luminal A and normal-like. There were 95 DML between Luminal B and basal-like tumors; 71 DML between Her2+/ER− and basal-like tumors; and 13 DML between Luminal B and Her2+/ER− (Table S11a–c, File S1). The union of these loci resulted in 90 unique DML that discriminated between the subtypes (Figure 4C, Table S11d, File S1). When the union of these loci were examined, basal-like tumors had the lowest median methylation (0.32) compared with Her2+/ER− and Luminal B subtypes (0.61 and 0.68 respectively, Figure 4D), including non-neoplastic tissue examined. From these DML we identified a subset of 15 DML that were most hypomethylated in basal-like tumors compared to the other subtypes (Figure 4E–F, Table S12, File S1). This signature represents a potential CpG island hypomethylator phenotype (CIHMP) for basal-like breast brain metastasis and includes ALDH1A3, FANCG, TRIM29 and HOXA11 (Table S12, File S1).

A combined copy number and gene expression based analysis was conducted on 11 individual BBM samples. In brief, the ADM2 gene-level data were matched to gene-level mRNA expression data. Each sample was compared against non-neoplastic tissue as described above. Genes were filtered to include only those with a log2 ratio ≥2 or ≤−2. For copy number data, a filter was applied to the ADM2 log2 ratio to include only those genes with values ≥0.5 or ≤−0.8. The remaining data were then filtered for congruency to ensure consistency in direction of combined data, i.e., genes needed to be amplified/overexpressed or deleted/underexpressed. The combined aCGH and mRNA expression lists for each sample were uploaded into MetaCore software (Thomson Reuters, New York, New York) for functional ontology enrichment, pathway mapping and knowledge mining. Each sample was interrogated with this workflow to identify biological concepts and observations which include single-gene alterations as well as pathway-based alterations. Expert review of data was conducted to identify and prioritize important biology and concepts for each sample (Table S13, File S1). Below we describe the top concepts identified in our samples. We were able to identify at least one specific pathway/concept aberrantly operative in each sample. There were three samples that had alterations, which would predict interference with the ‘autophagy’ pathway. One sample had amplifications in two genes, eiF2AK3 and ATF6, which are crucial members of the ‘endoplasmic stress’ pathway. Multiple alterations were observed in one sample in the ‘WNT signaling’ pathway. Additionally, two samples had multiple alterations in the ‘chromosome condensation’ pathway. Lastly, six samples had amplifications and coupled overexpression of a histone gene cluster involving the genes HF3A and HF3B. We also note a number of interesting genes (number of samples in parentheses) that were amplified and overexpressed: AKT1 (2), ATAD2 (7), AURKA (2), BRAF (3), DERL1 (6), DNMTRB (3), ESR2 (1), FASN (3), TNFRSF12A (2), PSENEN (4), HIF1A (2), IGF1R (1), NEK2A (6), MCL1 (1), PPFIA1 (1), RAF1 (2), PRL (1), RXRA (1), SRD5A2 (1), SUMO2 (1), TYMS (2), UBA1 (1), VEGFA (1), WNT3A (2) and WNT9A (2). Genes of interest (and number of samples) that were deleted and underexpressed were: CTNNA3 (2), ATM (4), TCF4(1), CDKN2A (1), CDKN2B (2), MSH6 (1), RB1 (1) and RPS6KA3 (2), CRYAB (4), HSPB2 (4). We selected the ATAD2 gene for copy number and gene expression validation by qRT-PCR and copy number qPCR assays due to its high frequency of alteration shown by aCGH and gene expression arrays. In addition, its position on 8q24, a known hotspot locus in breast cancer, further suggests the potential importance of this gene. Here we examined 42 breast brain metastases and 50 primary breast cancer samples. The BBM samples included all samples analyzed by aCGH and the gene expression array platform as well as additional samples. These data demonstrate that both metastatic and primary samples had a comparable increase in both copy number and expression of ATAD2 compared to non-neoplastic samples (Figure 5). The copy number data for the cMYC gene, which is also positioned on 8q24, demonstrate gene amplification in 10/15 samples by aCGH, but this was not accompanied by an increase in gene expression. Quantitative PCR for copy number determination in conjunction with qRT-PCR for expression analysis yielded similar findings where there was a noticeable, but similar cMYC amplification in both brain metastasis and primary breast cancer samples without any evidence of gene expression (Figure 5). A) Vertical scatter plots demonstrate a copy number gain of ATAD2 and cMYC by qPCR but with no difference between BBM and primary breast tumors. B) Vertical scatter plots show comparative overexpression of ATAD2 in both primary tumors and primary breast cancer, whereas cMYC is not expressed. None of the comparisons between primary tumors and BBM samples were statistically significant (p>0.05).

None of the comparisons between primary tumors and BBM samples were statistically significant (p>0.05). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085448.g005 Similarly, a combined gene expression and methylation analysis was conducted on a sample-by-sample basis for 11 samples in our cohort. Gene expression and methylation data for each sample were compared against non-neoplastic tissue. Differentially expressed genes with log2 fold-changes ≥2 or ≤2 and which had a corresponding methylation change with delta beta values >|0.2| were used for further analysis. The resultant gene lists were uploaded into IPA and the Core Analysis workflow was run with default parameters. Analysis of Molecular Functions demonstrated (sample number in parentheses) defects in ‘Cellular Growth and Proliferation’ (7), ‘Cellular Development’ (7), ‘Cellular Movement’ (7) and ‘Cell-Cell Signaling Interactions’ (8). Three samples had predicted decreased activity of cell movement and invasion of tumor cells. Two samples had predicted decrease in the motility of hematological cells such as leukocytes and granulocytes and one sample had predicted decreased activity in cell chemotaxis. Hyper-methylated and down-regulated genes most frequently contributing to cell motility and adhesion included: VAV1 (2), PENK (6), EDN3 (6), EDNRB (4), RELN (5) and ITGAM (4). Other genes affecting cell growth and proliferation which were frequently hypermethylated and downregulated included: CDKN1C (6), CDKN2B (3), CCND2 (4) and BANK1 (7). Other genes of interest include USP44 (6), and CRYAB (4), HSPB2 (1). In eight samples, KRT8 (affecting adhesion and permeability of tight junctions) was found to be hypomethylated and upregulated. We used receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to compare the methylation status of BANK1 and CDKN1C in breast brain metastasis samples to a series of 48 early-stage primary breast cancer samples. The areas under the ROC curves were statistically significant for BANK1 (2/2 HumanMethylation27 array probes) and 6/8 CDKN1C methylation probes representing different CpG loci (p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). The data demonstrate differential methylation between primary breast tumors and brain metastases, where the metastatic samples were significantly more hypermethylated than primary tumors. The ROC curves for BANK1 and CDKN1C are shown in Figure 6. These data highlight the importance of the epigenetic silencing of BANK1 and CDKN1C in the development of BBM. The ROC curve is a graph of the true-positive rate versus the false-positive rate using different threshold values. Data plotted represent two BANK1 HumanMethylation27 array probes and 6/8 CDKN1C probes that demonstrate statistically significant differential methylation between BBM and primary tumors. The area under the curve (AUC) and pvalues are indicated on the graphs. The ROC curve is a graph of the true-positive rate versus the false-positive rate using different threshold values. Data plotted represent two BANK1 HumanMethylation27 array probes and 6/8 CDKN1C probes that demonstrate statistically significant differential methylation between BBM and primary tumors. The area under the curve (AUC) and pvalues are indicated on the graphs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085448.g006 There was also hypomethylation and upregulation of six X-linked MAGE genes (1 Basal sample), histone gene cluster (7), DNMT3B (4), and IL20 (5). CHODL was upregulated in basal like tumors and downregulated in Her2 and Luminal B tumors, but we also noted hypermethylation and downregulation of CHODL in four Luminal B tumors. Similarly, TFF3 is highly expressed in Luminal B tumors and TFF1 is hypomethylated and overexpressed in fourLuminal B tumors. We further examined each sample for enrichment in canonical pathways and identified ‘IL8 signaling’, ‘hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation signaling’ and ‘thyroid hormone metabolism signaling’ to be among the most frequently enriched pathways (Table S14, File S1). In particular, enrichment of ‘IL8 signaling’ was due mainly to the hypermethylation and downregulation of several key genes such as ANGPT1, ANGPT2, KDR, ITGAM, ITGB2, PIK3CG, PIK3CD and TEK. BRAF and BCL2 were among the hypomethylated and overexpressed genes in this pathway. We next combined all three datasets to identify genes that had a one-copy deletion, downregulation and hypermethylation in 11 individual samples; this was anticipated to be an indication of tumor suppressor function for these genes. We identified the following genes (chromosome and frequency in parenthesis): BNC1 (15q25, 2), CHODL (21q11, 2), CRYAB (11q23,2), EDNRB (13q22, 1), FHL1 (Xq26, 1), HS3ST3A1 (17p12, 2), KL (13q13, 1), ME3 (11q14, 2), PENK (8q12, 1), PIK3CD (2), SCARA3 (8p21, 2), SCN3B (11q24, 2), SMYD4 (17p,12, 2), SOX7 (8p23, 2). Other candidate tumor suppressor genes included those that demonstrated homozygous deletions and loss of expression. Of 11 samples, only the three basal-like samples had evidence of numerous homozygous deletions, which were as follows: Sample BBM6 - CDKN2A, CDKN2B, DMD, DMRTA1, GTPBP6, PLCXD1, PPP2R3B, SPRY2; Sample BBM9 - DMRT2, DMRT3, DOCK8, KANK1, ODZ1, RB1, SMARCA2, STAG2, VLDLR; Sample BBM15 - ARHGAP24, FBXO11, FOXN2, GABPB1, HABP2, LHCGR, LILRB2, MSH6. One luminal tumor had a homozygous deletion of the QRFPR gene. Similarly, we identified genes that were amplified, upregulated and hypomethylated. These include: CAPN9 (1q42, 3), CEBPG (19q13, 2), CTSE (1q32, 2), DNMT3B (20q11, 2), HIST1H2BJ (6p22, 2), HMGN1 (21q22, 2), IL20 (1q32, 2), MAT1A (10q32, 2), PSCA (8q24, 2), SRMS (20q13, 2) and TSPYL5 (8q22, 2). The brain is a common sanctuary site of metastatic disease in patients with breast cancer and brain metastases are becoming increasingly prevalent as greater control over systemic disease is achieved. Given the poor clinical outcomes of patients with breast brain metastases, there is urgency to better understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of brain metastasis as well as to identify novel targeted therapies. Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive genomics and epigenomics analysis using microarray technology to measure alterations at the level of mRNA expression, DNA copy number and DNA methylation. Copy number analysis identified a number of focal and broad regions of amplifications and deletions. Among the most notable regions of broad gains in our samples were 1q, 5p, 8q, 11q and 20q. Broad-level deletions were identified in 8p, 17p, 21p and Xq. Previous studies have shown that ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were associated with chromosomal gains in 1q, 8q and 17q [10]. Most commonly, deletions in DCIS have been shown to occur in 8p, 11q, 13q, 14q and 16q [11], [12]. In invasive breast cancer, gains of 1q, 6p, 8q, 11q, 16p, 17q and 20q are most common and chromosomal losses have been identified in 1p, 8p, 11q, 16q, 18q and 22 [11], [12]. These data suggest some clear overlap of regions involved in primary breast cancer, but also point towards the emergence of other chromosomal alterations that may be unique to breast cancer brain metastasis. Certainly, concomitant gain of 8q with loss of 8p has been previously described for breast cancer, as well as prostate cancer, and has been associated with disease progression and poor patient prognosis [13]. Known breast cancer oncogenes such as MYC (8q) and ERRB2 (17q), while among the common regions of amplifications, were not among the highly expressed genes in our samples. ATAD2 (8q24), and DERL1 (8q24) were among the frequently amplified and over-expressed genes suggesting they could play an important role in breast brain metastasis. ATAD2 may be a transcriptional coactivator of ESR1 required to induce the expression of estradiol target genes such as CCND1, MYC and E2F1 and may be required for histone hyperacetylation [14]. It has also been identified as a MYC cofactor and correlates with poor breast cancer outcomes [15]. The protein encoded by this gene contains two AAA domains and a bromodomain. AAA family proteins often perform chaperone-like functions that assist in the assembly, operation or disassembly of protein complexes. DERL1 encodes a member of the derlin family of proteins and is thought to participate in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation response and retrotranslocate misfolded/unfolded proteins into the cytosol for proteosomal degradation. Data in breast cancer cells show that DERL1 expression is increased by ER stress while DERL1 knockdown resulted in decreased development of cancer cells [16]. The NEK2A gene on 1q32 was another frequently amplified and over-expressed gene in the samples we analyzed. The gene encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase that is involved in mitotic regulation. It has recently been described to contribute to the growth potential of DCIS and IDC and expression correlated to higher histological grade and lymph node metastasis [17]. Several samples had co-deletion and downregulation of CRYAB and HSPB2 (both on 11q23) due to deletion and/or hypermethylation. CRYAB (B crystallin) and HSPB2 are two members of the multi-gene small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) family that are typically coexpressed in the mammalian heart, but the biological roles remain poorly defined [18], [19]. CRYAB has been implicated in stress-inducible translocation, antiapoptosis, remodeling of the cytoskeleton, cardioprotection and inheritable cardiomyopathy in humans [19]. It has been reported that 11q22-23 is a frequent target for deletion during the development of many solid tumor types, including breast, ovarian, cervix, stomach, bladder carcinomas and melanoma [20], suggesting tumor suppressor functions in solid tumors including breast brain metastases. Integrated copy number and gene expression analysis also reveal BRAF, AKT1, and IGF1R amplifications and deletion/downregulation of ATM, all of which belong to pathways that lend themselves to therapeutic targeting. Differential expression analysis reveals significant ontologic profiles associated with G2–M checkpoint and proliferation. A central player in the G2-M cascade is FOXM1, which was overexpressed in a large percentage of breast brain metastases. FOXM1 is a transcriptional activator involved in proliferation, cell-cycle control, and mitosis, through the regulation of many genes involved in the mitotic checkpoint, such as AURKA, AURKB, PLK1, and CENPF. The FOXM1 gene was also recently highlighted as significantly deregulated in serous ovarian tumors and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer [21]. Our DNA methylation analysis demonstrates an overall increase in methylation compared to non-neoplastic tissue. This is interesting since much more of the cancer genome is generally subject to lower methylation levels rather than higher levels of methylation [22]. Nevertheless, this is consistent with our findings demonstrating upregulation due to amplification and/or hypomethylation of DNMT3B and MAT1A. We did however demonstrate lower overall methylation in basal-like tumors, a finding also consistent with basal-like primary breast cancer (TCGA) [23]. Functional annotation of our epigenetically-regulated genes demonstrates a strong relationship to inflammatory and immunological responses and disorders. We identified a propensity of genes related to both tumor and immune cell migration and adhesion to be epigenetically silenced in a high percentage of samples. This phenomenon could be the result of immune cell infiltration into the brain and/or could be also be explained by the fact that progression of metastatic cells from the blood stream into the perivascular space and then to brain parenchyma share similar mechanisms as those employed by cells of the systemic immune system [24]. The latter scenario can be explained by considering that once cells have colonized the brain, migratory-promoting genes of the tumor cells are repressed, as cells have likely reached their ‘final destination’. This would seem to be accompanied by activation of proliferative genes. However, cancer progression does involve the activation of stromal cells including pericytes, fibroblasts and leukocytes [24]. Extravasation of metastatic cells may cause damage to components of the BBB, which may facilitate entry of systemic immune cells in the perivascular space and are known to have both tumor preventing and promoting roles [24]. Over the last decade, there has been a marked improvement in the understanding of the molecular profile of breast cancer, which has suggested that breast cancer may behave as a multiplicity of diseases [25], [26], [27]. Gene expression studies using DNA microarrays have identified at least four distinct subtypes of breast cancer, including Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+/ER−, and the basal-like subtype [25], [26], [27]. Recent work has shown that compared to the Luminal subtypes, Her2+/ER− and basal-like subtypes have a greater predilection for seeding the brain, a much shorter latency period for doing so and worst overall survival [5], [28], [29]. Applying the PAM50 classifier to our breast cancer brain metastasis series identified a relatively high number of Luminal B tumors compared to Her2+/ER− and basal-like subtypes. Certainly, the availability of samples at the time of accrual could have impacted the frequency of the subtypes in our series. Additionally, since we were not able to obtain the matched primary breast tumors, we were not able to confirm the subtype of the primary tumor to determine if receptor conversion has occurred. However, previous studies have analyzed gene expression signatures known in primary tumors in metastatic tumors [30], [31]. In summary, the breast brain metastases in our series generally appeared to retain molecular features consistent mainly with breast cancer and with their respective subtypes. Identifying changes unique to metastatic tumors will ultimately require study of primary/metastatic pairs. However, whether intrinsic subtype switching has occurred or not, it is clear from this study that molecular signatures resembling those known for primary breast tumors and its subtypes can be identified. Ensuring optimal success for developing novel therapies for breast cancer brain metastases therefore requires consideration of the tumor intrinsic subtype status. Due to the BBB and the unique environment of the brain, novel therapeutic approaches for brain metastases warrant intensive research efforts. Our study has highlighted a number of fundamental genetic and epigenetic aberrations occurring in brain metastases from primary breast tumor with strong implications for future targeted therapies that are aimed at alleviating the burden of this clinically unmet need. Supporting figures and tables. Figure S1: Combined Network for Upstream Analysis of FOXM1 and TBX2. The downstream genes connected to FOXM1 and TBX2 were illustrated as a network in IPA. The mRNA expression ratios are listed below the gene nodes. The legend within figure describes the node and edge color keys. Figure S2: Word Cloud Analysis of Cluster Enrichments. We have used word clouds to visually summarize the textual results from the enrichment analysis of each gene cluster as observed in Figure 3. The results were generated using www.wordle.net web resource. The larger the word, the more times it is mentioned in the enrichment categories. Supplementary Tables in File S1. Table S1a. Table S1b.

These proteins are responsible in aiding to repair damaged DNA. If they are unable to repair this DNA, then they send the cell to be destroyed. Mutations in these genes ultimately mean that damaged DNA is not repaired or destroyed and this can increase the risk for breast cancer. Currently, anywhere between 5-10% of breast cancers are associated to a BRCA mutation. Women with a BRCA mutation have a significantly increased risk of breast cancer. However, what should be noted is that just because women may harbour a BRCA mutation, does not guarantee that they will develop cancer. There are different types of preventative surgeries that could lower the cancer risk for women who have a BRCA mutation, including mastectomies. Although radical mastectomies are a common choice among those with a BRCA mutation, research studies have been unclear whether the surgery is a necessary step. Researchers in the UK conducted a study to determine if women with the BRCA mutation needed to rush and undergo radical surgeries. This study was recently published in the Lancet Oncology and was reviewed by BMJ Research News. This cohort study included 2,733 women who were 40 years old or under when they were initially diagnosed with breast cancer. The researchers analysed the DNA of the participants and found that 12% of these patients had a BRCA mutation. The patients underwent conventional treatment including chemotherapy, breast-conserving surgery, and mastectomy. A follow-up after two years found that overall survival of women with a BRCA mutation (97%) had comparable survival rates to women who did not carry the BRCA mutation (96.6%). These results were consistent at follow-ups at both five years (83.8% vs 85%) and 10 years (73.4% and 70.1%). The researchers found that women who harboured a BRCA mutation in patients with triple-negative breast cancer had a slight overall survival advantage over women who do not carry a BRCA mutation. They concluded that this was not due to having had radical surgery and that the real reason was still unclear. The study also revealed that double mastectomy was not correlated with better survival rate. This research study concluded that a double mastectomy, especially for women diagnosed with breast cancer early on in life, does not seem to confer an advantage for those with a BRCA mutation. She said that this radical and invasive surgery does not have to take place immediately and other treatment options can be undertaken prior to a surgery. It also means that young women with a BRCA mutation and diagnosed with breast cancer can weigh their options to make the right choice for themselves to ensure longer survival rates.

They are involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. If BRCA1 or BRCA2 itself is damaged by a BRCA mutation, damaged DNA is not repaired properly, and this increases the risk for breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been described as ""breast cancer susceptibility genes"" and ""breast cancer susceptibility proteins"". The predominate allele has a normal, tumor suppressive function whereas high penetrance mutations in these genes cause a loss of tumor suppressive function which correlates with an increased risk of breast cancer."
why do we have to celebrate freedom day,"['', 'Freedom day is celebrated on the 27th of April in South Africa to remember the first post-apartheid elections held on that day in 1994. These elections were the first non-racial national elections where everyone of voting age from any race group were allowed to vote. Previously, under the oppressive apartheid regime, non-whites had only limited rights to vote, making this the starting point of the new South Africa we love today. To celebrate this milestone we have compiled a list of interesting places to visit in South Africa that explores its intricate political past. Robben Island\xa0was a prison that housed political prisoners and is\xa0a stunning place to see how our heroes of the struggle\xa0lived for a large period of their lives.\xa0There are daily trips to the island (weather permitting) followed by an insightful guided tour. The tour stretches across the island and you get to visit the cell where Nelson Mandela himself lived. This tragic place will truly help you appreciate your freedom. There are various museums around Cape Town City Centre that can give you a taste of this countries colourful history. From the District Six Museum to the Slave Lodge, South African Art museum and planetarium, there are just so many fun and interesting ways to learn about our past. Constitution Hill is the seat of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and is an old prison with a Museum which includes The Mandela Cell, where Nelson Mandela was housed when he was\xa0incarcerated here. Outside the court building, in the middle of a plaza is the Flame of Democracy, the Flame was lit in 2012 when South Africa celebrated the 15th anniversary of the signing of the constitution. This iconic stretch of road is the only street in the world where two Nobel Laureates once lived. It was home to the legendary Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu and named after the first black South African to receive a PhD, Benedict Vilakazi. You can also visit Nelson Mandela’s old house which has been turned into a museum for people to see where the former president started his journey. Further up the road, on the corner of Vilakazi, there is the Hector Pietersen museum and memorial, highlighting the plight of students during the Soweto uprising. This stunning sculpture is situated in the Donkin Reserve in Port Elizabeth and depicts South Africa’s rainbow nation, coming together to vote and did so peacefully. The metal figures of the sculpture are said to represent all the different kind of communities that are present in South Africa uniting for peace and equality for all. A reminder that South Africans’ can come together for change. As its name suggests, this monument is placed on the spot that Nelson Mandela was captured, after being on the run for 17 months. The sculpture, created by artist Marco Cianfanelli and Jeremy Rose, acknowledges the 50th anniversary of Mandela’s capture. This beautiful structure consists of 50 steel columns between 6 and 9.5 meters high along a thirty-meter length, and can be seen from the road. It is a true testament to the difficult\xa0path Mandela faced on his route to freeing the people of South Africa. There are so many more monuments and museums around South Africa you can visit with your family this Freedom Day and we hope that this list narrows down your favourite.

My girl has hit that stage between children and adult sizes ( leaning more towards adult ) and I had no problem finding patterns that will work for her and all my first picks worked size wise without any adjustments. The School Bella will be attending has some clothing rules. Sewing for school makes things a lot easier. Modern yet modest clothes are really hard to find for the tween, teen age group. How adorable is this pattern? I made no changes in the pattern as I have never sewn it before and I really liked the lines of the shirt for my tween. I love the ruched sides and my next attempt will be a dress. The Notebook paper is my favorite fabric from the back to school line by Raspberry Creek fabrics. I can think of so many cool things you can do with this. I thought a sketched graphic would be awesome or a story line out of a favorite book. Bella did not go for this yet so I kept it simple. I used shoelaces instead of fabric for the drawstrings on the side in yellow and also yellow snaps for the shoulder tabs as it reminds me of a pencil. I love the neckline, it doesn’t drop too low but is still wide enough for easy on and off. Bella loves how we can change the length of the shirt with the drawstrings to adapt to whatever she wears with it. The Metro pants goes all the way up to size 14 . I made a 12 and YAY , that means this will still work for her for a couple more years. I added belt loops, omitted the drawstring and made a belt with it. The fabric is perfectly soft and slinky and the denim color makes it great for matching a whole bunch of shirts. It has pockets!!! The Caraway is a unisex button down cardigan. It goes all the way up to size 12 and I think we will get a couple of years of this one. This will be easy to age up too. It comes in 3 different lengths and she said she would also like the longer one with a belt.  The green goes with all the pieces in this current wardrobe and with a lot of her graphic shirts that she wears so this was a big win for mom – YAY. Yellow snaps on the one side and blue snaps on the other side. Who doesn’t like French Terry – I want to live in French terry in the Fall , winter and spring. Super soft, warm ,yet not too heavy. The Soleil Skirt goes up to 10 but because of the elastic this can  be adjusted to fit well into the teenage/ adult years. I love the faux button placket and the pockets. This will work great for both school and church and can be dressed up or down. With school when make skirts or dresses I want to make sure that she can still play and run around without struggling with movement. If there were to be a showstopper to this collection, this would be it. It is all in the print. When I picked out my prints I knew this is something that she would really like and I love the Grey and Khaki colors as I think we can match this with a lot of shoes and jackets. This girl is all about the jackets and shoes lately. When it comes to the pattern, I’ve sewn the Story pattern a few times already so this was the pattern I was going to modify for my dress. I cut the bodice right below the belly, and when I cut the skirt and the sleeve this is the method I use……. For the skirt I lengthened it a little below the knee. I cut my rectangle pattern piece in 4 evenly spread quarters and opened it up like the sleeve as far as I could with the width of the fabric so I have a almost full circle skirt. I added elastic around the middle so the dress don’t stretch out. Bella is not a dress girl right now but she desperately needs a couple in her closet. She liked it ok as we went through the process but after we took pictures she kept it on for the rest of the day and she admitted that she really likes it and I can sew her a couple more – BIG MOM WIN. That is it for today. Big Thanks to Project Run and Play for having me and  Raspberry Creek Fabrics for sponsoring the fabric. The Raspberry Creek Fabric shop is a go-to for all types of fabrics. Their club fabrics are one-of-a-kind and you will always receive quality fabric.  Follow along for the Back2school blog tour HERE and get some great ideas and inspiration for your Back2School sewing. Till next time………. I love color-blocking when I sew. I like that it makes your garment an unique kind of art. one of a kind, because no matter how you do it, it is in itself perfectly unique. It starts with a vision, what pattern I am going to use, what fabric I have in my stash or sometimes it is something specific and I go searching for the fabric that I need. Once I picked the pattern, I am going to mark my cutlines. For this I recommend a curved and straight ruler. I will be honest and say for curves I rarely use a ruler and just go free hand. Now let’s get to the specific jumpsuit I made for Week 3 of Project Run and Play’s Mini season 2. It was definitely a challenge with lots of thinking involved but a very fun one indeed. It’s like a puzzle fitting together. I mashed up two different patterns for the jumpsuit. Both are from Project Run and Play’s Lounge Library collection. For the bodice I used the Biography Bomigan Pattern and for the bottom I used the Prose and Poetry Cargo Joggers Pattern. I laid out my patterns and decided where my colors was going to go. Every extra color blocked line that you added is going to need seam allowance. For my top part I knew I was cutting on the fold and my pants had seam allowance so I had to adjust for that and make sure they will line up. NOW you are ready to cut your fabric. With color blocking I recommend taking your time, check and check again before you cut. Make sure you have the right color and make sure you know if you should have the pattern piece right side facing you or if it needs to be flipped. REMEMBER TO ADD YOUR SEAM ALLOWANCE TO EVERY LINE YOU HAVE ADDED TO YOUR PATTERN. Pattern pieces have seam allowance in already but if you added a line you will have to cut extra seam allowance JUST ON THE LINES YOU ADDED. When you change a pattern that has an open front like the Biography to a one piece you need to fold your pattern piece in and add your ” place on fold of fabric” to your pattern. Once you have your pieces cut, you can start assembling. I add those lines right through my color block line so when I cut my fabric I cut my diamond notches and I usually have at least two or more on one line. Press your seams after every seam you sewed. When I am working with a knit fabric, I always mostly use my serger but when I color block and I sew front and back pieces together that has a color blocked seam I pin it together, sew it together with my sewing machine first and then serge. The serger has a way of pushing one fabric out before the other with knit and because you can’t serge over pins like a normal sewing machine, go ahead and sew it together with the sewing machine first. That way it gives you good sides that matches up. and press, press, press those seams always. I hope this tutorial was helpful and if you haven’t tried it yet, you should. Happy Color blocking…….till next time. I am so glad to be here this week. It’s been a rough past couple of weeks full of loss but here I am and sewing always has the ability to put me in a better mood. Creating helps me process things too.\xa0 I am going to jump right in…. The very first thing that came to my mind for comfort was a jumper in soft terry fabric. Bella child loves a good jumper and would live in them if she cans. The patterns I picked was the Prose and poetry jogger pattern for the bottom and the Biography bomigan pattern for the top. There were quite a bit of thinking and taking my time in assembling the jumpsuit but there were no major issues and both my daughter and myself is in love. I would love to have a version like this for myself. I already knew the fit of both the patterns which made things easier. I omitted the waistband of both the  jacket and pants. I added pockets where the fabric meets between the bottom and top part and used mint green fabric for the inside of the pockets. I added elastic on the inside of the middle, bronze grommets and a mint green shoelace for the string around the middle. I added a zipper to the raglan shoulder seam with a folded over lining flap so the zipper’s teeth doesn’t bother her on the inside. the neck was finished with bias binding that was folded in and stitched around. The color-blocking took some thinking so I cut and sewed part by part to make sure all my pink is on the one side and my mustard on the other. The jacket is a flip on the Story top pattern . Another favorite from the library lounge pattern collection. I used an active knit I had ordered way too much from and quilted the bodice pieces together with fleece and diamond top stitching. The jacket is fully lined with a minty green knit on the inside. I split the story in the front and added a zipper. The hood is from the George hoodie and it worked out perfect. A mint green shoelace is threaded through the bottom so she can cinch it in the waist if she wants to. I love it when an idea I have in my head turn out just like I  imagined. My favorite parts are the pop of mint everywhere. She can easily hang out at the house or out shopping . Style and Comfort all in one. Now head on over to http://www.projectrunplay.com/2021/01/mini-season-2-week-3-comfort.html to go look at what Tami from SewSophieLynn created ( so comfortably beautiful ) and vote………. The Fifth Project Run and Play collaboration released just a couple of weeks ago. It is a collection of patterns, designed by a talented group of designers, to create a lounge wardrobe for children everywhere. It is my favorite creative collaberation every semester. All the designers picked a story and we base our looks off the story. I love so many children’s books but I came back to the book ISH by Peter H Reynolds. It’s about a boy Ramon and his journey from a bad remark from his brother all the way through to him enjoying art again after his sister shows him the world of ish. Leon burst out laughing. “What is that?” he asked. Bella  loves comfy and even though I would love to sew all the dresses , she does not like to wear dresses anymore. She likes the idea of them but does not wear them so I chose all the comfy patterns to sew. Leon’s laughter haunted Ramon. but they never did. Ramon put his pencil down. “I’m done.” he saw his sisters’ walls…. He stared at the crumpled gallery. “They do look……ISH,” he said. Ramon realized he could draw ish feelings too. My Friends know ish is one of my favorite words. I use it often . I would much rather live up to my own perfect ish than the world’s “right” . The book, ISH is a great tool in guiding children through frustration on getting things “right”. The patterns are fantastic and the interpretations of the designers always puts a smile on my face and inspire me in my own creative journey. Till next time…………. Project Farmer’s Market capsule wardrobe collection released in March and what an awesome collection. Have you seen the lookbook  yet ? So many ways to mix and match and suitable for a wide age range, appropriate for all seasons by layering and many options for both boys and girls. I sure love a pattern that I can use for both my kids. The idea of a capsule wardrobe is very appealing as it makes it easier to drop and add an item at a time as my kids grow which means I don’t have to sew/replace a whole wardrobe every season. I was lucky enough to test the Jonagold Jumper as part of the collection and love the versatility it provides. I love a pattern I can modify and the jumper fits the bill quite perfectly. The possibilities are endless. I used the upbeet tee pattern for under the jumper. The unique lines makes it the perfect tee for color blocking . The fit is very comfortable yet still perfect for layering, I appreciate the length of the shirt for underneath the jumper. I did sew up a few modifications of the jumper and both the tee and jumpers are in heavy rotation right now. I am excited to build on her wardrobe with more pieces from the Project Farmers Market collection This is my favorite one and my girl gets so many compliments on it. I modified it by adding pleats to the skirt and embroidered a butterfly on the front piece. The fabric is a light linen and the embroidery holds up so well with washes so don’t be afraid to embroider and wash items you have made. Signature week has arrived. If this is your first stop also head on over to \xa0Project Run and Play\xa0and check out all the other designers looks. For Signature I decided to incorporate a little of my personal style from\xa0 each weekly challenge and then I challenged myself to use a lot of solid colors, very little print and still be bold just like I like it. My signature style very much includes Isabella’s style as she is the one I sew for most of the time and we both have about a 50/50 input into the thought process . We make a great creative team. My very favorite thing is when Isabella wears her mom- made clothes and people compliment her on it and she replies proudly ” My mom made it”\xa0 We both like funky, a little fancy, but also very comfortable. She loves to look like a lady but she wants to be able to dig in the dirt looking like one. Signature for me means lots of colors, different textures and fiber content fabrics, Ankara printed fabric, fiber arts, layers, different techniques and more importantly ONE OF A KIND, my hope is to always stay true to my unique style, It should look handmade but not homemade.\xa0 Can I draft a pattern? Yes, but I also love using patterns from my favorite Indie pattern designers and putting an ArtBella spin on it. This week’s colors are compatible with all the pieces from week one. I chose denim and solids a lot the season so most of the pieces can be worn with separates from different weeks. A\xa0 good friend of mine mentioned that Bella reminds her so much of\xa0Punky Brewster\xa0and I completely agree, hence the title. Week 3 is here and I am so very glad to still be here – Thank you! This is my favorite week – Celebrations around the world. You didn’t doubt me picking South Africa, did you? I was very fortunate to be right in the middle of the action ( I was in matric/senior in High School) when South Africa became the Rainbow Nation. Unfortunately 6 months short of voting age but exciting nonetheless South Africans do love to celebrate and it almost always include a braai (barbeque) with lots of meat and good friends around the fire. Is there anything better to celebrate than FREEDOM? Freedom day in South Africa\xa0celebrates freedom and commemorates the first post apartheid elections held on that day in 1994. The elections were the first non-racial national elections where every one of voting age (18 years and older)\xa0including foreign citizens permanently residing\xa0in South Africa,\xa0were allowed to vote. So much thought and emotions went into this outfit so I will try and take it piece by piece. South Africa is very rich in Art and have very vibrant creative people, so I went big on color (just like I like it) The Jumpsuit ( which she can rock at any Barbeque ) – \xa0South Africa\xa0went from a 3 color flag to a very vibrant 6 color flag in 1994 \xa0to represent the people as a new nation so for my jumpsuit I used a golden yellow (South Africa is known for gold \xa0, in fact my dad worked in a gold mine all of his life and I grew up in a miners town)\xa0, white and black linen. If you look at the flag you see where the two green lines from the outer corners joins and become one ( which represents the people from South Africa before apartheid \xa0and the togetherness as one after 1994) \xa0I replicated the symbolism of that in the bodice with the color blocking. To add a bit of blue I added denim. Patterns used was the\xa0Friday dress by Petit a Petit\xa0and the\xa0Graphite trousers by Made by Toya. (two great patterns collided) I used the short sleeve version and for the pants I took away the pleat and widened the bottom legs quite a bit. I finished the whole suit and my girlie loved it, but it felt very boyish to me with the sleeves so a week after finishing it, I \xa0decided to just chop them off and used the gathering method that is used in the\xa0LOL swing top\xa0\xa0to make the fit perfect around the shoulder blades. There is snaps so she can get it off easy at school and belt loops for THE BELT the belt,the belt, how I love the belt. I think it’s my most favorite part. I hand embroidered( Hand embroidery is very popular amongst South African women) those colorful geometric freehand shapes on black linen over the past ten days, during piano-, dance lessons and netflix and I am so glad I started early enough and finished. Fully interfaced so it goes through the buckle and stays in and it is still easy for her to get on. The Jacket – Oi this was my challenge piece but my non-negotiable piece. Bella saw and fell in love with a navy blue adult version at the \xa0J. crew outlet and I thought how awesome a velvet green and gold bomber jacket would be to go with this week. ( If you earn National colors for Rugby in South Africa you earn your green and gold jacket) After sanctions was lifted in 1995 South Africa played their first Rugby World cup in a very long time, South Africa hosted and won the Rugby World Cup. It was the biggest celebration I have ever witnessed. I searched far and wide to get a non-stretch green velvet and finally found some on fabric wholesale direct. I hoard African fabric like its nobodies business and these zebras was perfect for lining. I should have just used a pattern but I wanted a specific look so I used my block to draft and cut the fabric. Fully lined, metal zippers with the pockets and I could not for the life of me find ribbing to go with it for the collar (If I can’t find anything in local shops , my next option is always second hand clothing stores but couldn’t find \xa0anything there either) \xa0and had a genius idea of using gold and black wide elastic and it worked out brilliantly. I used the moto jacket pattern by Jennuine design\xa0to check my fit and proportions, struggled with that zipper on velvet about a thousand times but succeeded, added my label and a hook to hang it on and voila. The skirt was a self-drafted 10 panel skirt, with flat panel in the front and elastic in the back waistband with leather belt loops WITH POCKETS (YAY) and horse hair braid in the hem. Again the fabric was some ankara out of my stash with the perfect colors to represent the flag. Blue was missing so I made a fitted blue\xa0Shirt to match. I also finally perfected the flounce I have been wanting to make on the shirt ( I’ll have to make a tutorial for that) and even changed all my serger thread to royal blue to make the lettuce hem around 2 layers of flounce and my insides all were blue. Accessories – I got so inspired with this outfit that I made some leather and seedbead earrings and bracelet/necklace to compliment the outfit ( beads are very popular to use in crafts as well as hand embroidery amongst South African women) Made her a head wrap, watched a couple of youtube videos on how to get the headwrap on and she was ready to take pictures. This has been the hardest outfit to keep clean and not have her wear it outside to spoil the reveal so now she can finally wear it . You can find more pictures on my blog here\xa0I hope this outfit makes you as joyful to look at as it does me. Week 2 is here – Nature inspired. The Thought process: This one I immediately knew the direction I wanted to go. My very favorite thing about nature is how the leaves change color in the fall and one of my favorite sayings is this Isn’t it awesome and magnificently beautiful how the trees’ leaves just start to change colors and then let them go, \xa0and next spring they grow those beautiful green leaves again?! No matter if it was a bad year, next year is a brand new start. I’ve had the fall rust colored fabric I used for the shirt in my stash forever ( 4 years maybe?!) but that’s where I started . My vision was \xa0a very chic blouse that was princess-style cut with the three panels in the front and instead of the seam lines to go in the direction of the armpit, I directed them to the neck , left a bit open so my girl can get it over her noggin and added a neck tie collar, puffy sleeves with wide cuffs around the wrists with buttonholes (and I didn’t swear)\xa0and buttons. The layer-shedding dress in my head was color blocked panels to resemble the leave color change – in linen fabric ( love the crispness of linen just like fall ) I had some in my stash but had to purchase some more colors \xa0from a local shop. For each challenge I try to incorporate something creative,functional and something that requires some skill. So for the layer shedding effect , I added two open ended zippers so it can shed the skirt just like trees looses their leaves. For this challenge the whole outfit was self-drafted and adapted from a single basic bodice block. I had to make sure the two zippers will fit in correctly in the layer so there is no gap where they meet on both sides and added bias binding to finish it off on the inside. Let me tell you the zipper was not as hard as getting those bottom three layers to match up and still have beautiful matching sides but I channeled my inner Tim Gunn and persevered. The way the colors are matched was not exactly how I wanted it in order but I had to work with the amounts of fabric I had and made it work. TIP of the WEEK – We know we have to pre-wash fabric but sometimes we don’t because we get so excited. If you work with different fabrics in one garment, like this dress and especially the heart shirt I made for week 1 -WASH those fabrics before hand. The fiber content of different fabrics shrinks in different ways, If you want your garment to last, pre- wash at least once, for the heart shirt I washed all my fabrics twice and tumble dried on high so it can get all the shrinking done before you cut. At this stage the \xa0multiple layering process was born. I also made some fall colored pants in a love soft DBP for a more casual look. This outfit solves our issue of the girl who loves a dress in church and at events and restaurants but immediately dresses in pants when we get home. For our photo shoot she just put everything on at once and dropped layer by layer. Timing for some fall colored leaves couldn’t have been more perfect. We headed out to Warnecke woods right here in Princeton, IL and also some at home as I forgot to do the shirt with vest and pants and Wrinkles wasn’t ready yet with out first photoshoot. Wrinkles’ dress is made of all the scrap fabric and some leather scrap from the earrings, metal zipper like Bella’s dress and a off-set neck tie collar. I made some leather earrings (which I am keeping for myself) and a soft wrap headband to accessorize. I only have one child in kid-age clothes so to show you all the looks I had to clone her (Thank you Photoshop) Even with pulling off layers we managed to get in and out of those woods in 10 minutes. On top of all these possibilities, I know that when summer swings around I will add a tank to wear under just the dress and then as she grows just the dress. I love to sew dresses that can be worn with something underneath so we get at least 2-3 years out of it. The tulle skirt she already wore \xa0under another long dress so I know we’ll use that one plenty . Patterns used: the shirt and the bodice of the dress I used the\xa0Building block Dress by Oliver and S\xa0( This is an awesome book to start with your own designs or you don’t want to draft your own pattern. Skirts – self-drafted. Math is everywhere and I try to remind my kids every day. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve looked up how to calculate the radius of a circle. Pants: do you have the\xa0Graphite Trousers pattern by Toya\xa0yet? GET IT – My girl loves the fit. I used the top half and used leggings fit for the bottom part. My fabrics came from\xa0Cali fabrics\xa0who sponsored a big chunk of what I had to purchase, some out of my stash, Joanns and wholesale fabric direct. And now for an overload of pictures to enjoy. Bella is such a nature girl and especially loves to be in it in a twirly dress so the picture taking for this one went extremely smooth. Here you can see how the front seam lines turns inwards towards the neck. Wrinkles is digging her new outfit. I took these pictures on Halloween and I can almost not believe how quickly it has changed and gone brown in 5 days so I am glad it worked out like it did. I have to start out by saying I am ecstatic being here right at this moment. It was perfect timing as my girl is old enough to design with me and young enough where she still absolutely adores me sewing for her. When I get the themes so many things are going through my head and I need at least a week to process (It’s my favorite part) before I do my first cut into fabric. Let’s talk theme – \xa0My girl is both outspoken and love designing. She sees the world through rose-colored glasses. She’s all about the love ( The shirt definitely was going to have a heart) \xa0laugh, color and lots of hugs ( Even if you don’t want them, \xa0it’s like she senses who needs them more) She’s my sunshine child \xa0( hence the bright yellow jacket ) The Process –\xa0The ribbing of the jacket was our color inspiration. When I pulled the ribbing out of a package a while back, she immediately grabbed it and exclaimed ” All my favorite colors all in one” , so we went from there. The Shirt was my first item and my design and then it just flowed. My mom made this amazing satin ribbon pillow when I was just a little girl that she entered into a competition and I can still picture its’ beauty in my head so for the heart I used the colors from the ribbing in fat quarters and weaved them on a white linen heart and did the inlay on the shirt ( it sounds so easy right now 🙂 ) She wanted a shirt type vest so I did just that. In the summer she can wear it as is and in the winter she can either wear a jacket or wear a shirt underneath.\xa0She really wants all the pencil skirts but with her activity level it just isn’t feasible so I went for a denim pleated skirt ( lots of pins and ironing) \xa0It has all the goodness you can possible want from a denim item.- pockets and more pockets, a zipper, topstiching and elastic in the waistband. Well-fitted around the hips with lots of pleats for movement and denim goes with EVERYTHING!\xa0Tip of the day: \xa0buying denim needles and denim thread is worth it. The jacket had to have a zipper so she can pull it on and off for school or dance or crossfit or soccer, it had to bright and fun to match her personality, hoodie to save the buns from the wind and pom poms on leather strings to play with if she’s bored, minty striped pockets to keep her hands warm\xa0(Honestly I want that jacket for me) \xa0The Socks and Wrinkles’ outfit – \xa0Wrinkles is Bella’s best Lovie that she found at a flea market 4 years ago and they are almost always together so I drafted her a little t-shirt with rainbow applique and a matching pleated skirt with a hole in the back where her tail fits through. Dots, hearts and rainbows are popular in Bella’s sketches so we went for gold htv dots on super soft DBP and coral ribbing for the socks. Pictures were taken in Ottawa, Il in front of our favorite painted wall. \xa0I thought the kid playing marbles was very suiting for this challenge. If you’ve never sewn along or maybe you have but stopped, please join – It is so much fun. You will meet amazing people that share your love, hobby, creativeness and will provide an awesome support system. Here is the heart process. It was at night so the pics are not perfect. For the heart the shirt is fully lined in the front so there are no exposed seams. My name is Carin\xa0and\xa0I live in Princeton, Il with my hubby and 2 kids where I am stay-at-home mom as well as wearing many other hats. We moved here a year ago via\xa0 a few states and 3 continents.\xa0 Interesting fact\xa0about me is that I am more African than American. I was born in South Africa and for generations\xa0my family has become very rooted there. \xa0I love that I can be both a South African and American at the same time. My roots and change over years has grown me into the creative person I am today and I am very privileged to be part of this Project Run and Play season. I have been sewing along since 2014 some years more than others but always loving it. My love of Sewing? The phrase “I got it from my Mama” rings very\xa0true here. I grew up in my Mom’s sewing room. She is a self-taught amazing seamstress that went from sewing\xa0for herself, us and many other people into teaching sewing classes out of her garage. I have a B.Sc in Home Economics and even though the art of sewing,designing etc. was a huge part of it, my love and skill comes from my wonderful Mom. Most of my sewing in my early years was just sewing for myself using patterns from fabric shops.\xa0 In College I mostly did\xa0sewing for myself and some formal dresses for some of my dorm mates.\xa0 Then “ adulting “ happened and fast forward 10 years and some,\xa0I started sewing again, just a little in the beginning and when my youngest daughter turned 1, it turned into my full on passion and therapy . There is something so beautiful about creating. \xa0If I am not sewing, I am probably\xa0thinking of what I am going to sew next. Project Run and Play sewalongs played a big role in me getting back to sewing and designing. I loved the idea of “themed” sewing to build\xa0on my own skill as well is building my daughters wardrobe. My style includes lots and lots of color, I love technique and always try to improve on my own. I love old-fashioned sewing\xa0with a modern twist. I view every item I sew as a piece of Art – from the moment I put it together in my head, to picking out fabrics, sewing and\xa0pressing the very last hem. When designing I either use my own block I made with my daughter’s measurements via the Aldridge method but mostly I use patterns from indie pattern designers that I love and who I know encourages flipping their pattern. I hope to use as many of my favorite Indie pattern designers as possible during this season with my own spin. I am very excited about sharing my craft with you and seeing everyone else create.

I tried downloading today’s photos but wasn’t able to do so for several hours. Now at almost 11:00 am, I’m still busy getting the post ready to upload. According to our visiting friends Okey Dokey and family, yesterday, people were being turned away without a pre-paid reservation. And even many of those visitors with “reservations” were left waiting for up to two hours to enter the gate. The extra cost for booking a reservation, over and above the usual entrance fees (prices vary), is ZAR 38 (US $3.07) per person. Once inside, every sighting is observed by dozens of vehicles. Oh, good grief. This enormous natural environment is taken over by commercialism during the holiday, returning to its quiet and enriching status that usually takes one’s breath away. Of course, we aren’t going to the park again until well after the holiday when most tourists have left the area. That’s not to say there aren’t others like us who are renting holiday homes during the quieter seasons who will still be here. Hopefully, they, too, like us, attempt to blend in and become a part of this magical place. As we enter the cooler winter season, beginning on June 21st, tourism in the area will taper off due to lower temperatures. This morning, both of us were outside on the veranda by 6:30 am bundled up to stay warm. Now, four hours later, we’re back to shorts and tee shirts. The cooler weather will not deter us from spending our days and nights outdoors.\xa0 We’ll add more layers of clothing to stay warm. It doesn’t get much below 10C (50F) during most winter months. But, after all of these years of warm weather (except for Antarctica), these temps might feel cold to us. Before dusk, our dear friend, Okey Dokey, our driver here in Marloth Park four years ago, who remained a great friend these past years, visited us with her husband and baby, both named Dani, for snacks, wine, and beer. We’d never met the two Danis and adored them both. n. It was delightful to meet her two loved ones. It was as if we’d never missed a beat. How fortunate we are to have made such fine friends along the w A third Danie, of Louise and Danie, also joined us since they were also good friends with this extraordinary young woman. We were sad to see them go. But, adorable little Danie, now almost eight months old, was ready for sleep after they spent a very long day in Kruger, as they explained above, regarding gaining entrance into the park. Who knows how long it will be until we see them again? They’ve invited us to visit them at the “farm,” a five-hour drive from here. Perhaps, at some point during our remaining months in South Africa (immigration permitting), we’ll visit them. Soon we’re off to the little market at Marlothi Centre for a few items for tonight’s dinner and more carrots and apples for our wildlife friends. It will be a quiet few days for us with no plans to travel any further than the little market,\xa0 as the holiday season continues through Tuesday. Last night, our friends Kathy and Don, joined us for dinner at our bush home. We prepared an excellent meal without too much fuss so we could enjoy sitting on the veranda on a perfect evening, enjoying our lively conversation and the sounds of night in the bush. On Thursday, tourists began arriving in Marloth, with many staying through Tuesday, the end of the five-day holiday weekend. The traffic has been outrageous for this conservancy. The otherwise quiet dirt road we live in is experiencing a steady stream of cars, day and night. Kathy and Don, who live along the Crocodile River, said they’ve also seen a steady flow of traffic on their usually quiet dirt road as well. We’ll all be glad when the holiday ends. No offense intended for tourists. But, the calm and quiet residents hold in high regard is often disturbed during the busy holiday season. When Louise and Danie stopped by for a visit yesterday, they mentioned it felt like more tourists here now than there were at Easter or this past Christmas season. This is a dilemma for people who own homes here. The community needs the revenue generated by tourists staying in holiday homes and spending money in restaurants and shops. The majority of the tourists are thoughtful of the “rules of the park.” still, they can’t help but feel frustrated by a handful of tourists who play loud music, talk loudly, and are inconsiderate of the wildlife and trash disposal. Last night, after we cleaned up (Tom did the many dishes), we wandered back outside to the veranda to see if any visitors would stop by.\xa0 During the busy holiday seasons, few animals visit their usual haunts. We haven’t seen Scar Face, Wart Face, or Frank since Friday, and only a few bushbucks, kudus, and the usual zillions of guinea fowl have made an appearance. This is typical when there are lots of people are in the park. Hopefully, they’ll return to their usual routine by Tuesday or Wednesday, and so will we. In the interim, we’re staying put. Early this morning, we did a load of laundry and hung it on the clothesline. Now, as the sky has turned dark and cloudy, we may have to bring it inside before it rains. Few people have clothes dryers in South Africa, or for that matter, in many parts of the world. Included in our rent is our fantastic Marta, who gladly will do all of our laundry. She washes and hangs up the sheets each week. In the interim, Tom and I don’t mind washing our clothes and hanging them to dry. Since we have so few items and only so much underwear, we do laundry more often than some. By doing it ourselves, we don’t have to wait a day or two until the next laundry day, especially for items we wear frequently. He doesn’t like words on his clothing. I sleep in a Celebrity Cruise Line tee shirt that Tom didn’t want when it had words on it. It’s currently the only warm-weather sleepwear I own. I had a wide variety of attractive sleepwear in varying colors and styles suitable for all weather conditions in our old lives. Not the case now. I wash the one tee shirt in the hopes it will dry by bedtime. If it’s too humid for it to dry (often the case), I’ll “borrow” a different tee shirt from Tom for the one night. He doesn’t mind a bit. There’s one item of clothing I miss… a long fluffy bathrobe. A few holiday homes have had robes, but they’re often intended for much shorter people than the two of us. Wearing a robe that barely covers one’s backside is uncomfortable. We have no room in our luggage for robes, never have, never will. It’s a small and insignificant sacrifice. After all these years, we give little thought to the “stuff” we had in our old lives. Sure, at times, I think that a food processor would be handy. I’m constantly chopping and dicing for our meals, and it would be so much easier with this handy kitchen appliance. In the realm of things, I guess it just isn’t that important. With two more days until the crowd thins out and our wildlife friends return, we’ll busy ourselves with “human” friends such as Okey Dokey and her family coming for happy hour today. Louise and Danie will join us.\xa0 I’d better get back in the kitchen and finish some chopping and dicing for some snacks for this afternoon when our guests arrive. And, I see at the moment a few raindrops are falling. We’d better take the clothes off the line! In actuality, although harsh, witnessing such an event can be a life-changing experience as we mature and grow in our vast appreciation of the animal kingdom worldwide. We’ll never know what happened to him to cause this horrific injury. All we know is we didn’t want to report his injury to the Rangers, who, when they’d see such a devastating injury, may have decided euthanasia was the way to go. We had hope. We didn’t report it. The five-day holiday observation includes today’s Freedom Day (Freedom Day is a public holiday in South Africa celebrated on\xa0April 27th each year. It celebrates freedom and commemorates the first post-apartheid elections held in 1994),\xa0then the May Day celebrations begin. See this link for details. Once again, Marloth Park is packed. All of Louise and Danie’s holiday rentals are booked (not unusual for their exceptional properties. There’s an endless stream of vehicles along our ordinarily quiet dirt road, and the shops and restaurants will be packed over the weekend until Tuesday when the festivities come to an end. With company coming for dinner tomorrow evening (friends Kathy and Don), we plan to stay put over the next several days. We have plenty of food, drinks, and supplies on hand and a plan to make a great dinner not only tomorrow but for the remaining evenings as well. With the post done and uploaded yesterday around noon, we decided to take one more bumpy drive on the dirt roads in Marloth Park to see if we’d discover any unique sightings.\xa0 Whether it’s a turtle or a lizard on the road, a parade of elephants along the river, or a bloat of hippos lounging in a pool of water, it all matters to us. As we drove over one outrageously bumpy road after another, seeing very little, which can be attributed to the increased traffic in the park, we decided to call it a day and head to Daisy’s Den for more birdseed and a few items we needed for the weekend. It’s such fun going to any one of the three small shopping centers here in Marloth Park. Talk about a small-town feel! These are oozing with charm and quaintness, leaving both of us enjoying any necessary shopping runs we may make throughout the week to fill in on any items needed. The pickings are slim in either of the two little grocery stores carrying just the basics. At times, we’re surprised by the excellent produce and odds and ends we may find that prevent us from the necessity of the long drive to Komatipoort for only an item or two. The drive to the Marloth Park shops is three minutes. The purpose to Komatipoort is 20 to 25 minutes, depending on what big trucks we’re stuck behind on the two-lane road. Back at home by 2:00 pm, the moment we stepped out of the little blue car we realized we had visitors…unwanted visitors…a troop of baboons. Luckily, there isn’t much they can destroy on the veranda at this house. Sure, they could ruin the cushions on the outdoor chairs, but the potted plants are simply too heavy to tip over. There are some decorator items on the stucco walls and both a gas grill and wood-burning braai (grill), neither of which seem to appeal to baboons on one of their destructive rants.\xa0 Weeks ago, we knew they’d been here when we found poop, baboon poop, all over the veranda and cushions from a few chairs tossed about.\xa0 We cleaned up the stinky mess and put everything back in order. As we kept a watchful eye on yesterday baboon invasion after closing the doors to the house, we heard several loud crashes coming from next door. Maybe they were heading our way next! Tom grabbed his big stick designated for precisely this type of situation, which if he holds over his head cause the baboons tend to freak out and run away. It worked perfectly. After we were assured they were gone from the general area, Tom walked next door to check out the damage, taking these photos we’ve shown. \xa0If they’d turned over a trash bin, he could set it upright to avoid more baboons and Vervet monkeys coming to eat from the garbage which often occurs. That’s why homeowners have wired or steel cages to hold their trash until pickup arrives. Luckily, they never returned the remainder of the day. We spent the evening as usual, on the veranda enjoying our dinner and watching a variety of “friends” come and go. Tomorrow, we’ll share the heartfelt story of an injured animal we’ve come to know and love and how we’ve attempted\xa0to help him\xa0a little as he hopefully recovers soon. We’ll be sharing some hard-to-look-at photos of his awful injury and why some animals in the park are treated by volunteer vets and others are not or in some cases euthanized by shooting. Please stop back for this story. We’ve had few quiet mornings in Marloth Park since we arrived two and a half months ago. Whether it’s the four dozen helmeted guinea fowl that live in the bush surrounding our house, a single kudu or a forkl of kudu, a sounder of warthogs or Frank (the francolin) and his wife, it’s always a busy morning. Often, they begin to appear once we’re up and about, but on a rare occasion, as soon as we open the giant wooden doors to the house, a variety may be awaiting us. “What’s for breakfast,” their eyes ask as they stare at us. Wildlife in Marloth Park is used to being fed. A part of this outrageous adventure are the sounds in the bush both day and night, including an indescribable variety of bird calls, cricket chirps, impala barks, hog snorts, frogs croaks (only the males’ croak), and the frequent sounds at a distance, often hard for us novices to decipher. In time we will learn. For now, we sit back in a perpetual state of wonder, rarely ever missing a beat. The rustling in the bush is often a good indicator that an animal is approaching. My finely-tuned hearing is quick to pick up on a pending arrival, for which I quietly alert Tom while we both wait in anticipation as to who will grace our presence in the next minute or two. With Tom’s years of\xa0hearing\xa0loss from “working on the railroad,” with difficulty hearing certain tones, he’s often dependent on me to let him know someone is approaching.\xa0 But, then, his keen eye often spots action in the bush long before I see it. We’re a good team as observers of wildlife in the bush (along with other things). As wildlife populations diminish worldwide due to human intervention and a natural cycle of life, death, and extinction, we’ve added the experience of seeing and being entrenched in the beauty of nature and wildlife, which our great-grandchildren may never be able to see. Perhaps our stories and photos here will provide them with a peek into “what it was like” decades ago to help them have a better understanding of cyclic changes in nature precipitated by myriad forces often beyond our control. Did “humankind” wipe out the dinosaurs? No. Nature did.\xa0 And maybe, just maybe, nature naturally has played such a role over the millennium. Once, humans weren’t on this earth. Will one day we be gone as well? We don’t know, nor can we accurately surmise or assume we can change what is yet to come in our destiny. Meanwhile, many of us are allowed to play a role, however small and seemingly insignificant in the realm of things, that may or may not impact the future. If doing so brings us peace and purpose, then the effort and dedication were valuable and meaningful. Some may say, everything we do is for our pleasure. And, we’d be foolhardy to deny that reality. But, if somehow, through our daily stories and photos, we can provide a moment of pleasure to others throughout the world who may be reading our posts, then this daily commitment was all worthwhile. For this, dear readers, we glean our greatest joy.\xa0 For this, dear readers, we thank all of YOU. Once the temporary filling was in place, I didn’t give it another thought until it fell out during dinner while on the cruise. Since there was no pain or discomfort, just a gaping hole in the tooth, I’d figured that in time I’d get it repaired. Oh, good grief. I don’t like medical stuff. But, if we still lived in the US, from time to time, we’d go to a dentist, a doctor, an ophthalmologist, or others for a wide variety of aches, pains, and illnesses that occur to us at any age. No one is exempt from these issues. Unfortunately, living outside our home country and unsure of the quality of medical care in many countries, taking care of medical issues is fraught with a certain degree of fear and apprehension. Are things sterile?\xa0 Will we “catch” something in the doctor’s office? Is the doctor educated sufficiently to handle our concerns, or do they do “cookie-cutter” treatment for all their patients? One never knows. As we’ve worked with Dr. Theo Stronkhorst in Komatipoort for our vaccination boosters and my gastro issues, we’ve felt confident in his care. His knowledge and attention to detail are impeccable. She gently repaired the filling without anesthetic (to which I jumped only a few times), and we were off to the grocery store, meat market, and biltong store for the foodstuffs we need over the next week. Another holiday is on the horizon, and once again, Marloth Park will be packed with tourists. We won’t be returning to Kruger until the holiday is over after the weekend. We hear it’s the “May Day” holiday which wasn’t mainly celebrated in the US in our old lives.\xa0 Instead, we celebrated “Labor Day” on the first Monday in September. By 3:00 pm, we were back home, put away all the groceries, and settled in on the veranda to a busy night in the bush. We used the gas grill to make pork chops for Tom and lamb for me, along with bacony green beans and homemade low-carb almond flour muffins, a real treat when warmed and topped with butter. Several times during dinner, we had to jump up to accommodate visitors. But, we don’t mind. A cold plate of food is just fine as long as we can spend time with the animals who stop by day and night, always making us smile. Although midday may not be the perfect time to find wildlife out and about in the heat of the sun, we decided “why not?”\xa0 We’d never entered the park this late in the day but it wasn’t as if we had any other pressing matters on the agenda…the wildlife “at home” could wait for our return if they happened to stop by and we weren’t around. Since we were both showered and dressed for the day it took us only a few minutes to get ready to head out the door; gather our passports, park entrance documents, camera and extra batteries, binoculars, and drinks in our mugs (water for me and iced tea for Tom). By noon, we were out the door to head to the petrol station to put air in the little blue car’s tires.\xa0 We have to do this every few days but refuse to pay for tire repairs on the rental car, especially since we’ll only have it for another 17\xa0days. Hopefully, the vehicle we’ve rented for the next three more months, which we’ll pick up in Nelspruit after we return from Zambia on May 18th, won’t have similar problems as the past few rentals in South Africa. Once we crossed the Crocodile Bridge and reached the entrance to the park, when we showed our Wild Card (annual pass to the park) we were told we’d have to go inside in order to be allowed to enter the park. Any visitors arriving after\xa012:00 pm have to register inside the reception building.\xa0 Little did we know it would take 15 minutes to have a rep at the desk check us in.\xa0 Next time, we’ll make sure to arrive before noon to avoid this added wait. By 12:45 we were on the main paved road with a plan to drive for an hour or more and then turn around and head back the same way.\xa0 With the car’s bad tires, we weren’t about to tackle a washboard dirt road. Today, we’re off to Komatipoort for a dentist appointment for me.\xa0 A filling I had repaired in Costa Rica has fallen out and needs to be\xa0repaired.\xa0 I don’t like going to a dentist but\xa0who does?\xa0 It’s just a fact of life we all must bear.\xa0 Our friend Gail made a recommendation for a good dentist located two doors from Wimpy’s Hamburgers\xa0near the Spar Supermarket.\xa0\xa0Afterward, we’ll do some grocery shopping. The activity we’ve had in the yard in the past 24 hours has been astounding, especially at dusk last night and again early this morning. I was running back and forth from the kitchen to the veranda with cut-up carrots and apples while Tom kept refilling the yellow plastic container with pellets. Currently, we’re totally out of carrots and soon will run out of apples. Fortunately, the cost of both of these is minimal. A five-kilo bag (11 pounds) of carrots is ZAR 29 (US $2.37), and it’s about the same for the big bags of small red apples. Usually, the bags of carrots and apples will last a week if we’re a little discriminating in handing them out. The cost for the bags of pellets, which last almost a week, is ZAR 199 (US $17.03). As a result, we’re spending US $22.77 per week plus a small number of eggs for the mongoose, which only come by every two or three days. At the most, we’re spending ZAR 307 (US $25) per week. Since we seldom spend very little on ourselves, we justify this expenditure out of our pure love of the wildlife and the pleasure of providing them with nourishment. In our old lives, I would have spent ZAR 307 (US $25) to go out to lunch with the girls one day a week by ordering a Cobb Salad, an iced tea, and paying tax and tip. Regardless of the cost to feed the animals I post here for our curious readers, we are having the time of our lives. The only challenge we feel at this time is my healing from this dreadful gastrointestinal condition. I’ve been on the H2 blockers for one week as of today and have noticed only a slight improvement. We shall see how it goes since they’re supposed to provide an improvement over a period of time, not necessarily after only one week of treatment. Last night as we dined on the veranda, we could hardly finish the food on our plates. It seemed that we had one visitor after another every few minutes, each with their own plan in mind as to what they wanted. Was it apples, pellets, carrots, or seeds? Overall, we must admit the wildlife prefer the pellets over the fruit and veg. However, they seem to particularly enjoy scraps from vegetables we’re cooking, especially the outside leaves from celery, lettuce, and cabbage. As darkness falls each night, the sounds in the bush are music to our ears. Even Tom, with his not-so-good hearing after 42½ years working on the railroad, can hear most of the sounds. If only we had the knowledge and expertise to identify each sound. But, as time goes by, we’re learning to recognize more and more sounds, including our newly discovered recognition of the “bark” of the impalas as they run through the bush day and night, as they challenge one another for mating rites. Until recently, we never knew or recognized this sound. Now, as we spend more and more time with warthogs, kudus, and a variety of wildlife in the antelope family, we’ve come to understand their grunts and sounds, each with a special meaning and specific tones. What a wonder it is to be a part of this magical world. Last night, as we lounged outdoors after dinner, Tom asked, “Will you ever get tired of this?” “No, I won’t,” I answered, “it’s not even possible. ” He agreed. Would one get tired of eating a delicious meal, hearing beautiful music, seeing gorgeous scenery? Would one tire of the touch of a hand, a kindly spoken word, or the wagging tail of their beloved dog? Hardly. And that’s the way it is here. There’s no getting tired of it, not for us anyway. When we see homes for sale in Marloth Park, we often wonder what precipitated a homeowner’s desire to leave after spending time here. No, we have no interest in owning a house, here or anywhere in the world, but we now know from the bottom of our hearts that this won’t be the last time we’ll visit Africa, health providing, as we continue on our world journey. Maybe in two or three years, but we’ll be back…not for so long next time but three months for sure. In a few days, we’ll be heading back to Kruger National Park, and in 18 days, we’ll be flying to Livingstone, Zambia. Humm…life is good. May your life be good as well. Yes, we know…it appears many of the photos we post are repetitious. How could they not be? We’re living in the African bush surrounded by wildlife. However, we make a point of not sharing repeats of the same photos. The way we manage this is by placing the day’s photos in the “Today’s Photos” folder on my desktop. Once we post those photos, we move them to the general “Marloth Park” or another appropriately named file.\xa0 This keeps us from using the same photo over and over again, but we may post a similar photo over time. Then, for the next day, we review recently taken photos we’ve yet to post taken from another named folder.\xa0 Keeping track of all of this is relatively easy but does require a considerable amount of time each day. At times, we are concerned we may be losing readers when we’re posting one animal photo after another, day after day. We’re hoping that our readers will remain with us during the remaining months in Africa even with these ongoing wildlife photos. If nothing else,\xa0we hope you’ll\xa0check back from time to time to see what’s new as was the case in yesterday’s post when we described a fabulous trip we’ll be taking to Kenya in 10 months, an exciting tour of “bucket list” venues we only imagined in our dreams. If you missed yesterday’s post with the detailed itinerary, please click here for the exciting details. This tour will be a “photographic” expedition which hopefully gives us both an opportunity to hone our photo-taking skills which we both need. I’m particularly at an impasse in the\xa0learning process and look forward to working with Greg Harvey, who’s organized the expedition and will be on-site during the entire adventure. Two weeks earlier on April 7th, we posted the information about our upcoming trip to Zambia, required to ensure we can get our passports stamped for another 90 days in South Africa and part of our plan as to what we wanted to see while we are in Africa for this extended period…in this case Victoria Falls and more. If you missed that post, please click here for the details. Once we return from that trip on May 18th, we’ll begin a new search for a location for the next visa renewal due another 90 days later which will take us into August and from there, another trip taking us well into November. That will leave us with a final 90 days between the time we return from our plans for November until it’s time to leave South Africa to head to Kenya for the final African adventure. Researching, booking, and presenting stories and photos from all of these many events will provide us with plenty of fodder for continuing stories over the next many months. In the interim, until our upcoming adventure begins on May 11th (in 19 days),\xa0we’ll continue to search for new topics to share along with the day-to-day we so much love; stories about people, wildlife, local venues, and on and on. Writing a new story with photos on a daily basis is a daunting undertaking. As we’ve mentioned many times in the past, at this point, we have no intention of changing how and how often we do this. We equate this process to writing a newspaper story each and every day. However, in those cases, the news is happening all around the reporters to provide fodder for stories.\xa0 or us, our stories are predicated on what is happening in the lives of us, two senior world travelers. It’s not always exciting and newsworthy. Who’s daily life is anyway? There’s always the plain, the mundane, and the predictable. We kindly ask all of our loyal readers to stay with us through these many months in Africa and if possible, to forward our link to family and friends who may be curious to read about our peculiar lives and to see our endless photos. We so much appreciate all the wonderful email messages we receive from many of our readers each day and we’ll continue to make every effort to respond to each and every one of those messages within 24 hours. We also encourage you to post comments at the end of each post. You can do so anonymously if you so choose and here again, we’ll always respond with 24 hours. Due to yesterday’s power outage, we couldn’t upload yesterday’s post dated April 20, 2018, until this morning.\xa0 Sorry for the inconvenience.\xa0 Also, none of today’s photos are ours except for “Sighting of the Day in the Bush.” Last week when\xa0Louise sent me this safari/tour event in Messenger on Facebook, I gave it a severe look, noticing that several aspects of it\xa0make my heart skip a beat about the prospect of returning to Kenya. The thought of returning to the Masai Mara, the most highly regarded and wildlife-rich game reserve in the world, stirred my memories from our visit in 2013, one of the most incredible experiences of our world travels. Next,\xa0the\xa0prospect of\xa0visiting Giraffe Manor, which I’d heard a lot about, sent me into a tailspin of excitement. Also, adding the concept of touring the world-renowned David\xa0Sheldrick\xa0Wildlife Trust, which has been of dream of mine since we first visited Africa, made my heart skip a beat.\xa0 (Daphne Sheldrick, David’s wife, was the world’s most renowned elephant rescuer, passed away last Thursday at age 83. Click here for details). Then,\xa0the idea of a\xa0stay at Little Governor’s Camp after I’d watched this video many times, dreaming of having such a once-in-a-lifetime\xa0experience, sent me to the moon with sheer delight. How could such a package be presented by any other than well-known Canadian wildlife photographer and “tour\xa0designer\xa0extraordinaire,”\xa0Greg Harvey of Harvey Wildlife Photography?\xa0 His exceptional passion for wildlife coupled with the finest of skills and experience made this event particularly appealing. This was not going to be a standard safari, but as Greg calls it, “a bucket list” experience few seldom add to their repertoire of wildlife adventures. Instead, the February 22 to March 7, 2019, the event can round out our African experiences beyond our “wildest” dreams before we leave the continent (after 13 months) on March 7, 2019, the day of our wedding anniversary. We’d intended to stay in South Africa until around March 21, 2019, but since we’re embarking on this tour, we’ll be leaving one month earlier than planned. Luckily, our schedule has some flexibility to make changes at this point. No doubt, this is a pricey expedition, mainly when it includes only 14 guests. It certainly isn’t as expensive as Antarctica was but higher than our preferred price range for tours and cruises at ZAR 87,149 per person for a total of ZAR 174298 (US $7200 per person for a total of US $14,400). Not only does this expedition offer such exciting venues, but it will also give us both the opportunity to hone our photographic skills. For these very types of opportunities, we remain frugal in our daily lives of world travel; low rents when possible, inexpensive rental cars; less dining out than most travelers; and minimal purchases besides groceries and essentials. Even with this extra expenditure, we’ll be able to stay within our budget. After many email communications with Greg Harvey, we firmed up our reservation, paid the deposit (the balance paid in two installments between now and then), and we’re set to go. We have yet to arrange the long flight to Nairobi, Kenya from South Africa, which previously the reverse had been one of the longest travel days in the past 5½ years, and the flight when we leave Kenya. “Masai Mara, Kenya Safari – February 22-March 7, 2019. In February 2019, Greg from HW Photo & Safaris took another group of safari guests to Kenya. We call it the “Bucket List African Safari Adventure.” Whether it be having breakfast with Rothschild giraffes at Giraffe Manor, watching elephants walk by your tent, or floating 60 feet above the Mara River in a hot air balloon (hot air balloon rides are optional and an extra cost), all of these activities are indeed “bucket list” events. February 22 & 23- Ololo Safari Lodge. Ololo Safari Lodge is located on 20 acres on the south edge of Nairobi National Park. Only half an hour after we leave the airport, we will already be in Nairobi National Park on the way to the lodge. There we will recover from the international travel. For the early risers, the next morning, we will have the opportunity to go on our first official game drive in the park. This will give us the chance to scrape the rust off our photography skills. Zebra Plains is located in great leopard and cheetah territory. As the name suggests, the area is very densely populated with massive herds of zebras. Little Governors’ Camp- Little Governors’ Camp is located in the Northern area of the Masai Mara National Reserve. The site is home to the famous Marsh Pride of lions. This area also has vast numbers of elephants. It is common to see between 100-500 elephants in the Marsh area just a few minutes away from camp. After our private tour of the elephant sanctuary, we will return to the Giraffe Manor for high tea, where we will have the chance to interact with the giraffes. Dinner is at 8 p.m. jessicablyman@gmail.com thomasllyman@gmail.com', '']","Freedom Day is a South African public holiday (its national day), celebrated on 27 April.

reactions in which electrons are transferred between atoms is called,"['', '', 'Please try again in 30 seconds.', 'The Calvin cycle is an important and complicated series of biochemical reactions that take place in photosynthetic organisms and results in the fixing of carbon from carbon dioxide into organic molecules. One of the light-independent (dark) reactions used for carbon fixation, this metabolic pathway uses the energy stored in ATP and uses NADPH as a source of electrons (reduction potential), both provided during light-dependent reactions, to reduce carbon dioxide and fix it into the higher energy organic molecules. It is a ""cycle"" in that some of the product is recycled. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of chloroplasts. It also is known as the Calvin–Benson-Bassham cycle (CBB cycle), reductive pentose phosphate cycle, or C3 cycle. Redox reactions. The Calvin cycle, and the associated process known as photosynthesis, involve what are known as ""redox reactions"" or ""oxidation-reduction reactions."" Oxidation occurs when an atom or molecule loses an electron (with oxygen being the most common electron acceptor). Reduction occurs when an atom or molecule gains an electron. A reduced molecule or atom, with the extra electron, has a higher level of energy than an oxidized form of the atom or molecule. A redox reaction is a chemical reaction where electrons lost by one atom through oxidation are gained by another atom through reduction. Photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis is the source of the carbon found in the organic compounds within the bodies of living organisms, as well as a means for capturing the energy from sunlight. Some of the light energy is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and some of the energy is used to remove electrons from a substance such as water, with the electrons then used in the reactions to turn carbon dioxide into organic compounds. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, these reactions to produce organic compounds comprise the metabolic pathway known as the Calvin cycle. The overall process of photosynthesis can be described in terms of three stages: two-light dependent reactions and one light-independent reaction. The two light-dependent reactions are (1) capturing energy from sunlight; and (2) creating ATP and reducing NADP+ to NADPH. The light-independent reaction, which can take place in the presence or absence of light and is known as ""carbon fixation,"" involves utilizing ATP and NADPH to synthesize organic molecules from carbon dioxide. Carbon fixation is part of the Calvin cycle. Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle is a series of biochemical redox reactions that take place in the stroma of chloroplasts in photosynthetic organisms. Essentially, the light-independent Calvin cycle, also known (erroneously) as the ""dark reaction"" or ""dark stage,"" uses the energy from short-lived electronically excited carriers to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds (Campbell et al. 2006). It also can be described in terms of three phases: (1) carbon fixation, (2) reduction, and (3) regeneration of RuBP. Phase I: Carbon fixation. In the carbon fixation phase of the Calvin cycle, inorganic carbon in the form of carbon dioxide becomes incorporated into organic form. Essentially, carbon dioxide is reduced to provide a higher energy molecule. During this phase, a five-carbon, energy-rich sugar RuBP (ribulose 1,5-biphosphate) is produced. It is produced by reassembling two products of glycolysis: fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). After RuBP is produced, carbon dioxide reacts with RuBP to form a transient 6-carbon intermediate. This 6-carbon intermediate immediately splits into two molecules of three carbon 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA). It uses the enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (called RuBisCo), which is a large 16-subunit enzyme. Phase II: Reduction. In the second phase, reduction, PGA is reduced to G3P (glyceraldehye 3-phosphate) using ATP and NADPH. Some G3P (which has three carbons) leaves the Calvin cycle and is converted to glucose and other sugars. Note: two molecules of G3P (the output of carbon fixation and reduction) is needed to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule. Phase III: Regeneration. While some G3P is shunted out of the Calvin cycle to produce glucose and other sugars, much of it is recycled in order to regenerate RuBP, to keep the cycle going. The enzymes in the Calvin cycle are functionally equivalent to many enzymes used in other metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway, but they are to be found in the chloroplast stroma instead of the cell cytoplasm, separating the reactions. They are activated in the light (which is why the name ""dark reaction"" is misleading), and also by products of the light-dependent reaction. These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide. Energy (in the form of ATP) would be wasted in carrying out these reactions that have no net productivity. Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are not a product of the Calvin cycle. Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as C6H12O6, this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration, where six-carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or ""triose phosphates,"" namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). The Calvin cycle was discovered by Melvin Calvin, James Bassham, and Andrew Benson at the University of California, Berkeley by using the radioactive isotope carbon-14 (Bassham et al. 1950). Thus, of 6 G3P produced, three RuBP (5C) are made, totaling 15 carbons, with only one available for subsequent conversion to hexose. This required 9 ATPs and 6 NADPH per 3 CO2. Photorespiration. RuBisCO (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase) not only catalyzes the carbon fixation reaction whereby CO2 reacts with RuBP (ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate) to ultimately yield two molecules of PGA (3-phosphoglycerate), but it also catalyzes the oxidation of RuBP, whereby oxygen is incorporated into RuBP, releasing CO2 and hindering carbon fixation. This is known as photorespiration. In other words, in photorespiration, RuBisCO reacts competitively with O2 instead of CO2. The rate of photorespiration is higher at high temperatures. Photorespiration turns RuBP into 3PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate, a 2-carbon molecule that can be converted via glycolate and glyoxalate to glycine. Via the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate, two glycines are converted into serine +CO2. Serine can be converted back to 3-phosphoglycerate. Thus, only 3 of 4 carbons from two phosphoglycolates can be converted back to 3PGA. It can be seen that photorespiration has very negative consequences for the plant, because, rather than fixing CO2, this process leads to loss of CO2. C4 carbon fixation evolved to circumvent photorespiration, but can occur only in certain plants native to very warm or tropical climates, for example, corn. The immediate products of one turn of the Calvin cycle are 2 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) molecules, 3 ADP, and 2 NADP+ (ADP and NADP+ are regenerated in the Light-dependent reactions). Each G3P molecule is composed of 3 carbons. In order for the Calvin cycle to continue, RuBP (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) must be regenerated. So, 5/6 carbon from the 2 G3P molecules are used for this purpose. Therefore, there is only 1 net carbon produced to play with for each turn. To create 1 surplus, G3P requires 3 carbons, and therefore 3 turns of the Calvin cycle. To make one glucose molecule (which can be created from 2 G3P molecules) would require 6 turns of the Calvin cycle. Surplus G3P can also be used to form other carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose, and cellulose, depending on what the plant needs (Russell et al. 2010). As an example (Raven et al. 2008): In the Calvin cycle for the above, 18 ATP are also used and 12 NADPH. Note: Some restrictions may apply to use of individual images which are separately licensed.', '', ""In the Cameroonian traditional medicine, plants of the Capparidaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Liliaceae families are used to treat several metabolic diseases. These plants are rich in various compounds belonging to the glucosinolates and thiosulfinates family. Till date, very little studies have been done aiming at assessing the antioxidant and inflammatory properties of the essential oils (EOs) of these plants. Essential oils are volatile extracts produced by secondary metabolism. They are usually constituted of terpens and may also contain specific non terpenic components such as glucosinolates and thiosulfinates for the species that are being considered in the present study. This study highlights and compares the chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the essential oils of the stem barks of Drypetes gossweileri (Euphorbiaceae), roots of Pentadiplandra brazzeana (Capparidaceae), red bulbs of Allium cepa and Alium sativum (Liliaceae) collected in Cameroon (Central Africa). The essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In vitro antioxidant activities were determined using the radical scavenging assay, total phenolic content, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and determination of antioxidant activity index (AAI) according to the method described by Scherer and Godoy. The anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated using albumin denaturation method. Differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) between the experimental and the control groups were evaluated using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. The main components of Allium sativum essential oil were diallyl trisulfide (41.62\xa0%), diallyl disulfide (19.74\xa0%), allyl methyl trisulfide (12.95\xa0%), diallyl sulfide (7.1\xa0%) and diallyl tetrasulfide (4.22\xa0%). Those of Allium cepa essential oil were diallyl trisulfide (22.17\xa0%), dipropyl trisulfide (11.11\xa0%), 2-methyl-3,4-dithiaheptane (9.88\xa0%), methyl propyl trisulfide (8.14\xa0%), dipropyl tetrasulfide (8.07\xa0%) and 2-propenyl propyl disulfide (5.15\xa0%). Drypetes gossweileri and Pentadiplandra brazzeana essential oils presented similar chemical compositions as compared with benzylisothiocyanate content (63.19 and 97.63\xa0% respectively), but differed in benzylcyanide content (35.72 and 0.86\xa0% respectively). The essential oils were rich in phenolic compounds in the following order Allium sativum\u2009<\u2009Allium cepa\u2009<\u2009D. gossweileiri\u2009<\u2009P. brazzeana. The essential oils exhibited high antioxidant and DPPH radical scavenging effect but low ferric reducing power activity. Moreover, the four essential oils showed anti-inflammatory activities (by heat denaturation of Bovine Serum Albumin). The anti-inflammatory activities of P. brazzeana and A. cepa essential oils were comparable but higher than those of D. gossweileri and sodium diclofenac used as a reference non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The essential oils of the plants were rich in organosulfur compounds. These compounds were probably responsible for their appreciable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, the essential oils of some of these plants might be used as natural additives in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and agro-industries. Allium species, especially Allium vegetables are characterized by their high content in thiosulfinates (TNs). The TNs or alkane (ene) thial-S-oxide are formed by the action of the enzyme alliinase (E.C.4.4.1.4) from their respective S-alk (en) yl cysteine sulfoxides. However, depending on the Allium species and the environmental conditions, the TNs formed are degraded to various polysulfides including diallyl, methyl allyl, and diethyl mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasulfides, vinyldithiins, (E)- and (Z)-ajoene [1]. The organosulfur compounds in Allium are water-soluble (S-allylcysteine and S-allylmercaptocysteine) and lipid-soluble compounds (alliin, diallyl sulfide, triallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl polysulfides) [2, 3]. TNs exhibit different degrees of antimicrobial activity and are found to be effective antioxidants in terms of scavenging [1]. In damaged plant cells, notably those of Capparidaceae and Euphorbiaceae families, glucosinolates (GLs) are transformed by the endogenous myrosinase (EC 3.2.1.147) to produce a number of compounds depending on the precursor glucosinolate and the environmental conditions [4]. GLs form a variety of hydrolysis products including isothiocyanates, oxazolidine-2-thiones, nitriles, epithionitriles, and thiocyanates [5]. Certain GLs (sulforaphane and other isothiocyanates) are well known for their diverse biological activities ranging from bactericidal, nematocidal, fungicidal, insecticidal, antioxidant, antimutagenic, antiproliferative and allelophatic properties [6, 7]. Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the transfer of an electron from electron rich to electron deficient entity. The electron deficient molecule is termed an oxidizing agent [8]. An antioxidant is a substance capable of preventing or slowing the oxidation of other molecules. Substances which protect biomolecules from free radical-mediated damage both in vitro and in vivo fall under this category. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are generated during irradiation by UV light, X and γ rays, products of metal-catalyzed reactions, which are present as pollutants in the atmosphere, produced by neutrophils and macrophages during inflammation process, by-products of mitochondria-catalyzed electron transport reactions and other mechanisms [9]. ROS at higher concentration (termed oxidative stress) are important mediators of cell structure damages including lipids, membranes, proteins and nucleic acids [10]. The harmful effects of ROS are balanced by the antioxidant action of non-enzymatic antioxidants in addition to antioxidant enzymes [11]. Thus, ROS are important mediators that provoke or sustain inflammatory process and consequently, their neutralization by antioxidants and free radical scavengers can attenuate inflammation [12, 13]. Both inflammation and free radical damage are inter-related aspects that influence each other. Inflammation is a protective and defense mechanism of the body to a physical, chemical or biological agression. It is important when it does not last for long. Its main purpose is to destroy the injurious agent and/or minimize its harmful effect by limiting its propagation [14]. Inflammatory response occurs in two distinct phases: an acute and a chronic. The acute phase is characterized by local vasodilatation, increased capillary permeability and release of inflammatory mediators like histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins. The Chronic phase is characterized by infiltration of leukocytes and phagocytic cells [15]. This results in tissue degeneration and fibrosis. In the market, most of the available conventional drugs to relieve oxidative stress and to treat inflammatory-related diseases are either steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory chemicals. Though these drugs are potent enough, long-term administration is required for treatment of chronic diseases. Furthermore, these drugs might lead to severe side effects such as gastric intolerance, bone marrow depression, water and salt retention due to prolonged use [16]. It is in this light that natural remedies with very little side effects, proven efficacy and safety are sought for as substitutes for chemical therapies. Therefore, sulfur-containing plants selected for this study were chosen by virtue of their use in traditional medicine in West Cameroon in the treatment of several inflammatory skin disorders and inflammatory-related diseases. Allium sativum L. and Allium cepa L. (Liliaceae) commonly known as garlic and onion respectively are bulbous herbs used as food item, spice and medicine in different parts of the world.Allium sativum can also be used in homemade cosmetics. It has been employed for its diverse biological activities including anti-carcinogenic, antiatherosclerotic, antithrombotic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [17–21]. The major beneficial effects of Alliums are ascribed to the high content in organosulfur compounds produced when Allium sativum or Allium cepa tissue is damaged and the odorless precursors are converted by the alliinase enzyme and lachrymatory-factor synthase [22, 23]. The most important sulfur-containing compound in Allium cepa bulbs is the amino acid cysteine and its derivatives. A. cepa also contains high levels of flavonoids mainly quercetin as well as other phenolic compounds [24]. In contrast to Allium cepa, Allium sativum mainly contains allicin derivatives such as ajoene, vinyldithiins, and alkenyl-sulphides such as diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide depending on the type of solvent used for the extraction [22, 25]. Drypetes gossweileri is a dioic plant of the Euphorbiaceae family with an average size of about 30 to 40\xa0m. The color of the stem bark turns from grey-green to yellowish-green and it gives a strong characteristic odor when cut [26]. It has been used in traditional medicine for treating fever, malaria, intestinal worms in Central Africa [27, 28]. Phytochemical studies conducted by Ngouana et al. [29] revealed the presence of metabolites such as alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, saponines, anthraquinones, tannins, anthocyanins, sterols, lipids and essential oils. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts from previous studies indicated the presence of steroids, triterpenoids, alkaloids, saponins with antimicrobicidal properties [30]. Many research works describe the antibacterial [31, 32], antifungal [29, 33], antioxidant and antiradical [32, 34] effects of D. gossweileri. It is is also used in pest management [35]. Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baill (Capparidaceae) is a climber found in Western and Central Africa [36], the berries of which are eaten and used as a sweetener of beverages [37]. Root, seed, and leaf extracts of P. brazzeana are known to contain benzyl-, 3-methoxybenzyl-, 4methoxybenzyl-, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl-, and indole-type glucosinolates [38]; and the essential oil obtained from its roots is mainly constituted of benzylisothiocyanate and benzylcyanide [32, 39–41]. Its root essential oil (EO) has been proven to possess free-radical scavenging [32, 40, 42], antibacterial [32, 42], antifungal [41, 42] and anti-inflammatory activities [42]. In previous studies, the aqueous extract of P. brazzeana root was shown to possess androgenic activity [43]. Moreover, the crude extract of P. brazzeana root as well as the compounds isolated from it (thiourea and urea) exhibited a moderately strong antiplasmodial activity against two Plasmodium falciparum strains [44]. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of some Allium species grown in other countries have been analyzed, but no information is available on the in vitro antioxidant activities of red bulb A. cepa and red bulb A. sativum species growing in Cameroon. Antioxidant activities have already been studied using the DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging method and the β-carotene bleaching test [40, 42], but a different method is used here to confirm it. In addition, anti-inflammatory activity has not yet been reported for D. gossweileri stem barks. Moreover, considering that antioxidants and free radical scavengers can also exert an anti-inflammatory effect [13], the essential oil of D. gossweileri stem barks were also assessed for these activities in comparison with that obtained from A. cepa and A. sativum, two plants well-known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of the aforementioned sulfur-containing plants in order to confirm their efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory disorders as claimed in Cameroonian ethnomedicine. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and aluminum chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Ascorbic acid and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (China). All other reagents and solvents were of analytical grade. A. sativum red bulbs, A. cepa red bulbs, D. gossweileri stem barks and P. brazzeana roots were purchased in Yaounde (Mokolo and Mfoundi markets) in August 2013. A. sativum red bulbs and A. cepa red bulbs were harvested at Garoua (North Region of Cameroon). D. gossweileri stem barks and P. brazzeana roots were harvested at Hawae and Ngomedzap (Center Region of Cameroon) respectively by the vendors. Identification was done at the National Herbarium of Cameroon by comparison with voucher specimens 25742/SRF/Cam, 44810/HNC, 25749/SRF/Cam and 42918/SRF/Cam for A. cepa, A. sativum, D. gossweileri and P. brazzeana respectively. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 5\xa0h, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then stored at 4\xa0°C until bioassay. The extraction yields were calculated as the ratio of the mass of EO to the mass of the starting plant material and expressed as a percentage (w/w). The EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry as described by Agnaniet et al. [45]. GC analysis was performed on a Varian gas chromatograph, model CP-3380, with flame ionization detector containing two silica capillary columns: HP5 J&W Agilent (5\xa0%-Phenyl-methylpolysiloxane) capillary column (30\xa0m × 0.25\xa0mm i.d. × 0.25\xa0μm film) and Supelcowax 10 (polyethylene glycol) fused capillary column (30\xa0m × 0.25\xa0mm i.d. × 0.25\xa0μm film); N2 was the carrier gas at 0.8\xa0mL/min; injection type 0.1\xa0μL of pure sample, split ratio 1:100; injector temperature 220\xa0°C, detector temperature 250\xa0°C; temperature program 50-200\xa0°C at 5\xa0°C/min, then kept at 200\xa0°C for 10\xa0min. The linear retention indices of the components were determined relative to the retention times of a series of n-alkanes. The entire set up was coordinated by COMPASS software system that ensured its functioning and follow-up of the chromatographic analysis. GC-MS analyses were performed using a Hewlett-Packard GC 5890 series II equipped with a HP5 (5\xa0%-Phenylmethylpolysiloxane) fused silica column (30\xa0m × 0.25\xa0mm; film thickness 0.25\xa0μm) and a DB-Wax fused silica column (30\xa0m × 0.25\xa0mm; film thickness 0.25\xa0μm) interfaced with a quadrupole detector (Model 5972); temperature program (50–200\xa0°C at 5\xa0°C/min); injector temperature, 220\xa0°C; MS transfer line temperature, 180\xa0°C; carrier gas, helium at a flow rate of 0.6\xa0mL/min; injection type, split, 1:10 (1\xa0μL 10:100 CH2Cl2 solution); ionization voltage, 70\xa0eV; electron multiplier 1460\xa0eV; scan range, 35–300\xa0amu; scan rate, 2.96 scan/s. The identification of the constituents was based on comparison of their relative retention times with either those of authentic samples or with published data in the literature [46] and matching their mass spectra with those obtained from authentic samples and/or the NBS75K and Wiley 7th NIST 98 EPA/NIH libraries spectra and literature data [46]. The percentage composition of the essential oils was computed by the normalization method from the GC-FID peak areas, assuming an identical mass response factor for all compounds. In order to determine the radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of the EOs, the following assays were applied: total phenolic content determination, FRAP assay and DPPH assay. The phenolic content in EOs was determined according to the method described by Singleton et al. [47] with slightly modifications. In effect, 10\xa0μg/mL of EOs were used in the analysis. The reaction mixtures were prepared by mixing 60\xa0μL of EO, 2\xa0mL of 10\xa0% Folin-Ciocalteu dissolved in water. For the blank, 60\xa0μL of methanol, 2\xa0mL of 10\xa0% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were mixed in water. After 30\xa0min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 750\xa0nm using a V-1100 spectrophotometer. Ascorbic acid was used as standard. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The total phenolic content was expressed in μg ascorbic acid equivalent per mg of EO (μg AAE/mg) using the following equation based on the calibration curve: The reducing power of the EOs was determined in accordance with the method reported by Zhao et al. [48] with slight modifications. 1\xa0mL of each EO was mixed with 2.5\xa0mL of 0.2\xa0M phosphate buffer (pH\u2009=\u20096.6) and 2.5\xa0mL of potassium ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)6] (1\xa0%). The mixture was incubated at 50\xa0°C for 20\xa0min. 2.5\xa0mL of 10\xa0% trichloroacetic acid was added and the tubes were centrifuged for 10\xa0min at 3000\xa0rpm. The supernatant (1.25\xa0mL) was mixed with 1.25\xa0mL of distilled water and 0.25\xa0mL of 0.1\xa0% ferric chloride solution. The absorbance was measured at 700\xa0nm in a V-1100 spectrophotometer. Higher absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated greater reducing power. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The results were expressed in μg ascorbic acid equivalent per mg of EO (μg AAE/mg) using the equation below based on the calibration curve: The free radical scavenging activity of the EOs was evaluated as described by Sanchez et al. [49] with slight modifications, based on the ability of test compounds to neutralize DPPH radical. The conversion of the stable violet DPPH radical into a yellow reduced form (DPPH/H+) is observed simultaneously. The test samples were prepared in methanol and 100\xa0μL of each sample (1.25 to 10\xa0μg/mL for essential oils) was added to 1900\xa0μL of freshly prepared 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) solution (50\xa0mg/L) in pure methanol. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control and 2\xa0mL of 50\xa0mg/L DPPH/methanol solution was used as negative control. The content of each preparation was mixed and incubated at room temperature in a dark cupboard for 10\xa0min. The absorbance was measured at 517\xa0nm in a V-1100 spectrophotometer. All tests were carried out in triplicate. The radical scavenging activity (RSA) was calculated as a percentage of DPPH radical scavenging, using the equation here below: Where Ablank is the absorbance of the control (containing all reagents except the test sample) and Asample is the absorbance of tested EO solution. The SC50 values (concentration of sample required to scavenge 50\xa0% of free radicals) were calculated from the regression equations derived by the least-square method and prepared from the different concentrations of both ethanol extracts and essential oils. The higher the SC50 the lower the antioxidant activity of the assayed sample. Ascorbic acid was used as reference. The antioxidant activity was then calculated and expressed as the antioxidant activity index (AAI): AAI\u2009=\u2009final concentration of DPPH in the control sample (μg.ml−1)/SC50 (μg.ml−1). Scherer and Godoy’s criteria were considered [50] depending on whether the EOs showed weak antioxidant activity (AAI\u2009<\u20090.5), moderate antioxidant activity (AAI, between 0.5 and 1.0), strong antioxidant activity (AAI, between 1.0 and 2.0) and very strong antioxidant activity when AAI\u2009>\u20092.0. Anti-denaturation assay was conducted as described by Biswakanth et al. [51] with slight modifications. The reaction mixture consisted of EO samples at different concentrations and 1\xa0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction prepared in saline phosphate buffer (pH\u2009=\u20097.4). The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 6.8 using small amounts of glacial acetic acid. The test tubes were incubated at 72\xa0° C for 5\xa0min and then cooled for 10\xa0min. The absorbance of these solutions was determined using a spectrophotometer (Mapada V-1100) at a wavelength of 660\xa0nm. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The percentage inhibition of precipitation (denaturation of the protein) was determined on a percentage basis relative to the control using the formula: All the grouped data were statistically evaluated with GraphPad InStat software. Hypothesis testing methods included one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All the results were expressed as mean\u2009±\u2009s.d. The regression equations and correlation coefficients were obtained by the least-square method. The extraction yields of the EOs are shown in Table\xa01. The yield ranged from 0.007\xa0% for A. cepa to 0.2\xa0% for A. sativum bulbs. The extraction yield of red bulb A. cepa was similar to that previously found by Mnayer et al. [52] (0.006 to 0.013\xa0%) while the yield of A. sativum bulbs was similar to that obtained by the same author but, higher (0.09\xa0%) than that observed in a previous study by Khadri et al. [53]. However, the yield obtained in this study represents only half of the yield obtained by Lawrence and Lawrence (0.4\xa0%) [54]. As regards D. gossweileri, its stem bark gave a yield of 0.04\xa0%. This yield was different from those obtained by Eyele et al. (0.2\xa0%) [55]; Agnaniet et al. (0.19\xa0%) [56]; Ngono (0.007 and 0.29\xa0%) and [32] Mbouma (0.023 to 0.088\xa0%) [33]. The roots of P. brazzeana gave a yield of 0.02\xa0% which was similar to those found in previous studies by Koudou et al. [39], Ndoye [40], Ngono [32] and Tchinang et al. [41]. However, this yield is lower than those found by Koudou et al. [39] and Nyegue et al. [42], respectively 0.35, 0.2 and 0.13\xa0%. The results of the chemical analysis are presented in Table\xa01. GC-MS analysis of Allium sativum EO revealed 22 components representing 100\xa0% of the total EO. The major components were diallyl trisulfide (41.62\xa0%), diallyl disulfide (19.74\xa0%), allyl methyl trisulfide (12.95\xa0%), diallyl sulfide (7.1\xa0%) and diallyl tetrasulfide (4.22\xa0%). This chemical profile was closed to that obtained by Mnayer et al. [52], but with slight difference in that diallyl disulfide (37.90\xa0%) was predominant compared to diallyl trisulfide (28.06\xa0%), while the allyl methyl trisulfide (7.26\xa0%) represented almost half of its content in the previous study [52]. Furthermore, studies conducted by Khadri et al. [53] showed that allyl methyl trisulfide (34.61\xa0%) and diallyl disulfide (31.65\xa0%) were rather the major constituents of the EO of Allium sativum. However, it is worth noting that, in the two previous studies [52, 53], allyl methyl disulfide was present in the chemical composition of the Allium sativum essential oil, contrarily to this study where it is pratically absent. Nonetheless, different studies on the chemical composition of A. sativum essential oil showed that diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide are the two major compounds of the EO of A. sativum [52, 57, 58]. Twenty one constituents representing 98.77\xa0% of the total EO were identified in the Allium cepa EO. The main components were diallyl trisulfide (22.17\xa0%), dipropyl trisulfide (11.11\xa0%), 2-methyl-3, 4-dithiaheptane (9.88\xa0%), methyl propyl trisulfide (8.14\xa0%), dipropyl tetrasulfide (8.07\xa0%) and 2-propenyl propyl disulfide (5.15\xa0%). The chemical composition of A. cepa used in this study differed greatly from previous reports in which dipropyl disulfide was reported to be the major compound present [52, 57]. Analysis of the chemical compositions of the EO of D. gossweileri stem barks revealed 17 compounds representing 99.70\xa0% of the total EO. Benzylisothiocyanate was the main component, representing 63.19\xa0% followed by benzylcyanide (35.72\xa0%). These results are in agreement with those of Eyele et al. [55], Ngono [32] and Mbouma [33] who documented that benzylisothiocyanate (56.5 to 95.6\xa0%) and benzylcyanide (4.3 to 32.3\xa0%) were also the major compounds of D. gossweileri EO. However, Agnaniet et al., [56], reported that benzylcyanide (73.7\xa0%) was the main compound in D. gossweileri stem bark EO from Gabon, instead of benzylisothiocyanate (5.2\xa0%). As for the EO of P. brazzeana roots, four components were identified, representing 100\xa0% of the total oil. The main compound found was benzylisothiocyanate (97.63\xa0%). Benzylisothiocyanate has been reported by Ndoye [40], Nyegue et al. [41], Ngono [32] and Tchinang et al. [41] to be the major compound present in P. brazzeana EO. It was observed that the chemical composition of the aforementioned essential oils differs greatly among genus, and also among the same species. This is possibly due to analytical techniques, chemotypes, and differences in cultivars of the plants, culture climate and other growth conditions which might affect the chemical composition [38, 59]. The Total Phenolic Contents (TPC) of Allium sativum, Allium cepa, D. gossweileiri and P. brazzeana essential oils (EOs) are presented in Table\xa02. From our literature review, there is no scientific investigation on the determination of the TPC of the EOs of D. gossweileri stem barks and P. brazzeana roots. The results indicate that the TPC of the EOs ranged from 342.20\u2009±\u20090.99 to 429.33\u2009±\u20091.31\xa0μg AAE/mg. The highest level of phenolics were found in both A. sativum and A. cepa EOs (463.38\u2009±\u20091.24 and 429.33\u2009±\u20091.31\xa0μg AAE/mg), while the lowest contents were recorded in the EOs of D. gossweileri stem barks and P. brazzeana roots (365.38\u2009±\u20090.66\xa0μg AAE/mg and 342.20\u2009±\u20090.99\xa0μg AAE/mg). These results do not match with those of Abdel-Salam et al. [60] who showed that TPC of red A. sativum are lower than those of red A. cepa. Generally, EOs possess significant secondary metabolites from plants, particularly the active lipophilic compounds. This might be due to the fact that phenolic compounds are often extracted in higher amounts by using polar solvents such as water [61]. Phenolic antioxidants are products of secondary metabolism in plants and their antioxidant activity is mainly due to their redox properties and chemical structure, which might play an important role in chelating transition metals and scavenging free radicals [62]. Consequently, the antioxidant activities of plant extracts are often explained by their total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Also, the sterical structures of antioxidants or free radicals are known to play a more important role in their abilities to scavenge different types of free radicals [63]. The ferric reducing power in the EOs of A. cepa, A. sativum, D. gossweileiri, P. brazzeana is presented in Table\xa02. Form our literature review; there is no scientific report on the determination of the ferric reducing power of D. gossweileri and P. brazzeana EOs. Their ferric reducing capacity ranged from 0.08\u2009±\u20090.03 to 2.75\u2009±\u20090.02\xa0μg AAE/mg. The highest reducing power was found in A. sativum EO (5.33\u2009±\u20090.01\xa0μg AAE/mg), followed by the A. cepa EO (2.75\u2009±\u20090.02\xa0μg AAE/mg), D. gossweileiri EO (0.76\u2009±\u20090.03\xa0μg AAE/mg) and finally, EO (0.08\u2009±\u20090.03\xa0μg AAE/mg) of P. brazzeana. These results are comparable to that of Benkeblia et al. [64] who found that A. cepa and A. sativum showed the highest reducing capacity with 107 and 196\xa0%, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the ferric reducing antioxidant power of D. gossweileiri EO was 10 folds greater than that of P. brazzeana EO. This might be ascribed to the presence of more phenolic compounds [65] in D. gossweileiri than in P. brazzeana. The ability to reduce the ferricyanide complex of Fe3+ to the ferrous (Fe2+) form might be attributed to the hydrogen donating ability of phenolic compounds [66], which is indicative of the presence of a reducing agent [67]. In addition, the number and position of the hydroxyl groups in phenolic compounds also govern their antioxidant activity [68]. However, Amagase et al. [69] argued that this antioxidant activity could be attributed to the organosulfur compounds. Tables\xa03 and 4 show the radical scavenging activity (RSA) of the EOs of A. cepa, A. sativum, D. gossweileiri and P. brazzeana. The stable free radical DPPH was used to test the ability of the EOs and ascorbic acid to donate hydrogen ion. The scavenging effects of the EOs on DPPH radical increased as the EO concentration increased. All the EOs were able to reduce the stable free radical 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) to the yellow diphenylpicrylhydrazine with varying degrees of scavenging capacities. Great bleaching action (from purple to yellow) reflected a higher antioxidant activity and thus a lower SC50. The SC50 values increased in the following order: P. brazzeana\u2009<\u2009A. sativum\u2009<\u2009D. gossweileri\u2009<\u2009A. cepa\u2009<\u2009ascorbic acid. These results indicate that EOs exhibited a significant DPPH radical scavenging activity about 10 folds more active than ascorbic acid. Thus, the EOs were found to be better antioxidants. These results are in agreement with the findings of Agnaniet et al. [56], Ngono [32] and Mnayer et al. [52], but in disaccordance with those found by Ndoye [40], Nyegue et al. [42], Lee et al. [24] and Abdel-Salam et al. [60]. Mnayer et al. [52] showed that Allium sativum EO was a more effective DPPH radical scavenger (SC50\u2009=\u20097.67\xa0mg/mL) than Allium cepa EO (SC50\u2009=\u200920.19\xa0mg/mL). On the contrary, Lee et al. [24] and Abdel-Salam et al. [60] reported that Allium cepa EO exhibited higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than A. sativum EO. Moreover, Negue et al. [42] found that P. brazzeana EO exhibited a weak DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA\u2009=\u200914\xa0% for 1\xa0g/L, SC50\u2009=\u20091.5\xa0mg/mL and SC50\u2009=\u20093.23\xa0mg/mL) in comparison with the results of the present study. However, Ngono [32] stated that although the RSA of both the EO of P. brazzeana roots and D. gossweileri stem barks were weak, the RSA of P. brazzeana EO was higher than that of D. gossweileri EO. The major components of the EO (benzylisothiocyanate and benzylcyanide) of these two plants could not be responsible for the antiradical activity, but it might be due to the synergetic action between different components or the contribution of some minor components [41]. It has been shown that benzylisothiocyanate and benzylcyanide tested individually were found to be less active than the whole EO. Using Scherer and Godoy’s criteria [49], EO showed very strong antioxidant activity (AAI\u2009>\u20092), while ascorbic acid showed a strong antioxidant activity index (1\u2009<\u2009AAI\u2009<\u20092). It is interesting to note that there were weak linear correlations between the total phenolic concentration and the FRAP values or DPPH radical scavenging percentage, with coefficients, R2\u2009=\u20090.22 and 0.21 respectively (Table\xa04). These results show that most antioxidant compounds might be organosulfur compounds. Indeed, the antioxidant activity of Allium species is attributed partly to its sulfur compounds, which represent the main constituents of these EO [57, 70, 71]. Amagase et al. [69] reported that diallyl polysulphides contributed to the antioxidant properties of the EOs. In addition, the antioxidant activity is also related to other minor bioactive compounds: dietary fibers, microelements (especially selenium) and polyphenols [72] which potentialize antioxidant activity. The different antioxidant activities between these EO might be due to the variability of the chemical composition and sulfides concentration. It might also be attributed to the presence and synergitic action of the different trace compounds. Anti-denaturation of bovine serum albumin method was used to evaluate the anti inflammatory property of the EOs of A. cepa, A. sativum, D. gossweileiri and P. brazzeana. The results are summarized in Table\xa05. All the EOs protected the BSA against heat induced denaturation. The percentage of BSA protection against heat increased with increasing concentration. The present findings show a concentration dependent inhibition of protein (albumin) denaturation by EOs from 3.125 to 125\xa0μg/mL. Sodium diclofenac at the same concentration range was used as the reference drug and it also exhibited a concentration dependent inhibition of protein denaturation. Indeed, the effect of sodium diclofenac against heat denaturation of BSA was found to be about 2 folds lower than that of A. cepa and P. brazzeana EO. P. brazzeana EO was found to be 2 folds more active than D. gossweileri EO. The anti-inflammatory activity of P. brazzeana EO was to a lesser extent comparable to that of A. cepa. These observations were confirmed by comparing their IC50 values. To the best of our knowledge, no study on the in vitro anti-inflammatory properties of the EOs of D. gossweileri has been published. However, [42] reported that the anti-inflammatory activity of the EO of P. brazzeana root is about 100 folds less active (35\u2009±\u20095\xa0μg/mL) than that of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (0.23\u2009±\u20090.02\xa0μg/mL) against the soybean 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. The IC50 of P. brazzeana EO found in this study is slightly higher (45.66\xa0μg/mL) than that reported by Nyegue et al. [42] using a different method. This means that the EO sample used by Nyegue et al. [42] was slightly more active than the present EO sample. This could be explained by the fact that the EO sample used by the aforementioned author contained more compounds (11) than the EO sample used in this investigation, which contained only 4 components (Table\xa01). Concerning the antiradical, anti-inflammatory activities of the EO of P. brazzeana and D. gossweileri, these activities might be due to the synergetic action of several components or the contribution of trace components. Nyegue et al. [42] reported that the two main components (benzyisothiocyanate and benzylcyanide) tested individually were found to be less active than the whole essential oil. In order to valorize some organosulfur plants from Cameroon as dietary, cosmetic and pharmaceutical additives, the chemical composition, in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the essential oils of A. sativum, A. cepa, D. gossweileri and P.brazzeana were investigated in this study. This paper reveals that the essential oils of D. gossweileri stem barks and P. brazzeana roots as well as those of the red bulbs of A.sativum and A. cepa are all effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. The findings of this study support the popular use of these plants against inflammatory skin disorders and inflammatory-related diseases in West-Cameroon, though additional studies are necessary to test other enzymatic systems that trigger the development of the inflammatory process and also address their mechanism of action. The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are presented in this main paper. Plant materials used in this study have been identified at the Cameroon National Herbarium where voucher specimens are deposited. Not applicable in this section. Not applicable in this section.

The bioelectrochemical reactions and system have direct impact in biotechnological development, in medical devices designing, in the behavior of DNA-protein complexes, in green-energy and bioenergy concepts, and make it possible an understanding of metabolism of all living organisms (e.g. humans) where biomolecules are integral to health and proper functioning. In the last years, many researchers have dedicated itself to study different redox enzymes by using electrochemistry, aiming to understand their mechanisms and to develop promising bioanodes and biocathodes for biofuel cells as well as to develop biosensors and implantable bioelectronics devices. Inside this scope, this review try to introduce and contemplate some relevant topics for enzyme bioelectrochemistry, such as the immobilization of the enzymes at electrode surfaces, the electron transfer, the bioelectrocatalysis, and new techniques conjugated with electrochemistry vising understand the kinetics and thermodynamics of redox proteins. Furthermore, examples of recent approaches in designing biosensors and biofuel developed are presented. The term “bioelectrochemistry” can be defined as the area of the science that utilizes electrochemical principles and techniques to investigate processes of biological relevance (Guidelli et al. 2001GUIDELLI R, ALOISI G, BECUCCI L, DOLFI A, MONCELLI MR AND BUONINSEGNI FT. 2001. New directions and challenges in electrochemistry - Bioelectrochemistry at metal/water interfaces. J Electroanal Chem 504: 1-28.), in particular, focusing on the electrochemical properties of biological molecules. Since 1933, when Brdicka (Brdicka 1933BRDICKA R. 1933. Polarographic studies with the dropping mercury kathode. Part XXXI. A new test for proteins in the presence of cobalt salts in ammoniacal solutions of ammonium chloride. Collect Czech Chem Commun 5: 112-128.) discovered the catalytic properties of proteins, scientists have studied their bioelectrochemistry, and the investigation of the fundamental features of electron transfer (ET) in proteins has aroused great interest for the development of devices such as biosensors and biofuel cell for medical applications. Although there are many different kinds of proteins, research into the electrochemistry of redox enzymes increased in the late 1960s, mainly because of the promise of viable biosensors for medical applications such as blood glucose determination (Czaban 1985CZABAN JD. 1985. Electrochemical sensors in clinical chemistry: yesterday, today, tomorrow. Anal Chem 57: A345-356A.). Initially, enzyme electrochemistry was performed in solution, but good results were not obtained because of the adsorption and denaturation of the enzymes on the electrode surfaces and the highly irreversible electrode reactions that are related to electrode fouling (Armstrong 1990ARMSTRONG FA. 1990. Probing metalloproteins by voltammetry. Struct Bonding 72: 137-230.). At the same time, electrochemical enzyme biosensors were developed using enzymes immobilized in films on electrodes (Kauffmann and Guilbault 1992KAUFFMANN JM AND GUILBAULT GG. 1992. Enzyme electrode biosensors: theory and applications. In Bioanalytical application of enzymes, Methods of Biochemical Analysis, New York: Willey, p. 66-113., Guilbault 1984), and it was demonstrated that enzymes immobilized in films retain high catalytic activity, even though mediators must be used to shuttle electrons between the enzymes and the electrode surfaces instead of direct electron transfer (DET). Although bioelectrochemistry and bioelectrocatalysis have been investigated since 1933, Table I summarizes the books that were published in this field for the last 20 years. Besides proteins, DNA is another biomolecule that has been studied recently by electrochemistry (Bartels et al. 2017BARTELS P, ZHOU A, ARNOLD A, NUNEZ N, CRESPILHO F, DAVID S AND BARTON J. 2017. Electrochemistry of the [4Fe4S] Cluster in Base Excision Repair Proteins: Tuning the Redox Potential with DNA. Langmuir 33: 2523-2530.); however, this topic is out of the scope of this review. Here, we will summarize some important topics in the field of bioelectrochemistry related to enzymes, such as the enzymes that have been studied to develop different types of biosensors and the bioanodes and biocathodes developed for biofuel cells. In addition, we will discuss how ET occurs between enzymes and the electrode surfaces. Moreover, we will discuss how modification of the protein-electrode interface could improve the ET because this a key parameter for improving the communication between the protein and the electrode surface. Lastly, some examples of the applications of this area are given, such as the development of biosensors and biofuel cells. Enzymes are divided into six main classes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases, and this division is based on the type of reaction catalyzed by the enzyme (Nelson and Cox 2005NELSON DL AND COX MM. 2005. Principles of Biochemistry. New York: Freeman and Company, 1340 p.). Here, we are interested in the oxidoreductases, which are responsible to catalyze biological oxidation and reduction reactions. The oxidoreductases can be divided into dehydrogenases, oxygenases, and oxidases (May and Padgette 1983MAY SW AND PADGETTE SR. 1983. Oxidoreductase enzymes in biotechnology - current status and future potential. Bio-Technology 1: 677-686.), where the dehydrogenases are considered the largest type of this class of enzyme. Dehydrogenases can be sub-divided by their cofactor and coenzymes requirements, for example, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P))-dependent or flavin coenzyme-dependent, and they are used in the development of bioanodes of biofuel cells. For example, glucose dehydrogenase (GDh) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) are two enzymes that have been utilized to develop biodevices. GDh catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone, according to Equation 1 and ADH catalyzes the reversible interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, where Equation 2 is an example of ethanol oxidation utilizing an ADH β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzyme. Oxygenases are known to incorporate molecular oxygen directly into organic substrates and exhibit very high efficiency and selectivity. They convert alkanes to alcohols, olefins to epoxides, sulfides to sulfoxides, and cleave aromatic rings or oxidize their substituents. The oxygenases are divided into two classes: dioxygenases and monooxygenases. The first type incorporates both atoms of an oxygen molecule into the organic substrate, while the second incorporates only one atom of molecular oxygen into the substrate, and the other oxygen atom is reduced to water at the expense of a reductant, such as NAD(P)H (May and Padgette 1983MAY SW AND PADGETTE SR. 1983. Oxidoreductase enzymes in biotechnology - current status and future potential. Bio-Technology 1: 677-686.). The last type of oxidoreductases is the oxidases, which include flavoprotein oxidases, metalloflavoprotein oxidases, and hemeprotein oxidases. In this case, the most used enzyme for electrochemical studies is glucose oxidase (GOx). This enzyme is responsible for the catalytic oxidation of the glucose to gluconolactone using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor, and its product is non-enzymatically hydrolyzed to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (Bankar et al. 2009BANKAR SB, BULE MV, SINGHAL RS AND ANANTHANARAYAN L. 2009. Glucose oxidase - An overview. Biotechnol Adv 27: 489-501.). All enzymes have a polypeptide backbone arranged in secondary and tertiary structures and feature a redox cofactor that might be metal complexes or an organic molecule bound to a specific site. Thus, the most common redox cofactors, so-called redox-active centers, are quinones, flavins, NAD(P)H, hemes, iron-sulfur clusters, and copper centers. The quinones are two-electron, two-proton redox centers and are known to be hydrogen atom carriers, which implies that their redox reactions vary with pH. For this species, the intermediate semiquinone radical is accessible and often stable, allowing sequential one-electron oxidation or reduction reactions (Bartlett 2008BARTLETT P. 2008. Bioelectrochemistry: fundamentals, experimental techniques and applications. New Jersey: J Wiley & Sons, 494 p.). Flavins are divided into flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and they are also two-electron, two-proton redox centers (Walsh 1980WALSH C. 1980. Flavin coenzymes: at the crossroads of biological redox chemistry. Acc Chem Res 13: 148-155.). As for quinones, their redox potentials are pH-dependent. NAD+ and NADP+ are two-electron, one-proton redox couples. In this case, the intermediate radicals are not accessible, and they are considered hydride carriers in biological systems. The difference between them is the presence of an additional phosphate on the ribose ring of the adenosine; however, their redox potentials are the same (Bartlett 2008BARTLETT P. 2008. Bioelectrochemistry: fundamentals, experimental techniques and applications. New Jersey: J Wiley & Sons, 494 p.). Heme groups are formed by a porphyrin ring, comprising four pyrrole rings linked by methylene bridges with a Fe2+ ion coordinated in the center. There are different heme types, which vary according to the substitution around the porphyrin ring; consequently, the redox potential of the iron center is affected, causing the redox potentials of these groups to vary. For iron-sulfur clusters, iron atoms are bonded to sulfur atoms on cysteine residues of the associated protein and inorganic sulfur atoms, and these function as multielectron redox centers that can pick up or release one electron at a time (Beinert et al. 1997BEINERT H, HOLM RH AND MÜNCK E. 1997. Iron-sulfur clusters: nature´s modular, multipurpose structures. Science 277: 563-569.). Lastly, there are copper centers, where copper acts as a one-electron center, changing between the Cu+ and Cu2+ states. An enzyme reaction at an electrode surface can proceed in two ways. The first approach is mediated electron transfer (Figure 1a), which is based on the utilization of redox mediators and, in this case, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation or reduction of the mediator (Cardosi and Turner 1987CARDOSI MF AND TURNER APF. 1987. Biosensors: fundamentals and applications. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 786 p., Bartlett et al. 1991BARTLETT PN, TEBBUTT P AND WHITAAKER RG. 1991. Kinetic aspects of the use of modified electrodes and mediators in bioelectrochemistry. Prog React Kinet 16: 55-155.). In this type of system, the catalytic process involves the enzymatic transformation of the analyte and the mediator. In the second, in contrast, direct (mediatorless) electron transfer occurs (Figure 1b) (Tarasevich 1985TARASEVICH MR. 1985. Bioelectrocatalysis. In: Srinivasan SC, Yu A, Chizmadzhev YA, Bockris JOM, Conway BE and Yeager E (Eds), Comprehensive treatise of electrochemistry. New York: Plenum Press, 788 p.). In this case, the electron is directly transferred from the active center of the enzyme to the electrode surface, which provides important information about the thermodynamics and kinetics of the biological redox process. Because many proteins have their redox sites buried deeply in their structure, the redox center is isolated from the environment; thus, DET with bulk electrodes is hindered. In this case, the electrical communication between the enzyme and the electrode surface can be established by using charge-carriers, so-called ET mediators. These agents are artificial electron acceptor or donor molecules able to shuttle electrons from the redox center of the enzyme to the electrode and vice versa (Katz et al. 2007KATZ E, SHIPWAY AN AND WILLNER I. 2007. Mediated electron-transfer between redox-enzymes and electrode supports. In Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry. Wiley-VCH.). An ideal redox mediator should provide a rapid reaction with the enzyme, exhibit reversible electrochemistry (large rate constant for the interfacial ET at the electrode surface), be stable in the oxidized and reduced forms under the working conditions, have a low overpotential for regeneration, and do not participate in side reactions during ET. Furthermore, the redox potential of the mediator should be more positive for oxidative biocatalysis and more negative for reductive biocatalysis, compared to the redox potential of the enzyme active site (Chaubey and Malhotra 2002CHAUBEY A AND MALHOTRA BD. 2002. Mediated biosensors. Biosens Bioelectron 17: 441-456.). There are several redox mediators ranging from organic to inorganic molecules, including methylene blue, methyl violet, Prussian blue, thionin, toluidine blue, quinone derivates, ferrocene and its derivates, and inorganic redox ions such as ferri/ferrocyanide (Kavanagh and Leech 2013KAVANAGH P AND LEECH D. 2013. Mediated electron transfer in glucose oxidising enzyme electrodes for application to biofuel cells: recent progress and perspectives. Phys Chem Chem Phys 15: 4859-4869.). For the selection of a suitable mediator, some factors must be considered, such as the redox potential, stability, and solubility under the working conditions, and the properties of the enzyme and the mediator (Kavanagh and Leech 2013). This is because the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the mediator and the enzyme and the size and shape of the mediator affect the penetration of the mediator close to the enzyme redox site (Katz et al. 2007KATZ E, SHIPWAY AN AND WILLNER I. 2007. Mediated electron-transfer between redox-enzymes and electrode supports. In Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry. Wiley-VCH.). Several designs of mediated bioelectrochemical systems have been developed. These systems can involve from soluble enzymes with diffusional electron mediators to sophisticated architectures with multistep mediated ET. The simplest system configuration involves the enzyme and mediator in solution, i.e., homogeneous mediation. In this case, the mediator reacts with the enzyme in the bulk solution and diffuses to the electrode, where it is regenerated (Kavanagh and Leech 2013KAVANAGH P AND LEECH D. 2013. Mediated electron transfer in glucose oxidising enzyme electrodes for application to biofuel cells: recent progress and perspectives. Phys Chem Chem Phys 15: 4859-4869.). This kind of system is useful for studying the enzyme-mediator interactions, for example, the influence of structure mediators in the redox reaction with the enzyme (Forrow et al. 2002FORROW NJ, SANGHERA GS AND WALTERS SJ. 2002. The influence of structure in the reaction of electrochemically generated ferrocenium derivatives with reduced glucose oxidase. J Chem Soc Dalton Trans 16: 3187-3194.). Other systems employ heterogeneous electron mediation (Patolsky et al. 1998PATOLSKY F, TAO G, KATZ E AND WILLNER I. 1998. C60-mediated bioelectrocatalyzed oxidation of glucose oxidase. J Electroanal Chem 454: 9-13.), where the enzyme (or mediator) is immobilized on the electrode surface or in a 3-D matrix, and the mediator (or enzyme) diffuses from the bulk solution. Alternatively, both enzyme and mediator can be incorporated into the electrode surface (Reuillard et al. 2013REUILLARD B, LE GOFF A, AGNES C, HOLZINGER M, ZEBDA A, GONDRAN C, ELOUARZAKI K AND COSNIER S. 2013. High power enzymatic biofuel cell based on naphthoquinone-mediated oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase in a carbon nanotube 3D matrix. Phys Chem Chem Phys 15: 4892-4896., Luz and Crespilho 2016LUZ RAS AND CRESPILHO FN. 2016. Gold nanoparticle-mediated electron transfer of cytochrome c on a self-assembled surface. RSC Adv 6: 62585-62593.). These systems produce high currents because the enzyme and mediator are present in high concentration at the electrode surface. An alternative approach to the mediated system is the use of soluble enzymes functionalized with electron mediators. For example, GOx has been covalently modified with ferrocene, osmium, and ruthenium complexes by the formation of bonds with lysine or histidine residues (Katz et al. 2007KATZ E, SHIPWAY AN AND WILLNER I. 2007. Mediated electron-transfer between redox-enzymes and electrode supports. In Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry. Wiley-VCH.). The utilization of mediated ET system must be carefully considered. Although it facilitates the electrical connection between enzymes and electrodes, providing biofuel cells with large currents, power outputs, and small voltage losses, resulting in sensitive biosensors, the use of mediators can limit the application of bioelectrochemical devices. This is because many redox mediators are toxic, which precludes the implantation of these devices in vivo (Falk et al. 2013FALK M, VILLARRUBIA CWN, BABANOVA S, ATANASSOV P AND SHLEEV S. 2013. Biofuel cells for biomedical applications: colonizing the animal kingdom. ChemPhysChem 14: 2045-2058.). Moreover, the miniaturization of devices with mediated ET processes is quite complicated because the compartmentalization of the device using membranes is necessary. Nowadays, many researchers are interested in achieving DET between an electrode and the active center of an enzyme, and this is very important for the development of next-generation enzyme biosensors and biofuel cells (Willner 2002WILLNER I. 2002. Biomaterials for sensors, fuel cells, and circuitry. Science 298: 2407-2408.). In addition, non-mediated bioelectrochemistry at solid electrodes has been developed as a potentially powerful method for mechanistic studies of redox proteins (Frew and Hill 1988FREW JE AND HILL HAO. 1988. Direct and indirect electron-transfer between electrodes and redox proteins. Eur J Biochem 172: 261-269.). DET has been observed in redox proteins where the redox center is close to the surface of the protein, such as cytochrome c (Eddowes and Hill 1977EDDOWES MJ AND HILL H. 1977. Novel method for investigation of electrochemistry of metalloproteins - Cytochrome-C. J Chem Soc Chem: Commun 771-772.) and ferredoxin (Armstrong et al. 1982ARMSTRONG FA, HILL HAO AND WALTON NJ. 1982. Direct electrochemical oxidation of Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin: identification of facile electron-transfer processes relevant to cluster degradation. FEBS Lett 150: 214-218.). However, for proteins such as GOx where the prosthetic group, FAD, is deeply embedded within a protective protein shell, it is difficult to observe this type of charge transfer. An immobilized enzyme capable of DET will allow the electrochemical measurement of the enzyme substrate without the addition of any mediator to analyze the ET process (Zhao et al. 1992ZHAO JG, HENKENS RW, STONEHUERNER J, ODALY JP AND CRUMBLISS AL. 1992. Direct electron-transfer at horseradish peroxidase - colloidal gold modified electrodes. J Electroanal Chem 327: 109-119.). In addition, it has been suggested that DET may proceed most easily to or from electrode surfaces when the environment is similar to the native environment of the redox protein (Zhao et al. 1992). Thus, obtaining DET between enzymes and electrode surfaces is important, once this process could be applied to the study of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in biological systems and in the investigation of the mechanisms of redox reactions at enzymes molecules (Cai and Chen 2004CAI CX AND CHEN J. 2004. Direct electron transfer and bioelectrocatalysis of hemoglobin at a carbon nanotube electrode. Anal Biochem. 325: 285-292.). The first reports of DET with a redox-active protein were published in 1977 independently by Eddowes and Hill (Eddowes and Hill 1977EDDOWES MJ AND HILL H. 1977. Novel method for investigation of electrochemistry of metalloproteins - Cytochrome-C. J Chem Soc Chem: Commun 771-772.) and by Yeh and Kuwana (Yeh and Kuwana 1977YEH P AND KUWANA T. 1977. Reversible electrode-reaction of cytochrome-C. Chem Lett 1145-1148.). They showed the reversible electrochemistry, using cyclic voltammetry (CV), of cytochrome-c on bipyridyl-modified gold and tin-doped indium oxide electrodes. Subsequently, in 1978/1979, Russian scientists reported indirect evidence that DET was also possible for larger redox proteins with enzyme activity. In this case, it was shown that laccase-modified (Berezin et al. 1978BEREZIN IV, BOGDANOVSKAYA VA, VARFOLOMEEV SD, TARASEVICH MR AND YAROPOLOV A. I. 1978. Bioelectrocatalysis. Equilibrium oxygen potential in the presence of laccase. Dokl Akad Nauk 240: 615-618., Tarasevich et al. 1979TARASEVICH MR, YAROPOLOV AI, BOGDANOVSKAYA VA AND VARFOLOMEEV SD. 1979. Electrocatalysis of a cathodic oxygen reduction by laccase. Bioelectrochem Bioenerg 6: 393-403.) and peroxidase-modified (Yaropolov et al. 1979YAROPOLOV AI, MALOVIK V, VARFOLOMEEV SD AND BEREZIN IV. 1979. Electroreduction of hydrogen peroxide on an electrode with immobilized peroxidase. Dokl Akad Nauk 249: 1399-1401.) carbon electrodes exhibit DET in the presence of their substrates. Many redox proteins have demonstrated efficient DET reactions; however, these proteins have no intrinsic catalytic activity but act as ET components in biochemical pathways, e.g., ferredoxins and azurin (Guo and Hill 1991GUO LH AND HILL HAP. 1991. Direct electrochemistry of proteins and enzymes. Adv Inorg Chem 36: 341-375.). On the other hand, efficient DET reactions with electrodes have been reported for few redox enzymes, e.g., GOx (Martins et al. 2014MARTINS, MVA, PEREIRA AR, LUZ RAS, IOST RM AND CRESPILHO FN. 2014. Evidence of short-range electron transfer of a redox enzyme on graphene oxide electrodes. Phys Chem Chem Phys 16: 17426-17436.) and bilirubin oxidase (Shleev et al. 2005bSHLEEV S, TKAC J, CHRISTENSON A, RUZGAS T, YAROPOLOV AI, WHITTAKER JW AND GORTON L. 2005b. Direct electron transfer between copper-containing proteins and electrodes. Biosens Bioelectron 20: 2517-2554.). In principle, two experimental approaches could establish if DET occurs between the enzyme and the electrode surface: indirect evidence based on the catalytic response current in the presence of the substrate and direct evidence from the independent electrochemical activity of the redox cofactor in the absence of the substrate. Many enzymes with known DET properties contain a metallocenter at the active site, e.g., heme, iron-sulfur cluster, and copper (Gorton et al. 1999GORTON L, LINDGREN A, LARSSON T, MUNTEANU FD, RUZGAS T AND GAZARYAN I. 1999. Direct electron transfer between heme-containing enzymes and electrodes as basis for third generation biosensors. Anal Chim Acta 400: 91-108.), as exemplified in Figure 2a. However, there are some enzymes with DET properties that contain only an organic cofactor, such as flavin (Figure 2b) (Wilson and Turner 1992WILSON R AND TURNER APF. 1992. Glucose oxidase: an ideal enzyme. Biosen Bioelectron 7: 165-185.). For DET occurrence in the redox proteins, there are some prerequisites. According to Marcus theory (Marcus 1956MARCUS RA. 1956. On the theory of oxidation-reduction reactions involving electron transfer. J Chem Phys 24: 966-978.), the DET rate between two redox sites will depend on three factors: the reorganization energy, which is divided into the inner and outer contributions, where the first is related to the energy necessary to modify bond distances and the second is related to the energy necessary to reorganize the solvent; the potential difference between the redox centers; and the distance between the redox sites (Carter et al. 1995CARTER MT, ROWE GK, RICHARDSON JN, TENDER LM, TERRILL RH AND MURRAY RW. 1995. Distance dependence of the low-temperature electron-transfer kinetics of (ferrocenylcarboxy)-terminated alkanethiol monolayers. J Am Chem Soc 117: 2896-2899.). Thus, ET between large redox proteins and the electrode surface is usually slow and sometimes difficult to achieve (Heller and Degani 1998HELLER A AND DEGANI Y. 1998. Redox chemistry and interfacial behavior of biological molecules. New York: Plenum Press, 672 p.) because the redox center is deeply embedded in the protein structure. As mentioned above, in many cases, a direct enzymatic electrochemical reaction is difficult because of factors such as the way in which the enzyme is adsorbed on the electrode surface, which could result in the denaturation and loss of electrochemical activity and bioactivity. Moreover, the large size of the enzyme results in the inaccessibility of the redox center, making it difficult to obtain DET (Cai and Chen 2004CAI CX AND CHEN J. 2004. Direct electron transfer and bioelectrocatalysis of hemoglobin at a carbon nanotube electrode. Anal Biochem. 325: 285-292.). Thus, one possibility to improve the DET between the electrode surface and the enzyme is to shorten the distance between the active center and the electrode by modifying the electrode surface or the protein structure, as will be described in Section Protein-electrode interfaces. Another approach that has been utilized is the incorporation of nanoparticles to the electrodes (Zhang et al. 2004ZHANG Y, HE PL AND HU NF. 2004. Horseradish peroxidase immobilized in TiO2 nanoparticle films on pyrolytic graphite electrodes: direct electrochemistry and bioelectrocatalysis. Electrochim Acta 49: 1981-1988., Gan et al. 2004GAN X, LIU T, ZHU XL AND LI GX. 2004. An electrochemical biosensor for nitric oxide based on silver nanoparticles and hemoglobin. Anal Sci 20: 1271-1275., Hilliard et al. 2002HILLIARD LR, ZHAO XJ AND TAN WH. 2002. Immobilization of oligonucleotides onto silica nanoparticles for DNA hybridization studies. Anal Chim Acta 470: 51-56., Pereira et al. 2011PEREIRA AR, IOST RM, MARTINS MVA, YOKOMIZO CH, DA SILVA WC, NANTES IL AND CRESPILHO FN. 2011. Molecular interactions and structure of a supramolecular arrangement of glucose oxidase and palladium nanoparticles. Phys Chem Chem Phys 13: 12155-12162.). This approach is promising because nanoparticles have high specific surface areas and excellent biocompatibility and conductivity. For example, gold nanoparticles can adsorb redox enzymes without loss of the enzyme activity (Hayat 1989HAYAT MA. 1989. Colloid gold: principles, methods, and applications. San Diego: Academic Press, 536 p.), and the nanoparticles act as conduction centers, facilitating the transfer of electrons. Zhao et al. 2006ZHAO S, ZHANG K, BAI Y, YANG W AND SUN C. 2006. Glucose oxidase/colloidal gold nanoparticles immobilized in Nafion film on glassy carbon electrode: direct electron transfer and electrocatalysis. Bioelectrochemistry 69: 158-163. showed the DET of GOx immobilized on gold nanoparticles by a Nafion film; moreover, they showed that GOx retains its electrocatalytic behavior for the oxidation of glucose. In addition, some materials present on the electrode surface can facilitate DET, as described by Cai and Chen (Cai and Chen 2004CAI CX AND CHEN J. 2004. Direct electron transfer and bioelectrocatalysis of hemoglobin at a carbon nanotube electrode. Anal Biochem. 325: 285-292.). They found that carbon nanotubes (CNT) improve the DET of hemoglobin. This could be attributed to the oxygen-containing groups (Musameh et al. 2002MUSAMEH M, WANG J, MERKOCI A AND LIN YH. 2002. Low-potential stable NADH detection at carbon-nanotube-modified glassy carbon electrodes. Electrochem Commun 4: 743-746.) present on the CNT surface, its small size, electronic structure, and electrical conductivity. Thus, both mediated and direct ET have advantages and disadvantages, and it is necessary to analyze the goal of the study and its applications to choose the most suitable method. Some parameters that govern ET can be modulated, such as the distance between the redox center of the protein and the electrode, the Fermi level of the electrode, and the protein orientation on the surface. Thus, the electrode interface plays a key role with regard to ET between the enzyme and the electrode surface. Thereby, to achieve charge transfer and bioelectrocatalysis of some enzymes, it is necessary to modify the electrode or protein structure. Nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, graphene, among others have been used to modify electrode surfaces successfully. Regarding the modification in enzyme structure, deglycosylation and oligomerization procedures have been employed to improve the ET and bioelectrocatalysis. In the case of electrode modification, “smart” materials, such as nanomaterials, have been incorporated on electrode surfaces to improve the ET. For instance, nanoparticles (Katz and Willner 2004KATZ E AND WILLNER I. 2004. Integrated nanoparticle-biomolecule hybrid systems: synthesis, properties, and applications. Angew Chem Int Ed 43: 6042-6108., Xiao et al. 2003XIAO Y, PATOLSKY F, KATZ E, HAINFELD JF AND WILLNER I. 2003. “Plugging into enzymes”: Nanowiring of redox enzymes by a gold nanoparticle. Science 299: 1877-1881., Crespilho 2006aCRESPILHO FN, GHICA ME, FLORESCU M, NART FC, OLIVEIRA ON AND BRETT CMA. 2006a. A strategy for enzyme immobilization on layer-by-layer dendrimer-gold nanoparticle electrocatalytic membrane incorporating redox mediator. Electrochem Commun 8: 1665-1670., b, 2008, 2009), carbon nanotubes (Azamian et al. 2002, Zhao et al. 2009ZHAO HY, ZHENG W, MENG ZX, ZHOU HM, XU XX, LI Z AND ZHENG YF. 2009. Bioelectrochemistry of hemoglobin immobilized on a sodium alginate-multiwall carbon nanotubes composite film. Biosens Bioelectron 24: 2352-2357.), and graphene (Gao and Duan 2015GAO H AND DUAN H. 2015. 2D and 3D graphene materials: preparation and bioelectrochemical applications. Biosens Bioelectron 65: 404-419., Kuila et al. 2011KUILA T, BOSE S, KHANRA P, MISHRA AK, KIM NH AND LEE JH. 2011. Recent advances in graphene-based biosensors. Biosens Bioelectron 26: 4637-4648.) have been used. Concerning nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be functionalized with organic molecules containing thiol groups (Xiao et al. 2003, Luz and Crespilho 2016LUZ RAS AND CRESPILHO FN. 2016. Gold nanoparticle-mediated electron transfer of cytochrome c on a self-assembled surface. RSC Adv 6: 62585-62593., Willner et al. 2006, 2007), and these molecules can provide wiring between the enzyme and electrode with a better protein orientation, which improves the ET. Figure 3 shows a simple method that uses the self-assembly of AuNPs, cysteine (Cys), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) (Luz and Crespilho 2016). In this study, a AuNP-modified electrode and an unmodified electrode were studied, and it was observed that the ET was facilitated by the incorporation of the AuNPs at the protein/electrode interface. Therefore, the presence of AuNPs decreases the effective ET distance between the redox center of Cyt-c and the electrode surface. Carbon nanotubes are interesting materials for bioelectrodes because of their attractive properties, such as their inherently high surface area, tubular structure, and electrocatalytic properties (Guiseppi-Elie et al. 2002), which allow for effective communication between the CNTs and redox proteins. In addition, carbon nanotubes approximate a redox active center, as for cytochrome-c (Davis et al. 1997DAVIS JJ, COLES RJ AND HILL HAO. 1997. Protein electrochemistry at carbon nanotube electrodes. J Electroanal Chem 440: 279-282., Wang et al. 2002aWANG G, XU JJ AND CHEN HY. 2002a. Interfacing cytochrome c to electrodes with a DNA - carbon nanotube composite film. Electrochem Commun 4: 506-509., b), and they also can be deeply embedded within a glycoprotein such as GOx (Guiseppi-Elie et al. 2002, Zhao et al. 2002ZHAO YD, ZHANG WD, CHEN H AND LUO QM. 2002. Direct electron transfer of glucose oxidase molecules adsorbed onto carbon nanotube powder microelectrode. Anal Sci 18: 939-941.). Another attractive property of carbon nanotubes is the possibility of aligning CNT assemblies on the electrode surface, wherein the length and the density of the assemblies can be controlled (Gooding et al. 2003GOODING JJ, WIBOWO R, LIU JQ, YANG WR, LOSIC D, ORBONS S, MEARNS FJ, SHAPTER JG AND HIBBERT DB. 2003. Protein electrochemistry using aligned carbon nanotube arrays. J Am Chem Soc 125: 9006-9007.). Graphene is another carbon nanomaterial that has been applied to enzymatic ET studies, and it has extraordinary electron transport properties (Li et al. 2008bLI XL, ZHANG GY, BAI XD, SUN XM, WANG XR, WANG E AND DAI HJ. 2008b. Highly conducting graphene sheets and Langmuir-Blodgett films. Nat Nanotechnol 3: 538-542., Zhang et al. 2005ZHANG YB, TAN YW, STORMER HL AND KIM P. 2005. Experimental observation of the quantum Hall effect and Berry’s phase in graphene. Nature 438: 201-204.) and a very high surface area (Li et al. 2008a). Graphene can promote ET in a matrix and facilitate the DET process between the redox center of protein and the electrode (Shan et al. 2009SHAN CS, YANG HF, SONG JF, HAN DX, IVASKA A AND NIU L. 2009. Direct electrochemistry of glucose oxidase and biosensing for glucose based on graphene. Anal Chem 81: 2378-2382., Kang et al. 2009KANG XH, WANG J, WU H, AKSAY IA, LIU J AND LIN YH. 2009. Glucose Oxidase-graphene-chitosan modified electrode for direct electrochemistry and glucose sensing. Biosens Bioelectron 25: 901-905.). Other strategies to improve the ET have been used, such as the modification of surface with polymers, the functionalization of the electrode surface, the use of redox mediators, and the use of mesoporous materials and composites. Conducting and redox polymers have been applied to bioelectrodes since the 1980s (Degani and Heller 1989DEGANI Y AND HELLER A. 1989. Electrical communication between redox centers of glucose oxidase and electrodes via electrostatically and covalently bound redox polymers. J Am Chem Soc 111: 2357-2358., Foulds and Lowe 1986FOULDS NC. AND LOWE CR. 1986. Enzyme entrapment in electrically conducting polymers - Immobilization of glucose oxidase in polypyrrole and its application in amperometric glucose sensors. J Soc Chem Faraday Trans 1(82): 1259-1264., 1988, Pandey 1988PANDEY PC. 1988. A new conducting polymer-coated glucose sensor. J Chem Soc Faraday Trans I 84: 2259-2265.) to improve the communication between the enzyme and electrode, thus resulting in fast ET. Redox mediators are used to promote effective ET because some oxidoreductases enzymes are not able to transfer electrons by themselves (Moehlenbrock and Minteer 2008MOEHLENBROCK MJ AND MINTEER SD. 2008. Extended lifetime biofuel cells. Chem Soc Rev 37: 1188-1196.). Furthermore, many low-molecular-weight redox active compounds have been used (Chaubey and Malhotra 2002CHAUBEY A AND MALHOTRA BD. 2002. Mediated biosensors. Biosens Bioelectron 17: 441-456.), such as methylene blue (McCord and Fridovich 1970), toluidine blue O (Boguslavsky et al. 1995BOGUSLAVSKY LI, GENG L KOVALEV IP, SAHNI SK, XU Z AND SKOTHEIM TA. 1995. Amperometric thin-film biosensors based on glucose dehydrogenase and toluidine blue O as catalyst for NADH electrooxidation. Biosens Bioelectron 10: 693-704.), and ferrocene (Jonsson et al. 1989JONSSON G, GORTON L AND PETTERSSON L. 1989. Mediated electron transfer from glucose oxidase at a ferrocene-modified graphite electrode. Electroanalysis 1: 49-55.). Some mesoporous materials have also been used to study ET and develop biosensors (Dai et al. 2004DAI ZH, LIU SQ, JU HX AND CHEN HY. 2004. Direct electron transfer and enzymatic activity of hemoglobin in a hexagonal mesoporous silica matrix. Biosens Bioelectron 19: 861-867.). Composites have been studied as a platform to enhance the performance of bioelectrodes, particularly nanocomposites have been utilized to improve the amperometric response of bio-relevant molecules such as dopamine, hydrogen peroxide, or NADH (Le Goff et al. 2011). The modification and functionalization of electrodes can improve the ET because these strategies result in the excellent adsorption of the enzyme on the electrode surface. In this context, the modification and functionalization of flexible carbon fibers (FCF) has been studied to prepare an optimal electrode for the investigation of bioelectrochemical processes (Martins et al. 2014MARTINS, MVA, PEREIRA AR, LUZ RAS, IOST RM AND CRESPILHO FN. 2014. Evidence of short-range electron transfer of a redox enzyme on graphene oxide electrodes. Phys Chem Chem Phys 16: 17426-17436., de Souza et al. 2016, Pereira et al. 2016PEREIRA AR, DE SOUZA JCP, IOST RM, SALES FCPF AND CRESPILHO FN. 2016. Application of carbon fibers to flexible enzyme electrodes. J Electroanal Chem 780: 396-406., Pereira et al. 2017a, Olyveira et al. 2012bOLYVEIRA GM, KIM JH, MARTINS MVA, IOST RM, CHAUDHARI KN, YU JS AND CRESPILHO FN. 2012b. Flexible carbon cloth electrode modified by hollow core-mesoporous shell carbon as a novel efficient bio-anode for biofuel cell. J Nanosci Nanotechnol 12: 356-360.). A high-performance GDh bioanode was developed by modifying an FCF array using acid treatment with H2SO4/HNO3, which resulted in the formation of nitrated carbon nanoblisters on the FCF surface, promoting the modification and functionalization of the electrode (de Souza et al. 2016), as shown in Figure 4. This modification provided a bioelectrode with unprecedented electrocatalytic performance. Another reported modification of FCF is their functionalization with quinone-like groups by chemical treatment with KMnO4/H2SO4 (Pereira et al. 2017aPEREIRA AR, DE SOUZA JCP, GONÇALVES AD, PAGNONCELLI KC AND CRESPILHO FN. 2017a. Bioelectrooxidation of ethanol using NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase on oxidized flexible carbon fiber arrays. J Bras Chem Soc 28: 1698-1707.). The quinones are well-known for their ability to catalyze the oxidation of NADH (Gorton and Dominguez 2002GORTON L AND DOMINGUEZ E. 2002. Electrocatalytic oxidation of NAD(P)H at mediator-modified electrodes. Rev Mol Biotechnol 82: 371-392., Katz et al. 1994KATZ E, LOTZBEYER T, SCHLERETH DD, SCHUHMANN W AND SCHMIDT HL. 1994. Electrocatalytic oxidation of reduced nicotinamide coenzymes at gold and platinum electrode surfaces modified with a monolayer of pyrroloquinoline quinone - effect of Ca2+cations. J Electroanal Chem 373: 189-200., Abdellaoui et al. 2016ABDELLAOUI S, MILTON RD, QUAH T AND MINTEER SD. 2016. NAD-dependent dehydrogenase bioelectrocatalysis: the ability of a naphthoquinone redox polymer to regenerate NAD. Chem Commun 52: 1147-1150.), allowing the improvement of the bioelectrocatalysis of NAD-dependent enzymes. ADH was immobilized on the pristine FCF and on the FCF functionalized with quinone-like groups, and the performances of the electrodes were compared using electrochemical measurements in the presence of several ethanol concentrations, as shown in Figure 5. As shown, after the modification of the FCF surface, there is an improvement in the bioelectrocatalysis, and the current densities increase around 10 times. This indicates that the modification of electrode surfaces could enhance the communication between the electrode and the enzyme. Besides the modification of the electrode surface, another possibility to improve the charge transfer is the modification of the protein structure. Mano and coauthors (Courjean et al. 2009COURJEAN O, GAO F AND MANO N. 2009. Deglycosylation of glucose oxidase for direct and efficient glucose electrooxidation on a glassy carbon electrode. Angew Chem Int Ed 48: 5897-5899., Prevoteau et al. 2010PREVOTEAU A, COURJEAN O AND MANO N. 2010. Deglycosylation of glucose oxidase to improve biosensors and biofuel cells. Electrochem Commun 12: 213-215.) showed that the deglycosylation of glycoproteins could be utilized to decrease the distance between the active center of an enzyme and the electrode surface, improving the DET. Deglycosylation corresponds to the cleavage of the glycans of the protein structure without changing the protein core (Courjean et al. 2009). The glycans are bonded to the protein backbone by glycosidic and amidic bonds, which could be cleaved by enzymatic or chemical routes. Thus, after this procedure, the enzyme could be utilized as the biocatalysts in solid electrodes with the active center closer to the surface, resulting in an increased faradaic current and improving the performance of the bioanodes in biofuel cells. Enzymatic procedures (Courjean et al. 2009COURJEAN O, GAO F AND MANO N. 2009. Deglycosylation of glucose oxidase for direct and efficient glucose electrooxidation on a glassy carbon electrode. Angew Chem Int Ed 48: 5897-5899.) for deglycosylation usually involve exoglycosidases and endoglycosidases. The last can be divided into three main groups: endo-D, H, and F, which are responsible for the portions linked by asparagine; endo-β-D-galactosidase, responsible for the hydrolysis of galactosidic bonds in some prosthetic groups; and the endoglycopeptidases, which are divided into N-glycosidases and O-glycosidases, which hydrolyze N-acetylglycosamineasparagine and N-acetylgalatosamineserine/threonine, respectively. Enzymatic routes allow for mild conditions, but they are specific for certain glycans. On the other hand, chemical methods (Patel et al. 1993PATEL T, BRUCE J, MERRY A, BIGGE C, WORMALD M, JAQUES A AND PAREKH R. 1993. Use of hydrazine to release in intact and unreduced form both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins. Biochemistry 32: 679-693., Dwek et al. 1993DWEK RA, EDGE CJ AND HARVEY DJ, WORMALD MR AND PAREKH RB. 1993. Analysis of glycoprotein-associated oligosaccharides. Annu Rev Biochem 62: 65-100., Edge et al. 1981EDGE ASB, FALTYNEK CR, HOF L, REICHERT JUNIOR LE AND WEBER P. 1981. Deglycosylation of glycoproteins by trifluormethanesulfonic acid. Anal Biochem 118: 131-137.) are not specific with respect to how the glycan is bonded to the protein. Moreover, they can remove all the glycans under appropriate reaction conditions. In this case, the reactants cleave the glycosidic bonds involving mainly neutral sugars. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) is a strong acid that has been utilized for the chemical deglycosylation of glycoproteins. This acid cleaves the glycosidic bonds, without changing the protein core, maintaining the enzyme activity (Edge et al. 1981). For example, for the deglycosylated horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a recombinant enzyme, it was showed a much higher rate of heterogeneous DET than for native one. In addition, the percentage of adsorbed enzyme molecules oriented for DET was increased compared to the wild-type HRP. The glycosylation could be considered as the reason for the absence of any electrochemical response of laccase from Coriolopsis fulvocinerea under anaerobic conditions; that is, it increases the distance of the electron tunneling between the laccase and conducting carbon (Shleev et al. 2005aSHLEEV S, JAROSZ-WILKOLAZKA A, KHALUNINA A, MOROZOVA O, YAROPOLOV A, RUZGAS T AND GORTON L. 2005a. Direct electron transfer reactions of laccases from different origins on carbon electrodes. Bioelectrochemistry 67: 115-124.). For GOx, a monolayer of the deglycosylated enzyme was immobilized on a vitreous carbon electrode, and it was observed that the electrooxidation of glucose started at -490 mV versus Ag/AgCl (Courjean et al. 2009). As shown in Figure 6a, the faradaic currents relative to the FAD/FADH2 cofactors inside both enzymes is much higher for the deglycosylated enzyme. By using the Laviron formalism (Laviron 1979LAVIRON E. 1979. General expression of the linear potential sweep voltammogram in the case of diffusionless electrochemical systems. J Electroanal Chem 101: 19-28.), the rate of electron transfer obtained for GOx was found to be 0.2 s-1, while this parameter corresponds to 1.58 s-1 for the deglycosylated enzyme, indicating that, after deglycosylation, the DET is improved. Another way to change the enzyme structure is to promote enzyme oligomerization because oligomers are more hydrophobic than native species, which improves the interaction of the enzyme with carbon electrode surfaces. Protein oligomerization can be considered as a type of protein aggregation, and it is dependent on several factors related to protein structure levels and the protein environment (Wang et al. 2010WANG W, NEMA S AND TEAGARDEN D. 2010. Protein aggregation - pathways and influencing factors. Int J Pharm 390: 89-99.). Because the environmental conditions can influence protein oligomerization, the pH and hydrophobicity are considered important parameters in determining protein aggregation rates. For instance, GOx has been oligomerized using a Brønsted acid (TFMS in this case), where the pH of the reaction mixture was drastically reduced, exposing the hydrophobic chains of the enzyme and stabilizing its structure; consequently, the catalytic activity was retained (Pereira et al. 2017bPEREIRA AR, LUZ RAS, DALMATI FCDA AND CRESPILHO FN. 2017b. Protein oligomerization based on Brønsted acid reaction. ACS Catal 7: 3082-3088.). This oligomerized enzyme is more hydrophobic than native GOx, which improves the adsorption of the enzyme on carbon surfaces, promoting an enhancement of DET, as shown in Figure 6b. In 1971, the term “enzyme immobilization” was coined by E. Katchalski-Katzi to designate “enzymes physically confined or localized in a certain defined region of space that retain their catalytic activity and can be used repeatedly and continuously” (Katchalskikatzir 1993KATCHALSKIKATZIR E. 1993. Immobilized enzymes - learning from past successes and failures. Trends Biotechnol. 11: 471-478.). The use of immobilized enzymes in industrial processes has been of great interest since the 1960’s because the anchoring of enzymes on a support facilitates the handling of the enzyme, solves the solubility problem of some enzymes, and minimizes or eliminates protein contamination of the product. In addition, the immobilization allows the recovery and reuse of the enzyme because of the facile separation of the biocatalyst from the product and the improvement in the enzyme stability (Klibanov 1979KLIBANOV AM. 1979. Enzyme stabilization by immobilization. Anal Biochem 93: 1-25.). The development of biodevices, such as biosensors, implantable biodevices, and biofuel cells, requires the immobilization of enzymes on electrode surfaces. Immobilized enzymes for bioelectrochemistry have several advantages, as in industrial applications. However, some drawbacks of this approach need to be considered, for example, difficult reproducibility, greater cost, and lower catalytic activity because of limitations in the mass transfer or conformational changes. The way that the protein is immobilized significantly affects the interactions between the electrode surface and the enzyme and the electrical communication with the redox site of the protein. Therefore, the performance of the immobilized enzyme depends on the enzyme and the method of anchoring. The most frequently used methods for enzyme immobilization are divided into five types: non-covalent adsorption, covalent bonding, entrapment, cross-linking, and affinity (Figure 7) (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511., Guisán 2006GUISÁN JM. 2006. Immobilization of enzymes and cells. New Jersey: Humana Press, 449 p.). The characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks are detailed in the following sections. Immobilization by adsorption is based on physical interactions, such as van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions between the support and the biomolecule (Jesionowski et al. 2014JESIONOWSKI T, ZDARTA J AND KRAJEWSKA B. 2014. Enzyme immobilization by adsorption: a review. Adsorption 20: 801-821.). The adsorption method involves placing the electrode in contact with the enzyme solution for a period or depositing the enzyme solution onto the electrode surface until the solvent evaporates. In both cases, the unadsorbed molecules are removed by washing the electrode with a buffer solution. The presence of defects on the electrode surface can improve the adsorption of enzymes, for example, defects can be easily obtained on FCF electrodes by chemical treatment with permanganate ions in sulfuric acid solution, which results in the exfoliation of the surface (Pereira et al. 2016PEREIRA AR, DE SOUZA JCP, IOST RM, SALES FCPF AND CRESPILHO FN. 2016. Application of carbon fibers to flexible enzyme electrodes. J Electroanal Chem 780: 396-406., 2017a, Martins et al. 2014MARTINS, MVA, PEREIRA AR, LUZ RAS, IOST RM AND CRESPILHO FN. 2014. Evidence of short-range electron transfer of a redox enzyme on graphene oxide electrodes. Phys Chem Chem Phys 16: 17426-17436.) or the treatment with sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which promotes the formation of nanoblisters on the FCF electrode surface (de Souza et al. 2016). In addition, other attractive techniques to immobilize enzyme by adsorption are layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) adsorption (Siqueira et al. 2010SIQUEIRA JR, CASELI L, CRESPILHO FN, ZUCOLOTTO V AND OLIVEIRA ON. 2010. Immobilization of biomolecules on nanostructured films for biosensing. Biosens Bioelectron 25: 1254-1263.). LbL is based on alternate electrostatic adsorption of layers of enzyme and an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (Iost and Crespilho 2012IOST RM AND CRESPILHO FN. 2012. Layer-by-layer self-assembly and electrochemistry: applications in biosensing and bioelectronics. Biosens Bioelectron 31: 1-10.). The charge of the protein is easily controlled by the pH of the solution, according to the isoelectric point of the biomolecule; that is, if the pH is higher than the isoelectric point, the enzyme is negatively charged. For immobilization by the LbL technique, the electrode is immersed in sequence into aqueous solutions containing the positively and negatively charged materials to be immobilized. This procedure is repeated until the desired number of layers is achieved. In contrast, the LB technique employs monolayers insoluble in water, and these LB films are transferred from the air/water interface onto electrode surface by vertical dipping into the aqueous solution. This procedure can be repeated several times to form multilayers (Iost et al. 2011b). The LbL and LB techniques have been employed for the construction of nanostructured films containing enzymes for different electrochemical applications, such as biosensing and bioelectronic devices (Iost and Crespilho 2012, Siqueira et al. 2010, Crespilho et al. 2006a, c, 2008, Iost et al. 2011b, Caseli et al. 2008CASELI L, CRESPILHO FN, NOBRE TM, ZANIQUELLI MED, ZUCOLOTTO V AND OLIVEIRA ON. 2008. Using phospholipid Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films as matrix for urease immobilization. J Colloid Interface Sci 319: 100-108.). The adsorption method is the simplest, easiest, and the most inexpensive method of enzyme immobilization onto solid surfaces. Furthermore, this method, generally, does not affect the active site of the enzyme, which contributes to the preservation of its electrocatalytic activity. However, because of the weak bonds involved, the enzyme molecules tend to leach from the electrode surface. The interactions between enzyme and electrode are destroyed by desorption forces, such as high ionic strength and pH. Another disadvantage is that this method is non-specific; thus, it results in the immobilization of other proteins and substrates (Cao and Schmid 2005CAO L AND SCHMID RD. 2005. Carrier-bound immobilized enzymes: principles, application and design. New Jersey: Wiley VCH, 578 p.). An important method of enzyme immobilization is covalent attachment because this kind of bond usually provides the strongest attachment between the enzyme and support compared to other types of enzyme immobilization, such as non-covalent adsorption. In this method, enzyme molecules are anchored to the electrode material by multiple covalent bonds between functional groups. To maintain the enzyme activity, the active site must not participate in covalent bonding. The reactive amino acid residues should be located on the enzyme surface because access to buried residues is restricted. The most common enzyme functional groups used for covalent immobilization are the amino groups of N-terminal amino acids and (ε)-amino groups of lysine residue (Cao and Schmid 2005CAO L AND SCHMID RD. 2005. Carrier-bound immobilized enzymes: principles, application and design. New Jersey: Wiley VCH, 578 p.); γ- and β-carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues and C-terminal carboxyl groups; the guanidinyl groups of arginine residues; the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues; the imidazolyl group of histidine residue; the thioether moiety of methionine residue. In addition, in the case of glycosylated enzymes, covalent bonds may be formed by the sugar residues. In particular, enzymes containing cysteine residue can be directly immobilized on gold electrodes by thiol bonds. The presence and the types of functional groups on the electrode surface are also important for covalent immobilization, and the most common functional groups are carboxylic acid groups and amino groups. The functional groups are activated by multifunctional reagents, for example, carbodiimide and glutaraldehyde. Carbodiimide can provide the linkage between amino groups of the protein and carboxylic acid groups of the electrode surface and vice versa (Figures 8a and 8b). Glutaraldehyde can be used to bond the amino groups of the support and the enzyme (Figure 8c) (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511.). The main advantage of enzyme immobilization by covalent bonding is that the protein molecules are strongly linked to the electrode surface, which prevents the enzyme leaching, with no diffusion barrier. Multiple covalent bonds promote the rigidification of the biomolecule, reducing the conformational flexibility and thermal vibrations. This can increase the enzyme stability and prevent enzyme denaturation by heat, organic solvents, and extreme pH (Mateo et al. 2007MATEO C, PALOMO JM, FERNANDEZ-LORENTE G, GUISAN JM AND FERNANDEZ-LAFUENTE R. 2007. Improvement of enzyme activity, stability and selectivity via immobilization techniques. Enzyme Microb Technol 40: 1451-1463.). However, the disadvantage of this immobilization method is that matrix cannot be re-used because of the irreversible attachment of the enzyme. Enzymes can be easily immobilized on electrodes via their inclusion in a polymer network, such as organic or inorganic polymeric matrices. Some examples of materials used for the entrapment of enzymes are Nafion, polyacrylamide, polypyrrole, chitosan, agarose, polyaniline, and silica sol-gel (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511., Klotzbach et al. 2008KLOTZBACH TL, WATT M, ANSARI Y AND MINTEER SD. 2008. Improving the microenvironment for enzyme immobilization at electrodes by hydrophobically modifying chitosan and Nafion polymers. J Membr Sci 311: 81-88.). The method of enzyme entrapment varies according to the polymer. In the case of Nafion, two methodologies have been successfully employed: (a) the casting of a Nafion suspension on enzymes anchored on the electrode surface, thereby trapping the enzyme between the electrode and the Nafion membrane after solvent evaporation (Pereira et al. 2017aPEREIRA AR, DE SOUZA JCP, GONÇALVES AD, PAGNONCELLI KC AND CRESPILHO FN. 2017a. Bioelectrooxidation of ethanol using NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase on oxidized flexible carbon fiber arrays. J Bras Chem Soc 28: 1698-1707., de Souza et al. 2016) and (b) the casting of a mixture containing Nafion and enzyme on the electrode surface (Klotzbach et al. 2008KLOTZBACH TL, WATT M, ANSARI Y AND MINTEER SD. 2008. Improving the microenvironment for enzyme immobilization at electrodes by hydrophobically modifying chitosan and Nafion polymers. J Membr Sci 311: 81-88.). A procedure to entrap enzymes in a chitosan network is similar to that of Nafion, that is, by casting enzyme/chitosan mixture on the electrode surface (Klotzbach et al. 2008, Lee and Tsai 2009LEE CA AND TSAI YC. 2009. Preparation of multiwalled carbon nanotube-chitosan-alcohol dehydrogenase nanobiocomposite for amperometric detection of ethanol. Sens Actuators B 138: 518-523.). To develop silica sol-gel-enzyme-based electrodes, silica gel can be mixed with the enzyme solution and then dropped onto the electrode surface (Reddaiah and Reddy 2014REDDAIAH K AND REDDY TM. 2014. Electrochemical biosensor based on silica sol-gel entrapment of horseradish peroxidase onto the carbon paste electrode toward the determination of 2-aminophenol in non-aqueous solvents: A voltammetric study. J Mol Liq 196: 77-85.). Alternatively, polypyrrole and polyaniline can be electropolymerized on the electrode surface by applying an appropriate potential or current to an electrode soaked in an aqueous solution containing the enzyme and monomer molecules. Thus, the polymer is formed on the electrode surface, and the enzyme molecules are physically incorporated into the growing polymer network (Cosnier et al. 2006COSNIER S, MOUSTY C, GONDRAN C AND LEPELLEC A. 2006. Entrapment of enzyme within organic and inorganic materials for biosensor applications: Comparative study. Mater Sci Eng C 26: 442-447.). By using the entrapment technique, several enzymes, mediators, and additives can be simultaneous immobilized within the same polymer. Furthermore, the protein activity is preserved, and the operational and storage stabilities are increased. In addition, the polymer network prevents the direct contact of the biocatalyst with the environment, which minimizes the effects of gas bubbles, mechanical stirring, and hydrophobic solvents. On the other hand, the main drawbacks of the entrapment immobilization method are enzyme leakage and mass transfer limitations caused by the polymer barrier (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511., Sheldon 2007SHELDON RA. 2007. Enzyme immobilization: The quest for optimum performance. Adv Synth Catal 349: 1289-1307.). Enzyme immobilization can also be performed by cross-linking protein molecules using a bifunctional chemical cross-linker (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511.). The most used reagent for this purpose is glutaraldehyde (Barbosa et al. 2014BARBOSA O, ORTIZ C, BERENGUER-MURCIA A, TORRES R, RODRIGUES RC AND FERNANDEZ-LAFUENTE R. 2014. Glutaraldehyde in bio-catalysts design: a useful crosslinker and a versatile tool in enzyme immobilization. RSC Adv 4: 1583-1600.). This dialdehyde reacts mainly with the primary amino groups of proteins; thus, the cross-linking of enzymes, either to a solid support or between protein molecules, generally implies the ε-amino group of lysine residues or N-terminal group of the protein chain. Eventually, the reaction proceeds with the nucleophilic functional groups of amino acid side-chains, such as other amines, thiol, phenol, and imidazole (Habeeb and Hiramoro 1968HABEEB AFS AND HIRAMORO R. 1968. Reaction of proteins with glutaraldehyde. Arch Biochem Biophys 126: 16-26.). Co-reticulation of the target enzyme with a functionally inert protein with a high density of superficial lysine residues, such as bovine serum albumin, is quite common for the development of bioelectrodes (Olyveira et al. 2012bOLYVEIRA GM, KIM JH, MARTINS MVA, IOST RM, CHAUDHARI KN, YU JS AND CRESPILHO FN. 2012b. Flexible carbon cloth electrode modified by hollow core-mesoporous shell carbon as a novel efficient bio-anode for biofuel cell. J Nanosci Nanotechnol 12: 356-360., Crespilho et al. 2009aCRESPILHO FN, ESTEVES MC, SUMODJO PTA, PODLAHA EJ AND ZUCOLOTTO V. 2009a. Development of highly selective enzymatic devices based on deposition of permselective membranes on aligned nanowires. J Phys Chem C 113: 6037-6041.). The reaction mechanism of glutaraldehyde with proteins can proceed by several mechanisms (Figure 9). This is because glutaraldehyde assumes different monomeric and polymeric conformations in aqueous solution, and each structure can react at different points of the protein chain (Barbosa et al. 2014BARBOSA O, ORTIZ C, BERENGUER-MURCIA A, TORRES R, RODRIGUES RC AND FERNANDEZ-LAFUENTE R. 2014. Glutaraldehyde in bio-catalysts design: a useful crosslinker and a versatile tool in enzyme immobilization. RSC Adv 4: 1583-1600.). This immobilization method is simple and provides a strong interaction between the biomolecules. The cross-linking method can be combined with other enzyme immobilization methods, for example, entrapment (Olyveira et al. 2012bOLYVEIRA GM, KIM JH, MARTINS MVA, IOST RM, CHAUDHARI KN, YU JS AND CRESPILHO FN. 2012b. Flexible carbon cloth electrode modified by hollow core-mesoporous shell carbon as a novel efficient bio-anode for biofuel cell. J Nanosci Nanotechnol 12: 356-360., Crespilho et al. 2009bCRESPILHO FN, IOST RM, TRAVAIN SA, OLIVEIRA ON AND ZUCOLOTTO V. 2009b. Enzyme immobilization on Ag nanoparticles/polyaniline nanocomposites. Biosens Bioelectron 24: 3073-3077.). However, cross-linking has some disadvantages, such as enzyme activity losses because of distortions in the protein conformation, poor reproducibility, and low mechanical stability (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511., Sheldon 2007SHELDON RA. 2007. Enzyme immobilization: The quest for optimum performance. Adv Synth Catal 349: 1289-1307.). Enzymes can be immobilized on the electrode surface by (bio)affinity bonds between a specific group of the protein and the support. For this, the electrode surface must be activated, for example with lectin, avidin, or metal chelates; alternatively, the protein must be conjugated with a compound with an affinity for the support (Guisán 2006GUISÁN JM. 2006. Immobilization of enzymes and cells. New Jersey: Humana Press, 449 p.). This method has the advantage that it provides controlled and oriented immobilization of the enzyme. However, in some cases, genetic engineering may be required for the production of tagged enzymes (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511., Datta et al. 2013DATTA S, CHRISTENA LR AND RAJARAM YRS. 2013. Enzyme immobilization: an overview on techniques and support materials. 3 Biotech 3: 1-9.). The electrode surface can be activated by transition metal cation chelates, for example, nitrilotriacetic acid and imidodiacetic acid. In this case, enzymes containing histidine residues can be strongly attached to the surface by the interaction of these residues with the chelates (Porath et al. 1975PORATH J, CARLSSON J, OLSSON I AND BELFRAGE G. 1975. Metal chelate affinity chromatography, a new approach to protein fractionation. Nature 258: 598-599.). A drawback of this technique is that, generally, few histidine residues are accessible on the enzyme surface. Thus, genetic engineering methods are needed to produce tagged enzymes with histidine at specific positions. Another strategy to immobilize enzymes by affinity bonds is to exploit the strong interaction between biotin and avidin or streptavidin. For this, the biotin is bound to the enzyme through lysine residues by the reaction with biotin-ester reagents; alternatively, the enzyme can be genetically biotinylated (Guisán 2006GUISÁN JM. 2006. Immobilization of enzymes and cells. New Jersey: Humana Press, 449 p.). In addition, carbohydrates present in the surface of glycoproteins can be employed in the immobilization. Carbohydrates have a high affinity for lectins, such as concanavalin A, which can be easily immobilized on the electrode surface. This kind of immobilization is reversible and has the great advantage of using tags that are naturally present in the enzyme and located in areas of easy accessibility and are not essential for biological activity (Sassolas et al. 2012SASSOLAS A, BLUM LJ AND LECA-BOUVIER BD. 2012. Immobilization strategies to develop enzymatic biosensors. Biotechnol Adv 30: 489-511., Andreescu and Marty 2006ANDREESCU S AND MARTY JL. 2006. Twenty years research in cholinesterase biosensors: From basic research to practical applications. Biomol Eng 23: 1-15.). Electrocatalyst accelerates the rate of chemical reaction, but, in this case, the reaction takes place on the surface of an electrode (Masa and Schuhmann 2016MASA J AND SCHUHMANN W. 2016. Electrocatalysis and bioelectrocatalysis - Distinction without a difference. Nano Energy 29: 466-475.). Electrocatalysis can also be defined as the enhancement in the electrochemical reaction rate provided by a species that is not consumed in the reaction, i.e., the electrocatalyst (Grubb 1963GRUBB WT. 1963. Catalysis, electrocatalysis, and hydrocarbon fuel cells. Nature 198: 883-884.). When the electrode material has sites that can adsorb the reagent, the probability of achieving an energetic situation that favors ET increases significantly. Thus, materials that have this property are called electrocatalysts (Bard and Faulkner 1980BARD AJ AND FAULKNER LR. 1980. Electrochemical methods: fundamentals and applications. New York: Wiley, 864 p.). Therefore, the performance of an electrocatalyst depends on the electronic structure of the atoms on the electrode surface (Hammer and Norskov 1995HAMMER B AND NORSKOV JK. 1995. Electronic factors determining the reactivity of metal surfaces. Surf Sci 343: 211-220., Hammer et al. 2000, Tersoff and Falicov 1981TERSOFF J AND FALICOV LM. 1981. Electronic structure and local atomic configurations of flat and stepped (111) surfaces of Ni and Cu. Phys Chem B 24: 754-764.), as well the chemical nature of the surface (Chen and McCreery 1996CHEN PH AND MCCREERY RL. 1996. Control of electron transfer kinetics at glassy carbon electrodes by specific surface modification. Anal Chem 68: 3958-3965.), its morphology, and crystal structure (Lebedeva et al. 2002LEBEDEVA NP, KOPER MTM, FELIU JM AND VAN SANTEN RA. 2002. Role of crystalline defects in electrocatalysis: Mechanism and kinetics of CO adlayer oxidation on stepped platinum electrodes. J Phys Chem B 106: 12938-12947.). An electrocatalytic cycle can be summarized by three typical steps (Masa and Schuhmann 2016): i) substrate transportation from the electrolyte bulk to the active site, ii) electrocatalytic reaction, and iii) product transportation from the catalyst surface. In step (ii), sub-reactions must be considered, which includes the substrate adsorption, ET, and product desorption. In bioelectrocatalysis, the electrocatalysts are biomolecules, e.g., whole cells or enzymes, in particular, the enzymes of the oxidoreductase group, which catalyze redox reactions (Ghindilis et al. 1997GHINDILIS AL, ATANASOV P AND WILKINS E. 1997. Enzyme-catalyzed direct electron transfer: Fundamentals and analytical applications. Electroanalysis 9: 661-674., May 1999MAY SW. 1999. Applications of oxidoreductases. Curr Opin Biotechnol 10: 370-375.), and the fundamental principles are the same as for electrocatalysis. Although there are different types of oxidoreductases, the oxidases and hydrogenases are worthy of attention because they catalyze the same kind of reaction, i.e., the catalytic reactions of these enzymes start from the same substrate and finish with the same product via distinct mechanisms (Ferri et al. 2011FERRI S, KOJIMA K AND SODE K. 2011. Review of glucose oxidases and glucose dehydrogenases: a bird´s eye view of glucose sensing enzymes. J Diabetes Sci Technol 5: 1068-1076.). For instance, both GDh and GOx produce gluconolactone, as shown by Equations 1 and 6, respectively. The oxidases transfer an electron to oxygen, while the dehydrogenases transfer electrons directly to an electron acceptor molecule (a coenzyme). For enzyme-modified electrodes, ET between the electrode surface and the redox center of the protein is dependent on the enzyme orientation, and of the localization of the enzyme active center, which must be located at a short distance from the electrode to allow the tunneling of the electron (Heller 1992HELLER A. 1992. Electrical connection of enzyme redox centers to electrodes. J Phys Chem 96: 3579-3587., Falk et al. 2012FALK M, BLUM Z AND SHLEEV S. 2012. Direct electron transfer based enzymatic fuel cells. Electrochim. Acta 82: 191-202.). Thus, the greatest challenge in bioelectrocatalysis is the development of an electrochemical interface that establishes electrical communication between the enzyme and the electrode surface (Bartlett 2008BARTLETT P. 2008. Bioelectrochemistry: fundamentals, experimental techniques and applications. New Jersey: J Wiley & Sons, 494 p.). The activity of an enzyme as a biological catalyst often depends on the protein structure (Zoungrana et al. 1997ZOUNGRANA T, FINDENEGG GH AND NORDE W. 1997. Structure, stability, and activity of adsorbed enzymes. J Colloid Interface Sci 190: 437-448.). In other situations, the presence of non-protein cofactors, such as metals for metalloenzymes or organic molecules as coenzymes (McCall et al. 2000), is required. In bioelectrocatalysis, the cofactors can serve as redox centers that exchange charge between the enzyme and electrode. Usually, the cofactors are located inside the protein structure and they have high selectivity and specificity (Masa and Schuhmann 2016MASA J AND SCHUHMANN W. 2016. Electrocatalysis and bioelectrocatalysis - Distinction without a difference. Nano Energy 29: 466-475.). Enzymes are a special group of molecular electrocatalysts (Hexter et al. 2014HEXTER SV, ESTERLE TF AND ARMSTRONG FA. 2014. A unified model for surface electrocatalysis based on observations with enzymes. Phys Chem Chem Phys 16: 11822-11833.), and they can be attached to the electrode by numerous weak interactions. Therefore, ET between the substrate and the electrode is possible if the enzyme is suitably orientated and the enzyme active site is located a short distance from the electrode, allowing electron tunneling (Heller 1992HELLER A. 1992. Electrical connection of enzyme redox centers to electrodes. J Phys Chem 96: 3579-3587., Falk et al. 2012FALK M, BLUM Z AND SHLEEV S. 2012. Direct electron transfer based enzymatic fuel cells. Electrochim. Acta 82: 191-202.). In electron tunneling in a biological process, the electrons can travel up to 14 Å between redox centers through the protein medium under physiological conditions (Page et al. 1999PAGE CC, MOSER CC, CHEN XX AND DUTTON PL. 1999. Natural engineering principles of electron tunnelling in biological oxidation-reduction. Nature 402: 47-52.); consequently, it is important that the redox centers be close to the electrode surface. In general, electrocatalysts are small molecules, such as the cobalt complex that catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction (Figure 10a) (McCrory et al. 2012); however, the enzymes usually utilized as biocatalysts have diameters around 100 Å (Figure 10b) (Hexter et al. 2014). Thus, in most cases, there is a large distance between the enzyme’s catalytic site and the protein surface, and at least one electron relay center is needed to ensure rapid intramolecular ET (as shown in Figure 10c). Fast interfacial ET between the electrode and the relay system is possible only if the enzyme makes good electronic contact with the electrode surface (Hexter et al. 2014). Figure 10d shows a pictorial model of bioelectrocatalysis, where the interfacial ET between the enzyme and the electrode is separated from the catalytic events. In other words, the bioelectrocatalysis process occurs in two steps. In comparison to conventional catalysts, enzymes have well-defined active sites, because they are formed of a transition metal ion as a part of the complex protein matrix. In this case, the electron densities of the redox centers are altered by the peptides and residual chemical groups present in the protein backbone to values matching the energy of substrates, allowing a faster conversion of the substrates (Masa and Schuhmann 2016MASA J AND SCHUHMANN W. 2016. Electrocatalysis and bioelectrocatalysis - Distinction without a difference. Nano Energy 29: 466-475.). Once that the fundamental principles of ET processes are understood, the interest in bioelectrochemistry has focused on the mechanism of ET and how it is linked to other physiological functions. For small biochemical systems, the voltammetric method is a common choice, providing insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of ET reactions. Moreover, these methods provide valuable information concerning the mechanisms and interactions of such biochemical systems (Gulaboski et al. 2012GULABOSKI R, MIRCESKI V, BOGESKI I AND HOTH M. 2012. Protein film voltammetry: electrochemical enzymatic spectroscopy. A review on recent progress. J Solid State Electrochem 16: 2315-2328.). However, for proteins, the utilization of voltammetry to understand their redox reactions is difficult because of the protein size and the presence of large lipophilic tails that prevent the transfer of electrons between the protein and the electrode. Because the active center are often bound to internal buried sites in the secondary structure of the enzymes, access by the electrodes is difficult, which implies a slow electron exchange with the electrodes (Armstrong 1990ARMSTRONG FA. 1990. Probing metalloproteins by voltammetry. Struct Bonding 72: 137-230.). Consequently, early biosensors and biofuel cells utilized mediators for electrons flow. However, mediation is not the ideal approach to study fundamentals of catalytic enzyme reactions because the influence of the enzyme and the enzyme substrate on the electrochemistry of the mediator must be considered. Thus, to facilitate DET between the enzyme and the electrode surface, some types of protein thin films at the electrode surfaces have been developed (Rusling and Zhang 2001RUSLING JF AND ZHANG Z. 2001. Thin films on electrodes for direct protein electron transfer. In: Nalwa RW (Ed), Handbook of surfaces and interfaces of materials. San Diego: Academic Press, p. 33-71.). A possible approach is so-called protein-film voltammetry (PFV) (Armstrong et al. 1997), which avoids mediation and allows the direct observation of the enzymatic ET, as well as its catalytic reaction. The concept of the PFV was developed by Fraser Armstrong and provides an important way to investigate how ET in proteins is coupled to chemical reactions, for instance, in catalysis. PFV involves co-adsorbing proteins with aminocyclitols and polymixins to give monolayers with highly reversible voltammetry utilizing an edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrode (Armstrong et al. 1997). This method solves problems such as the protein diffusion because the protein under investigation is adsorbed on the electrode, forming a stable film of enzyme molecules. The PFV approach represents a method for studying the fundamental electrochemical of enzyme redox chemistry. In this methodology, the protein is deposited on the electrode surface mainly by self-assembly from the aqueous electrolyte in which the protein is dissolved. Thus, the redox features of the adsorbed protein can be monitored by applying a controlled potential to the protein-modified electrode, that is, by using different voltammetric techniques (Gulaboski et al. 2012GULABOSKI R, MIRCESKI V, BOGESKI I AND HOTH M. 2012. Protein film voltammetry: electrochemical enzymatic spectroscopy. A review on recent progress. J Solid State Electrochem 16: 2315-2328.). Learning how to adsorb a protein in a native and active configuration on the electrode surface and understanding the voltammetric results on both a quantitative and qualitative level are two intrinsic challenges of PFV. Some factors make PFV an excellent technique to study the electrochemistry of different proteins. For example, the sample economy: the amount of sample required to form a monolayer is around 10-11 mol cm-2; the sensitivity of the method: the investigation of the reactions requires a small amount of the sample; and the rate of the reaction: the voltammetric waveform and current are not limited by diffusion (Armstrong 2002ARMSTRONG FA. 2002. Insights from protein film voltammetry into mechanisms of complex biological electron-transfer reactions. J Chem Soc Dalton Trans 5: 661-671.). Both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV) can be used as powerful methods for studying redox active enzymes and proteins (Liu et al. 2005LIU AH, WEI MD, HONMA I AND ZHOU HS. 2005. Direct electrochemistry of myoglobin in titanate nanotubes film. Anal Chem 77: 8068-8074., Reeves et al. 1993REEVES JH, SONG S AND BOWDEN EF. 1993. Application of square-wave voltammetry to strongly adsorbed quasi-reversible redox molecules. Anal Chem 65: 683-688., Jeuken et al. 2002JEUKEN LJC, JONES AK, CHAPMAN SK, CECCHINI G AND ARMSTRONG FA. 2002. Electron-transfer mechanisms through biological redox chains in multicenter enzymes. J Am Chem Soc 124: 5702-5713.), and SWV is complementary to CV. However, SWV discriminates against the charging current, extracting only the faradaic contribution of the electrochemical response. In addition, SWV can be applied for kinetic measurements because it is a fast voltammetric method. Further, this electrochemical technique is particularly attractive for the mechanistic, kinetic, and thermodynamic characterization of surface electrode processes, including those of proteins. By using sweep or cyclic voltammetry, a layer of molecules undergoing simple reversible ET gives a signal that consists of a pair of compact reduction and oxidation peaks, and the average value of these peaks gives the reduction potential, while their changes in shape and separation as the scan rate gives information on the ET kinetics (Armstrong 2002ARMSTRONG FA. 2002. Insights from protein film voltammetry into mechanisms of complex biological electron-transfer reactions. J Chem Soc Dalton Trans 5: 661-671.). As cited above, CV is the most popular method for the study of thin protein film electrochemistry. For reversible electrochemical reactions, the interconversions between oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme are fast, considering the time scale of the voltammogram. The ideal cyclic voltammogram must have symmetric oxidation and reduction peaks of equal heights and no oxidation-reduction peak separation (Bard and Faulkner 1980BARD AJ AND FAULKNER LR. 1980. Electrochemical methods: fundamentals and applications. New York: Wiley, 864 p.) The integration of the CV surface area provides the charge (Q), in coulombs involved in the process, allowing the determination of the total surface concentration (ΓT), in other words, the amount of the enzyme in the film (Equation 7). For films where the cyclic voltammograms are controlled by diffusion, the integral under the peak is not proportional to the surface concentration of electroactive centers in the film, and this occurs because only a fraction of the protein has been electrolyzed. In this case, the peak current for an n-electron reaction in a film is: Here, C is the bulk concentration of the substrate, D is the diffusion coefficient of the substrate, v is the kinematic viscosity of the solution, and ω is the electrode rotation rate. Icat in Equation 10 corresponds to the catalytic current for the enzyme reaction with the substrate, and the electrochemical form of the Michaelis-Menten Equation is (Sucheta et al. 1993SUCHETA A, CAMMACK R, WEINER J AND ARMSTRONG FA. 1993. Reversible voltammetry of fumarate reductase immobilized on an electrode surface. Biochemistry 32: 5455-5465.): Pulsed voltammetry can provide better sensitivity and resolution when compared to other voltammetric methods. For thin enzyme films, the square-wave voltammograms give a reversible ET with symmetric peaks resulting from subtraction of the currents measured at the end of each forward and reverse pulse. As CV, forward-reverse SWVs peaks are valuable for mechanistic analysis. However, using this method, there is no direct relation between the electroactive surface area and the integral under the curve; consequently, this parameter is better determined using CV. Marcus theory provides a more realistic description of enzyme thin-film voltammetry; however, using CV, the analysis methods are less accessible than that explained above. On the other hand, using SWV, Marcus theory can be applied. In this case, non-linear regression analysis of SWV data allows the estimation of reorganization energies and the ET rate constants (Rusling et al. 2008RUSLING JF, WANG B AND YUN S. 2008. Electrochemistry of redox enzymes. In: Bartlett P (Ed), Bioelectrochemistry: fundamentals, experimental techniques and applications. J Wiley & Sons, p. 39-85.). In addition, SWV with large amplitude pulses could be used to study more complex ET processes in multicenter enzymes with multiple redox centers (Jeuken et al. 2002JEUKEN LJC, JONES AK, CHAPMAN SK, CECCHINI G AND ARMSTRONG FA. 2002. Electron-transfer mechanisms through biological redox chains in multicenter enzymes. J Am Chem Soc 124: 5702-5713.). Bioelectrochemical methods combined with spectroscopic techniques can provide detailed information about the activity and rate of an enzymatic process and gain direct structural insight into functionally relevant states (Ash and Vincent 2016ASH PA AND VINCENT KA. 2016. Vibrational spectroscopic techniques for probing bioelectrochemical systems. Adv Biochem Eng/Biotechnol 158: 75-110.). Vincent’s group have studied metalloenzymes under direct electrochemical control by infrared (IR) spectroscopy (Healy et al. 2011HEALY AJ, REEVE HA AND VINCENT KA. 2011. Development of an infrared spectroscopic approach for studying metalloenzyme active site chemistry under direct electrochemical control. Faraday Discuss 148: 345-357., Grabarczyk et al. 2014GRABARCZYK DB, ASH PA AND VINCENT KA. 2014. Infrared spectroscopy provides insight into the role of dioxygen in the nitrosylation pathway of a [2Fe2S] cluster iron-sulfur protein. J Am Chem Soc 136: 11236-11239., Ash et al. 2015). This in situ spectroelectrochemistry with IR radiation is shown in Figure 11 and is based on attenuated total reflectance (ATR) measurements, where the working electrode, modified with the protein of interest, is placed above the ATR prism (Ash and Vincent 2016, Hidalgo et al. 2015HIDALGO R, ASH PA, HEALY AJ AND VINCENT KA. 2015. Infrared spectroscopy during electrocatalytic turnover reveals the Ni-L active site state during H2 oxidation by a NiFe hydrogenase. Angew Chem Int Ed 54: 7110-7113.). This makes it possible to carry spectroscopic analysis under precise electrochemical control. This technique has been used in the investigation of hydrogenases that have metallic active sites, such as [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases (Ash, et al. 2017a, b, Paengnakorn et al. 2017PAENGNAKORN P, ASH PA, SHAW S, DANYAL K, CHEN T, DEAN DR, SEEFELDT LC AND VINCENT KA. 2017. Infrared spectroscopy of the nitrogenase MoFe protein under electrochemical control: potential-triggered CO binding. Chem Sci 8: 1500-1505., Healy et al. 2013). In these cases, the shifts in the ν(CO) or ν(CN) vibrational bands are monitored, allowing the identification of short-lived intermediates, the diagnosis of redox-coupled structural changes, and the monitoring of side reactions. Furthermore, some potential-dependent changes can be observed in bands associated with dehydrogenase active site ligands. This spectroelectrochemical method has also been used to study a [MoFe] nitrogenase (Paengnakorn et al. 2017), demonstrating the versatility of this approach. Another vibrational spectroscopy technique for monitoring in situ bioelectrochemical systems is Raman spectroscopy, where surface enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to improve the signal (Silveira et al. 2015SILVEIRA CM, QUINTAS PO, MOURA I, MOURA JJG, HILDEBRANDT P, ALMEIDA MG AND TODOROVIC S. 2015. SERR spectroelectrochemical study of cytochrome cd1nitrite reductase co-immobilized with physiological redox partner cytochrome c552 on biocompatible metal electrodes. PLoS ONE 10: e0129940., Sezer et al. 2011SEZER M, FRIELINGSDORF S, MILLO D, HEIDARY N, UTESCH T, MROGINSKI MA, FRIEDRICH B, HILDEBRANDT P, ZEBGER I AND WEIDINGER IM. 2011. Role of the HoxZ Subunit in the Electron Transfer Pathway of the Membrane-Bound [NiFe]-Hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha Immobilized on Electrodes. J Phys Chem B 115: 10368-10374., Ly et al. 2011LY HK, SEZER M, WISITRUANGSAKUL N, FENG JJ, KRANICH A, MILLO D, WEIDINGER IM, ZEBGER I, MURGIDA DH AND HILDEBRANDT P. 2011. Surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy for probing transient interactions of proteins with biomimetic interfaces: electric field effects on structure, dynamics and function of cytochrome c. FEBS J 278: 1382-1390.). Electronic spectra have also been used in the study of bioelectrochemical reactions, for example, the UV-vis spectroelectrochemical technique was used in the evaluation of ferredoxin from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Wu et al. 2011WU SP, BELLEI M, MANSY SS, BATTISTUZZI G, SOLA M AND COWAN JA. 2011. Redox chemistry of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ferredoxin electron-transfer domain and influence of Cys to Ser substitutions. J Inorg Chem 105: 806-811.), where several electronic spectra at various applied potentials were obtained for this protein. Fluorescence spectroelectrochemistry is another method that is based on electronic transitions, and this technique was used for the simultaneous monitoring of the type-1 copper oxidation state and the nitrite turnover rate of a nitrite reductase (NiR) from Alcaligenes faecalis S-6 (Krzeminski et al. 2011KRZEMINSKI L, NDAMBA L, CANTERS GW, AARTSMA TJ, EVANS SD AND JEUKEN LJC. 2011. Spectroelectrochemical investigation of intramolecular and interfacial electron-transfer rates reveals differences between nitrite reductase at rest and during turnover. J Am Chem Soc 133: 15085-15093.). Fluorescence spectroelectrochemical methods were also applied in the study of azurin, involving the direct observation of both kinetic and thermodynamic dispersion in a protein film on an electrode surface at the molecular scale (Salverda et al. 2010SALVERDA JM, PATIL AV, MIZZON G, KUZNETSOVA S, ZAUNER G, AKKILIC N, CANTERS GW, DAVIS JJ, HEERING HA AND AARTSMA TJ. 2010. Fluorescent cyclic voltammetry of immobilized azurin: direct observation of thermodynamic and kinetic heterogeneity. Angew Chem Int Ed 49: 5776-5779.). This approach is based on redox-dependent absorbance changes, which can be monitored in the fluorescence domain by means of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor-acceptor pair, whereby the redox site is the energy acceptor and an externally linked dye label is the fluorescent donor (Krzeminski et al. 2011, Salverda et al. 2010). Lastly, another in situ technique is based on magnetic spectroscopy, where magnetic circular dichroism is used for the evaluation of the proteins with in situ control of electrochemical potential (Marritt et al. 2006MARRITT, SJ, VAN WONDEREN JH, CHEESMAN MR AND BUTT JN. 2006. Magnetic circular dichroism of hemoproteins with in situ control of electrochemical potential: “MOTTLE”. Anal Biochem 359: 79-83.). This methodology was utilized in the analysis of the redox behavior of the cytochrome-c, a hemoprotein. The technique was demonstrated to be a robust analytical tool for the determination of heme properties in multiheme enzymes (Marritt et al. 2006). The most recent techniques for studying bioelectrochemical processes, by using in situ techniques, are the differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) (de Souza et al. In Press) and potentiometric titrations combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (Artz et al. In Press). The DEMS technique was applied in the study of the bioelectro-oxidation of ethanol by ADH, and allows the concomitantly detection of the two substrates (NADH and acetaldehyde) by using electrochemical and mass spectrometric techniques on-line. This new technique can be useful for other redox enzymes when their products are gaseous or volatile. The scheme of DEMS setup and the bioelectrohemical cell are represented in figure 12a and 12b. This system is composed by a conventional electrochemical cell connected in a mass spectrometer and the bioelectrochemical cell had an FCF with immobilized ADH as working electrode, the electrical contact was provided by a gold ring and wire, and the working electrode is supported over a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane that allows only the passage of gaseous and volatile compounds. In addition to answer fundamental questions about the ET processes in biological systems involving macromolecules, whole cells, and membranes, bioelectrochemistry has a wide range of practical applications, such as in biosensors, immunoassays, energy conversion, wastewater treatment, and bioelectrosynthesis (Bartlett 2008BARTLETT P. 2008. Bioelectrochemistry: fundamentals, experimental techniques and applications. New Jersey: J Wiley & Sons, 494 p., Olyveira et al. 2012aOLYVEIRA GM, IOST RM, LUZ RAS AND CRESPILHO FN. 2012a. Biofuel cells: bioelectrochemistry applied to the generation of green electricity. In: de Souza FL and Leite ER (Eds), Nanoenergy.Berlin: Springer, p. 101-123.). As the present review addresses the bioelectrochemistry of enzymes, we will describe the main applications of enzymatic devices, such as biosensors and biofuel cells (BFCs). These biodevices have been successfully used in numerous areas, ranging from environmental monitoring to in vivo energy harvesting. Enzymatic biosensors are analytical devices that use enzymes to detect and/or quantify specific chemicals. The selective analysis provided by these devices is based on biochemical molecular recognition. Because of their specificity, portability, fast response, and low cost, enzymatic biosensors are present in many different fields, such as food quality control, the monitoring of industrial processes and pollutants, and biomedical analyses (Iost et al. 2011aIOST RM, DA SILVA WC, MADURRO JM, MADURRO AGB, FERREIRA LF AND CRESPILHO FN. 2011a. Electrochemical nano(bio)sensors: advances, diagnosis and monitoring of diseases. Front Biosci E3 663-689., Oliveira et al. 2014OLIVEIRA ON, IOST RM, SIQUEIRA JR, CRESPILHO FN AND CASELI L. 2014. Nanomaterials for diagnosis: challenges and applications in smart devices based on molecular recognition. ACS Appl Mater Interfaces 6: 14745-14766., Luz et al. 2013LUZ, RAS, IOST RM AND CRESPILHO FN. 2013. Nanomaterials for biosensors and implantable biodevices. New York: Springer.). A major application of biosensors is in blood glucose monitoring for the management of diabetes. Glucose biosensors are commercially available and account approximately 85% of the world market for biosensors. Most personal blood glucose monitors are based on disposable, screen-printed enzyme electrode strips. Each strip contains printed working and reference electrodes, where the working electrode coated with the necessary reagents (enzyme, mediator, stabilizer, surfactant, linking, and binding agents) are deposited in a dry form (Turner 2013TURNER APF. 2013. Biosensors: sense and sensibility. Chem Soc Rev 42: 3184-3196.). The first glucose enzyme electrode was reported in 1962 by Clark and Lyons. They used GOx, and the measurements were based on monitoring the consumed oxygen. As discussed, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone. In the presence of O2, the natural GOx electron acceptor, the oxidized form of the enzyme, GOx-FAD, is regenerated and oxygen and hydrogen peroxide are produced (Equation 6b). Glucose concentration can be indirectly determined by the amperometric monitoring of hydrogen peroxide. This product is easily oxidized to molecular oxygen at a platinum electrode, according to Equation 13, and glucose biosensors based on the measurement of hydrogen peroxide are known as first-generation biosensors (Wang 2008WANG J. 2008. Electrochemical glucose biosensors. Chem Rev 108: 814-825.). Although the measurement of the formed peroxide is simple, this kind of biosensor is subject to errors that are attributed to fluctuations in oxygen tension, the stoichiometric oxygen limit, and the presence of interferers in the blood (Wang 2008WANG J. 2008. Electrochemical glucose biosensors. Chem Rev 108: 814-825.). To overcome these problems, efforts have focused on the replacement of oxygen by nonphysiological electron acceptors, redox mediators, for second-generation glucose biosensors. Ferrocene derivatives, ferricyanide, conducting organic salts, quinones, transition-metal complexes, phenothiazines, and phenoxazines have all been used as redox mediators for GOx. Using mediators, glucose measurements become independent of oxygen pressure, and interfering reactions are minimized (Wang 2008). The most recent glucose biosensors based on GOx have eliminated redox mediators (third-generation glucose biosensors). In this case, the electrons are transferred directly from the redox site of the enzyme to the electrode at potentials very close to the redox potential of the enzyme. Thus, biosensors with high selectivity are obtained in a simpler and cleaner system (Wang 2008WANG J. 2008. Electrochemical glucose biosensors. Chem Rev 108: 814-825.). However, the development of GOx-based electrodes that involve DET and show high performance is not trivial and, usually, new electrode materials are required to enhance the enzyme-electrode electronic communication. Recently, the DET of GOx adsorbed on FCF electrodes modified with graphene oxide was reported. In this case, the authors demonstrated that the presence of graphene oxide at the enzyme/electrode interface decreases the distance between the FAD/FADH2 enzyme cofactor and the FCF surface (Figure 13) (Martins et al. 2014MARTINS, MVA, PEREIRA AR, LUZ RAS, IOST RM AND CRESPILHO FN. 2014. Evidence of short-range electron transfer of a redox enzyme on graphene oxide electrodes. Phys Chem Chem Phys 16: 17426-17436.). Another way to obtain a clear DET between GOx and the electrode and to improve the electrocatalytic response is by modifying the enzyme structure. For example, the controlled oligomerization of GOx by treatment with a Brønsted acid can be used to provide a more efficient biocatalyst (Pereira et al. 2017bPEREIRA AR, LUZ RAS, DALMATI FCDA AND CRESPILHO FN. 2017b. Protein oligomerization based on Brønsted acid reaction. ACS Catal 7: 3082-3088.). Current efforts concerning the development of glucose biosensors have focused on implantable biodevices. In vivo glucose monitoring can eliminate the inconvenience associated with standard finger-stick sampling. Moreover, an implanted glucose biosensor can provide continuous monitoring of glucose in real time and with high accuracy (Wang 2008WANG J. 2008. Electrochemical glucose biosensors. Chem Rev 108: 814-825.). The development of implantable biosensors requires biocompatible and miniaturized systems, and these characteristics can be easily achieved by using FCF-based electrodes. Iost et al. (2015IOST RM, SALES FCPF, MARTINS MVA, ALMEIDA MC AND CRESPILHO FN. 2015. Glucose biochip based on flexible carbon fiber electrodes: in vivo diabetes evaluation in rats. ChemElectroChem 2: 518-521.) reported an implantable biochip based on GOx and a neutral redox mediator immobilized on the surface of FCF (Figure 14). This material enables the biochip to be conveniently manipulated during insertion into the jugular vein of a living rat. The ability for in vivo glucose detection was evaluated with a normal concentration of glucose and with diabetic simulation. In this case, the biochip showed promise performance for future applications of implantable bioelectronics devices. Similar to fuel cells, BFCs are electrochemical devices that convert the free energy of a chemical reaction into electrical power for the purpose of doing work (Bartlett 2008BARTLETT P. 2008. Bioelectrochemistry: fundamentals, experimental techniques and applications. New Jersey: J Wiley & Sons, 494 p.). BFCs have been classified as either microbial-based and enzymatic fuel cells according to the location of the enzymes, which can be inside of microorganisms or outside of living cells. However, microbial-based biofuel cells are outside the scope of this review and will not be discussed here. Enzymes show remarkable advantages over conventional inorganic catalysts, such as biocompatibility. In addition, they are less expensive than precious metal catalysts and show higher efficiency, higher selectivity, and higher activity under mild conditions (room temperature and near-neutral pH). The selectivity of enzymes for some substrates can simplify the design of BFCs because the separation of fuel and oxidant by a membrane is not necessary. These features make enzymatic BFCs attractive alternatives to rechargeable batteries and traditional fuel cells. BFCs can be constructed by several different approaches. The advantage of enzymatic BFCs is the capability to produce biodevices much smaller than microbial cells of equivalent power. Furthermore, this type of cell allows operation closer to the redox potential of the enzyme (Ivnitski et al. 2006IVNITSKI D, BRANCH B, ATANASSOV P AND APBLETT C. 2006. Glucose oxidase anode for biofuel cell based on direct electron transfer. Electrochem Commun 8: 1204-1210.). Enzymatic BFCs utilize purified enzymes as catalysts for the oxidation or reduction of metabolites at the anode or the cathode, respectively (Cooney et al. 2008COONEY MJ, SVOBODA V, LAU C, MARTIN G AND MINTEER SD. 2008. Enzyme catalysed biofuel cells. Energy Environ Sci 1: 320-337.). The general operation of an enzymatic BFC consists of two separate redox reactions that occur at electrodes modified with enzymes and connected to an external circuit (Figure 15) (Luz et al. 2014LUZ RAS, PEREIRA AR, DE SOUZA JCP, SALES FCPF AND CRESPILHO FN. 2014. Enzyme biofuel cells: thermodynamics, kinetics and challenges in applicability. ChemElectroChem 1: 1751-1777.). However, the main limiting factor in these systems is the inefficient generation of current at the anode. The current densities at enzyme-functionalized anodes depends on the loading of the enzyme immobilized on the electrode per unit area and the rates of the two reactions; that is, the turnover of the substrate by the enzyme working at the anode and the transfer of electrons from the active sites of the enzyme to the electrode surface (Davis and Higson 2007DAVIS F AND HIGSON SPJ. 2007. Biofuel cells - Recent advances and applications. Biosens Bioelectron 22: 1224-1235.). In addition, the heterogeneous ET rate constant of the enzyme is influenced by the support material, immobilization method, and target working enzyme. Thus, the observed maximum current density is usually limited by the inefficient ET between the enzyme active sites and the electrode surface. For the efficient operation of an enzymatic BFC, some conditions must be satisfied: the enzyme should have high catalytic activity and stability, the anode should have a redox potential as negative as possible to achieve the maximum potential difference between the anode and the cathode, and, for bioelectrocatalysis, a suitable mediator and enzyme immobilization methodology for the efficient ET between the active center of the enzyme and the electrode surface must be found (Ivnitski et al. 2006IVNITSKI D, BRANCH B, ATANASSOV P AND APBLETT C. 2006. Glucose oxidase anode for biofuel cell based on direct electron transfer. Electrochem Commun 8: 1204-1210.). The first enzymatic BFC was reported in 1964 using GOx immobilized at the anode and glucose as the fuel (Yahiro et al. 1964YAHIRO AT, LEE SM AND KIMBLE DO. 1964. Bioelectrochemistry. I. Enzyme utilizing biofuel cell studies. Biochim Biophys Acta 88: 375-383.). Despite the advances in this type of cell, their performances in terms of power density, lifetime, and operational stability are still worse than those of chemical fuel cells. For many years, GOx has been utilized to develop powerful enzyme-based bioanodes, but their utilization brings some issues because it is necessary to use a membrane in a BFC with this enzyme because oxygen is present in the cathode compartment, which interferes with GOx (Sales et al. 2013SALES FCPF, IOST RM, MARTINS MVA, ALMEIDA MC AND CRESPILHO FN. 2013. An intravenous implantable glucose/dioxygen biofuel cell with modified flexible carbon fiber electrodes. Lab Chip 13: 468-474.). Thus, recently, some other enzymes have been utilized as the anodes of BFCs, such as GDh (de Souza et al. 2016) and ADH (Pereira et al. 2017aPEREIRA AR, DE SOUZA JCP, GONÇALVES AD, PAGNONCELLI KC AND CRESPILHO FN. 2017a. Bioelectrooxidation of ethanol using NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase on oxidized flexible carbon fiber arrays. J Bras Chem Soc 28: 1698-1707.). ADH is used to study the catalytic reversible interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones, while the GDh NAD+-dependent enzyme is advantageous because it is unaffected by the presence of molecular oxygen. Thus, a membrane dividing the cell into two chambers is not required; this is an important characteristic for implantable systems (Sales et al. 2013). In recent years, the development of enzymatic BFCs has resulted in biodevices operating in living organisms that use organic compounds available in the host organism as fuel, mainly glucose. BFCs have been implanted in fruits (Katz et al. 2001KATZ E, BUCKMANN AF. AND WILLNER I. 2001. Self-powered enzyme-based biosensors.

J Am Chem Soc 123: 8630-8631.), rats (Cinquin et al. 2010CINQUIN P ET AL. 2010. A glucose biofuel cell implanted in rats. PLoS One 5: e10476., Zebda et al. 2013ZEBDA A ET AL. 2013.

Enzymatic biofuel cells designed for direct power generation from biofluids in living organisms. Energy Environ Sci 4: 5008-5012.), cockroaches (Rasmussen et al. 2012RASMUSSEN M, RITZMANN RE, LEE I, POLLACK AJ AND SCHERSON D. 2012. An implantable biofuel cell for a live insect. J Am Chem Soc 134: 1458-1460.), snails (Halamkova et al. 2012HALAMKOVA L, HALAMEK J, BOCHAROVA V, SZCZUPAK A, ALFONTA L AND KATZ E. 2012. Implanted biofuel cell operating in a living snail. J Am Chem Soc 134: 5040-5043.), clams (Szczupak et al. 2012SZCZUPAK A, HALAMEK J, HALAMKOVA L, BOCHAROVA V, ALFONTA L AND KATZ E. 2012. Living battery - biofuel cells operating in vivo in clams. Energy Environ Sci 5: 8891-8895.), and lobsters (MacVittie et al. 2013). Enzymatic BFCs implanted in small animals could contain wireless transmitting devices for military, industrial, and environmental monitoring (MacVittie et al. 2015). In mammals, these implantable biodevices have biomedical applications, such as the supply of power to cardiac pacemakers and artificial organs (Falk et al. 2013FALK M, VILLARRUBIA CWN, BABANOVA S, ATANASSOV P AND SHLEEV S. 2013. Biofuel cells for biomedical applications: colonizing the animal kingdom. ChemPhysChem 14: 2045-2058.). In this review, we have addressed the main theoretical and practical aspects of the bioelectrochemistry of redox proteins. The advances in enzyme catalysis in films and the development of new materials, such as metal nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, flexible carbon fibers, and graphene, have improved the protein-electrode interactions and allowed the study of electron transfer and the bioelectrocatalytic mechanisms of several enzymes directly. The development of new methodologies and in situ techniques have allowed us to obtain molecular-level detail, which has contributed to the elucidation of fundamental aspects of electron transfer in biomolecules and bioelectrocatalytic mechanisms. Moreover, these developments, combined with constant efforts toward the improvement in the performance, stability, biocompatibility, and miniaturization of bioelectrochemical systems, have contributed to the development of biodevices for biosensing and energy conversion. Therefore, future developments in bioelectrochemistry depend on its integration with other areas, such as nanotechnology, solid state physics, surface chemistry, bioengineering, biology, medicine, and electrical engineering, to elucidate other theoretical issues and increase practical applications.

why do tokyo and kyoto have the same letters,"['Possibilities are tremendous but task is daunting…this is what I feel…but not our PM. I visited Varanasi some 20 years ago but memories have come alive while watching PM in Japan. As I know Varanasi, the city of Kashi Vishwanath temple, Dhashdhmedh Ghat, Manikarnika Ghat, BHU, IIT, Sarnath, Five – Star Hotels, Tourists, Gangaji ki Aarti…it has tremendous potential as a tourist destination but for its infrastructure. Now that it has caught attention of our PM, it cannot escape transformation. PM’s main agenda of this visit to Japan. So what are the similarities, what are the differences, what are the opportunities and what are the threats? For this, it is important to know how splendid is Japanese city Kyoto. Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Osaka on August 30 and, within hours, oversaw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe to turn Varanasi into a ‘smart city’ with help from Kyoto. The pact is in line with Modi’s vision of building 100 ‘smart cities’ across India. Under the smart heritage cities programme, Kyoto will provide cooperation in the fields of conservation and modernisation of cities, as well as art, culture and academics. While Kyoto and Kashi share many similarities historically, there is a wide gap in where they stand today. First, the similarities: Kyoto is called the city of ten thousand shrines, while Varanasi boasts of numerous temples and ghats. Kyoto has been the imperial capital of Japan for more than 1,000 years, while Varanasi is considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Both cities also have rivers flowing alongside them. Now, the differences: Kyoto has modernised while keeping its old city, temples and monuments alive, while Varanasi has languished in its past glory. Kyoto’s streets are wide and clean, with magnificent tree-lined boulevards — something Modi witnessed on his way to the luxurious Westin hotel. Varanasi’s squalor and narrow roads have prompted the PM to resolve to clean up the city. Varanasi’s Ganga river is polluted and the ghats need repair, while Kyoto has a number of rivers, canals and other navigable waterways. While Yodo, Kamogawa and Katsura rivers flow through Kyoto, its Late Biwa canal is a major infrastructure milestone. These differences are likely to be highlighted by Kyoto’s mayor Daisaku Kadokawa in his a presentation to Modi on the subject. Modi’s plan of 100 ‘smart cities’ is one of the major focus areas during the visit. The Prime Minister is keen on rejuvenating Indian cities as urban centres, and Kyoto is a magnificent example of how a city preserves its cultural heritage while modernising itself. It, therefore, dovetails into PM’s own emphasis on rejuvenation of cities in India while preserving their cultural heritage as also his focus on what is widely known as ‘smart cities’. Kyoto, in the Japanese lexicon, is known as a smart city which is environmentally friendly, which preserves its heritage and which is at the cutting-edge of technology. Could you see some parallels between Kyoto and Varanasi? Yes we can ancient history, culture, heritage, holiness, temples, art & craft, rivers, Ghats, Education and IT Hub, food and cuisine. No wonder Modiji has chosen Japan to do the job of transforming on the lines of Kyoto. I thought of sharing history and present of Kyoto city of Japan on which Varanasi’s transformation has been modelled, traditional, cultural yet modern. Indeed the task is humongous, but worth trying. Probably it will be the most challenging task for Japan…but Japanese love challenges! Let me share with you, what is the challenge is all about. How did this elaborate transformation happened? What it will take to transform Varanasi? The city suffered extensive destruction in the Ōnin War of 1467-1477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. Battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve the court nobility (kuge) and religious factions as well. Nobles’ mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since. There was some consideration by the United States of targeting Kyoto with an atomic bomb at the end of World War II because, as an intellectual center of Japan, it had a population “better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon.” In the end, at the insistence of Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by Nagasaki. As a result, the Imperial City (Emeritus), of Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as machiya. However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the Kyōto Station complex. Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. Kyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, with a height just above 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) above sea level. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the Ujigawa to the south, the Katsuragawa to the west, and the Kamogawa to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in the prefecture with an area of 827.9 square kilometres (319.7 sq mi). The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang’an (present-day Xi’an). The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Ukyō (the right sector of the capital) being on the west while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Nakagyō, Shimogyō, and Kamigyō-ku still follow a grid pattern. Today, the main business district is located to the south of the old Imperial Palace, with the less-populated northern area retaining a far greener feel. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names. Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate. With its 2000 religious places- 1600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrinesas well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact, it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: The Kyoto Gyoen area including the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sento Imperial Palace, homes of the Emperors of Japan for many centuries; Katsura Imperial Villa, one of the nation’s finest architectural treasures; and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa, one of its best Japanese gardens. In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from Shijō to Kōmei. Other sites in Kyoto include Arashiyama, the Gion and Pontochō geisha quarters, the Philosopher’s Walk, and the canals which line some of the older streets. Traditional Japanese crafts are also major industry of Kyoto, most of which are run by artisans in small plants. Kyoto’s kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Such businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as sales of traditional goods stagnate. Kyoto Station is the center for transportation in the city. The second-largest in Japan, it houses a shopping mall, hotel, movie theater, Isetan department store, and several local government facilities all under one fifteen-story roof. We don’t give little old Europe enough credit. Packed into a comparably small space to that of the rest of the world, it has pretty much got everything covered. From beaches to glaciers, our little continent has plenty to offer those unable to trot across the globe. So for every iconic picture you see of some Caribbean coastline or Himalayan mountain range, just remember that there might be an equally bucket list worthy alternative right on your doorstep (or indeed a budget airline flight away).\xa0 Plan your trip on skyscanner.com but not before comparing two identicals so that you get the levy towards finanlising your budget and make headway towards your journey. Mexico’s beaches vs. Greece’s beaches Many people dream of visiting one of Mexico’s beaches, to drink Mojitos and soak up the sun, but if you’re not able to make the 10 hour flight then a great alternative has to be Greece – one of the best countries for a full-proof beach holiday. Some of the most spectacular have to be in Zante, their white sands and clear waters make them a popular sunbathing spot. Australia’s coastline vs. Portugal’s Algarve Australia’s Twelve Apostles limestone stacks in Victoria are incredible, but Portugal’s Praia da Marinha also packs a punch. The famous Algarve beach is surrounded by crooked rocks and cliffs and has many coves and caves to explore. Mongolian Desert vs. Gran Canaria The Gobi desert is a fascinating place – there really is something romantic about the idea of setting forth into the wilderness to experience the isolation of this inhospitable environment, with only a camel as your companion. However, you can still experience a desert adventure while on your holidays in the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. Lying on the same latitude as the Sahara, it’s no surprise that the south of the island has some impressive sand dunes… and yes, you can still visit them by camel. Chile’s glaciers vs. Iceland’s glaciers If this is something on your bucket list, maybe think about saving up for it sooner rather than later. Patagonia’s San Rafael Glacier is melting fast and experts estimate that it will have completely disappeared by 2030. BUT, if you don’t make it across the world in time, Iceland has some of the world’s most incredible ice structures – it’s in the name I guess. Glacier walks are a popular day trip for many tourists (Icelandic Mountain Guides offer a variety of tours) and chances are you might get to tick ‘seeing the northern lights’ off your list too. Many head to Thailand to island hop around some of Southeast Asia’s most beautiful islands. However, in Europe there are plenty of opportunities to do the same. If you don’t fancy going so far away, Italy has many islands from large, popular ones such as Sardinia and Sicily to many more remote ones such as the Pelagi islands, two of which are completely unpopulated. You will still be able to enjoy fantastic weather and gorgeous scenery – without the long-haul flight. Thai lakes vs. Croatian lakes The likes of Cheow Lan Lake in Khao Sok National Park are enough to make anyone hop on a plane to Thailand but Croatia’s Plitvice Lakes’ rushing waterfalls and lush surrounding forests make it an equally popular place to visit – and justifiably so. New Zealand’s mountain ranges vs. Italian mountain ranges New Zealand is the ultimate adventure destination. It’s sprawling mountain ranges make it top of many avid hiker’s travel wish-list, wishing to tackle one of the nine ‘Great Hikes’ and witness some spectacular scenery at the same time. If your budget doesn’t allow you an around the world ticket, Italy’s Alps, Dolomites and Appennino mountain ranges still allow the trepid explorer to lace up their hiking boots and explore the rocky terrain. Nepal’s Mountains vs. Swiss Alps Nepal has Everest. And seven other mountains that are among the top ten in the world. Fair enough. Keep them on your to do list. Europe’s mountains may not be able to compete in height, but they certainly can in scenery. The snow covered Swiss Alps for example, are unbelievably beautiful and are a rewarding hike for anyone willing and able to tackle them. Indonesia’s volcanoes vs. Canary Islands’ volcanoes Many travel to Indonesia to stand face to face with some of the earth’s most violent and active volcanos. There are over 120 here that frequently erupt, making Indonesia the most geographically unstable country in the world. If you fancy your tumultuous volcanic activity in a slightly smaller, and closer to home scale, the Canary Islands have a chain of seven across the islands. Mount Teide in Tenerife boasts the title of being the highest peek in Spain and the third biggest volcano on earth. Surely that’s worth a visit? Courtesy: Skyscanner.com Bali has been a dream destination for me, I have always yearned to visit Bali for some reason since 1995 (since my marriage) but that was not to be. The history, the culture, the beaches, the temples, the wild-life, the waterfalls and the shopping has always fascinated me in Bali. It is a complete package for the wanderer, adventurer, worshipper and shopper in me. I am planning my second honeymoon to Bali with the help of skyscanner.com. I started my search for the cheap flight as I am based out of Mumbai and need to fly to Bali, Indonesia. After filling the dates of travel and destination details, I had a host of options before me of flights offering very competitive rates. I zeroed in for Malaysian Air flight to fly on October 24th and return on October 30th, 2014. The price of ticket is unbelievable…at just Rs. 34,000 approx. considering the fact that I have only Rs. One Lakh for my entire trip. The price of ticket was indeed a big motivation for moving ahead with my travel plans… …Now I instructed my Gini (Skyscanner.co.in) to get me a good hotel which is in my budget and provide me some exquisite experience at the same time. Giving my fetish for good hotels and that too at a good price, I thought it will be difficult for Gini, but Lo & behold! I had host of hotels, resorts and places of stay at my disposal. I started looking at them one by one, now it was my turn to be confused. So I began the daunting task of screening the hotels, but on Skyscanner this journey was smooth beyond my imagination. The hotels listed had all the details including price details. In no time, I zeroed in to a hotel which looked quite impressive and was in my budget too…& that was Garden View Cottage, in Ubud which is located in the cool lush Central Highlands of Bali famed for its arts and crafts. Just south of Ubud, buffered by the Monkey Forest Sanctuary in the enchanting village of Nyuh Kuning Garden View looks like a haven of peace and harmony. Surrounded by shimmering fields edged by greenful gardens and home of refreshing “Mango Blue” Swimming pool looks like ‘the’ place for my stay in Bali. The package cost was unbelievable, Rs. 26,000 for entire six days, what a deal – incredible! I am delighted to the core. Though a true-blue Mumbaikar, and a regular user of public transport, I don’t use public transport ever for any of my trips, as venture out for the much needed break from using public transport. Now it was time for me to check on Car rentals which I find most expensive part in any trip be it in India or abroad. This will cost me around Rs. 6000 maximum, this way it accommodates my husband’s flight ticket too and big budget for shopping for my home and my darling daughter Tanyaa and her host of sisters & friends.

A truly Malaysian cultural journey through a tropical, hilly and demanding terrain…read complete account here before setting out for this adventure in Langkawi, Malaysia. It is a sporty and adventurous year for Malaysia. The country hosted the Ironman 70.3 Putrajaya version in April this year and will be holding the Ironman Malaysia in Langkawi on September 27, 2014. The event is presented by a collaboration of World Triathlon Council. Ironman Malaysia is one of 32 qualifying races on the global Ironman circuit that culminates with the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii each October. Professional athletes will be competing for a total prize of US$40,000 (RM127, 000) for Ironman Malaysia. “Ironman Malaysia is a great platform for athletes to showcase their talent and energy. Malaysia, especially Langkawi, being an ideal location for adventure sports as well as scenic beauty is an idyllic venue for Ironman Malaysia,” says, Mr. Manoharan Periasamy, Director, Tourism Malaysia, India. The name “Ironman Triathlon” is also associated with the original Ironman triathlon which is now the Ironman World Championship. Held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, the world championship has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978 and is preceded by a series of qualifying Ironman events. Ironman World Championships has become known for its gruelling length, harsh race conditions, and Emmy Award winning television coverage. Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board, popularly known as Tourism Malaysia, was established to promote Malaysia as a top-of-mind tourist destination showcasing Malaysia’s unique wonders, attractions and cultures; develop domestic tourism and enhance Malaysia’s share of the market for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE). Tourism Malaysia’s objective is to promote Malaysia as an outstanding tourist destination and make the tourism industry a major contributor to the socio-economic development of the nation. In India, Tourism Malaysia offices are conveniently located in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. In 2014, Malaysia celebrates its fourth VISIT MALAYSIA YEAR (VMY) with the theme “Celebrating 1Malaysia Truly Asia”. The VMY 2014 promotional campaign has started this year with a series of year-long special events and activities leading to VMY 2014. It will contribute to the Government’s target to receive 36 million tourist arrivals and RM168 billion in receipts by 2020, as outlined in the Malaysia Tourism Transformation Plan (MTTP) 2020. Lincoln Memorial, Washington D.C. – The Lincoln Memorial not only celebrates the life of the 16th president through a striking structure and interactive museum, but also carries his message of peace following the devastation of the Civil War. The words of his second inaugural address, carved into marble on the walls of the monument, would be a worthwhile plea to any of today’s war zones: “With malice toward none; with charity for all … let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan – to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nation” USS Missouri, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii – A battleship seems like an odd place to celebrate peace, but it was on the deck of the USS Missouri where the Japanese and Allies signed the peace treaty to end World War II on Sept. 2, 1945. Now docked in Pearl Harbor, where the war began for the U.S., the massive USS Missouri is open for guided tours of the inner workings of the ship, its history, and the very spot where the war formally ended. As Gen. Douglas MacArthur said at the time, “Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve it always. These proceedings are closed!” Amsterdam Hilton, Netherlands – On a lighter note, John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s ” bed-in for peace ” took place in a suite at the Amsterdam Hilton in 1969. Part of their year was immortalized in the song ” Ballad of John and Yoko .” Their protest/performance art project certainly didn’t end the war in Vietnam or anyplace else, but it was a noteworthy effort. You can actually stay in the same suite they used, now updated and full of Beatles memorabilia and a nice sound system, where you can put John’s “Give Peace a Chance” on auto-play. If you can’t make it to Amsterdam, you can also stay in the suite in Montreal’s Fairmont. The Queen Elizabeth where John and Yoko staged a second “bed-in” and wrote and recorded peace anthem. The Wall for Peace, Paris – This relatively unknown monument to peace sits in Champs des Mars within view of the Eiffel Tower. The 50-foot long, 30-foot high wall of steel and etched glass contains the word “peace” inscribed in 32 languages in its translucent surface. Inspired by the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the Wall for Peace also has a series of nooks where visitors can place their own messages of peace. Originally meant to be installed for just a three-month exhibit, the wall has stood in the park since 2000, showing that even here in a park dedicated to the god of war, peace has some staying power. Hiroshima Peace Memorial, Japan – Suffering the devastation of an atomic attack tends to make one focused on peace, and this moving memorial near ground zero of the August 1945 bombing is a scenic and thought-provoking spot. The stark steel-and-concrete skeleton of the Genbaku Dome was one of the few structures left standing after the bombing, and it has been preserved and converted into a museum surrounded by cherry tree-filled Peace Memorial Park . The museum’s exhibits displaying the horrors of war finish with a wall of messages for peace from the humble, the famous, and the famously humble Mother Theresa, who wrote, “Let us love one another … so that the terrible evil that had brought so much suffering to Hiroshima may never happen again.” The Peace Palace, The Hague, Netherlands – Funded by American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and constructed in 1912, the Peace Palace was inspired by The Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907. The conferences were meant to promote world peace and reduce the savagery of war. It didn’t work, as World War I began in Belgium a year after the palace was dedicated. But the war ended, and the palace still remains, now housing the International Court of Justice (which tries war criminals), the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the Peace Palace Library. They’re trying. The scenic grounds of the palace host temporary and permanent peace exhibits, and The Hague (“International City of Peace and Justice”) has citywide celebrations to commemorate the United Nations Peace Day on September 21. National Peacekeeping Monument, Ottawa, Canada – Only in polite Canada could you have a national monument dedicated to “reconciliation.” The Peacekeeping Monument, across from the Peace Tower in the capital complex in Ottawa, commemorates the service of more than 110,000 Canadians who have been part of United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world. It includes a quote by former Canadian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Lester Pearson (whose government also introduced universal health care and abolished the death penalty): “We need action not only to end the fighting, but to make the peace.” Palace of Versailles, France -The 1919 Treaty of Versailles has been blamed as a root cause for World War II as well as for the current mess in the Middle East, but it at least did formally mark the end of World War I, granting at least a temporary peace to a weary continent. Visitors to Versailles can now walk through the Hall of Mirrors , where politicians from around the world gathered for the ceremony, and see the Louis XV desk where the document was signed. Even amid heavy summer crowds of visitors to Versailles, you can still find some peace and quiet walking through the palace’s extensive gardens. The beautiful thing about Scotland (other than the scenery of course) is that it is so small that most things are within driving (or boating) distance. So, whether you are planning a road trip around the country, or just fancy a break from the city, there are plenty of opportunities to see some gorgeous views. Skyscanner reveal 11 of the most beautiful places in Scotland. Travelknots highly recommend Road trips by Skyscanner.com. Courtesy: Skyscanner.com Red Fort is witness to the dawn of August 15, 1947 when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, First PM of Independent India made the historical speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Delhi and since then it has been the permanent venue for the big speech i.e. Independence day address to citizens of free India. The Red Fort stood for the sovereign authority of the Mughal badshah, even when actual control of the territories had passed to others. For independent India, the Red Fort came to epitomise the sovereignty of Delhi and, by extension, the unity of India. The Red Fort is an iconic symbol of India. On Independence Day, the prime minister hoists the national flag at the main gate of the fort and delivers a nationally-broadcast speech from its ramparts. This year’s Independence Day evoked the keen interest not only amongst Indian citizens but Indians all over the world, head of states, diplomats…alike! After all it was first address of newly elected Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi from ramparts of Red Fort on August 15, 2014. Excitement was palpable amidst people who had gathered at Red Fort to get the glimpse of Tri Colour unfurled by Mr Modi and his eagerly awaited speech. Not just India but the whole world was keen to know the mind of the first Indian PM born after Indian independence. This was reflected by the fact that the MEA was pleasantly surprised as it was inundated by requests for passes from an unprecedented large number of Heads of Foreign Missions posted in Delhi. Normally, out of the 153 Foreign Missions in New Delhi, just about 50-60 Missions approach the MEA for passes to attend the Independence Day ceremony at Red Fort. But this time the MEA received requests for passes from a record number 150 diplomatic missions. Given the enormous interest shown by foreign diplomatic missions, the MEA had to stretch itself further and made arrangements for simultaneous English translation for the benefit of the foreign diplomatic corps, yet another first. Yet, there was one facet of national life that has defied the intrusions of the new Republic: Popular memory. Despite many attempts to impose some order into India’s myriad past, there remains a fundamental gulf between ‘history’ and memory. The sanitised version sees Independence as a seamless journey from darkness to light. But that’s not how most Indians recall narrations of the past by grandparents and elders. & thus making the Red Fort even more significant. Anybody who has been to Delhi or has lived in Delhi has not missed an opportunity to visit Red Fort and I am sure has great memories attached to his visit. Besides political significance which Red Fort enjoys, it has special significance as historical monument, UNESCO heritage site and tourist destination. It has been a mute witness to various political and historical event which unfurled in Delhi. The Red Fort was the residence of the Mughal emperors of India for nearly 200 years, until 1857. It is located in the centre of Delhi and houses a number of museums. In addition to accommodating the emperors and their households, it was the ceremonial and political centre of Mughal government and the setting for events critically impacting the region. Undoubtedly it has great significance for tourists visiting Delhi not just from India but across the globe to visit Red Fort which stands on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road, close to Jama Masjid and extends upto Chandani Chowk. It is famous for its light and sound show which is being held at 7:30 3every evening and is a big draw amidst tourists. The long and short of story is that we all love visiting Red Fort – Old generations, New generations. It is a must visit on our itinery. I have some very special memories attached to it when I used to go there for Independence Day celebration with my father to watch Mrs. Indira Gandhi, PM of India who exuded great power then, what a delight it was to watch her speech from ramparts of Red Fort. Not only this, after this we would move to Nai Sarak to pick up some lovely second hand books which I loved to read. Cherish memories of my father who is no more…and his frequent visits to Red Fort on some pretext or the other. Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort in 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed in 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort’s boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort. The fortress-palace was a focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. It’s planning and aesthetics represent the zenith of Mughal creativity prevailing during Shah Jahan’s reign. His successor Aurangzeb added the Pearl Mosque to the emperor’s private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous. After witnessing rise and fall of many Mughal emperors, 1911 saw the visit of the British king and queen for the Delhi Durbar. In preparation of the visit, some buildings were restored. The Red Fort Archaeological Museum was also moved from the drum house to the Mumtaz Mahal. With the Salimgarh Fort, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered puja at the famous 5th century Pashupatinath temple in Nepal on last Monday of Shravan. Modi was at the temple of Lord Shiva for about 45 minutes on a day which is considered pious as it was a Monday that falls in the month of ‘Shravan’. Though I have always been curious about this temple since the time I had seen Devanand’s movie dum maro dum as a child which was extensively shot in Kathmandu and particularly in the temple. Since then it has been on my travel wish list. Now there is a revived interest in the Hindu shrine owing to Modiji’s visit to Nepal and Pashupati Nath temple. Pashupatinath Temple, with its astonishing architectural beauty, stands as a symbol of faith, religion, culture and tradition. Regarded as the most sacred temple of Hindu Lord Shiva in the world, Pashupatinath Temple’s existence dates back to 400 A.D. The richly-ornamented pagoda houses the sacred linga or phallic symbol of Lord Shiva. Thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to pay homage to this temple, that is also known as ‘The Temple of Living Beings’. The temple is UNESCO listed World Heritage Site and its unique Features include  only four priests, appointed by the King, can touch the idol of Lord Shiva. The priests are always from south India and it is believed that this tradition have been started by Sage Shankaracharaya in 6th century. Its architecture is worth talking home about, the two level roofs of the temple are embellished with gold and the four main doors are adorned with silver.  The temple is famous for its awe-inspiring and astounding pagoda architecture. The western door has a statue of a large Bull, Nandi, is ornamented in gold. This black stone idol, about 6 ft in height and circumference, adds to the beauty and charisma of the temple. The present architectural nature of Pashupatinath temple came into existence as a result of renovation by Queen Gangadevi during the reign of Shivasimha Malla (1578-1620 AD). The Hindu temple is located on the banks of the Bagmati River in Deopatan, a village 3 km northwest of Kathmandu. It is dedicated to a manifestation of Shiva called Pashupati (Lord of Animals). It attracts thousands of pilgrims each year, mostly from India. There are a lot of Indian pujaris at the temple. There is a tradition of keeping four priests and one chief priest at the temple from among the Bramhins of south India for centuries. According to legend, the temple was constructed by Pashupreksha of the Somadeva Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, but the first historical records date from the 13th century. Pashupati was a tutelary deity of the ancient rulers of the Kathmandu Valley; in 605 AD, Amshuvarman considered himself favored by his touching of the god’s feet. By the later Middle Ages, many imitations of the temple had been built, such as in Bhaktapur (1480), Lalitpur (1566) and Benares (early 19th century). The original temple was destroyed several times until it was given its present form under King Bhupalendra Malla in 1697. According to a legend, especially the Nepalamahatmya and the Himavatkhanda, the Hindu god Shiva once fled from the other gods in Varanasi to Mrigasthali, the forest on the opposite bank of the Bagmati River from the temple. There, in the form of a gazelle, he slept. When the gods discovered him there and tried to bring him back to Varanasi, he leapt across the river to the opposite bank, where one of his horns broke into four pieces. After this, Shiva became manifest as Pashupati (Lord of Animals) in a four-face (chaturmukha) linga. Pashupati area is regarded as one of the most important places of pilgrimages for the followers of Hinduism. Thousands of devotees from within and outside the country come to pay homage to Pashupatinath every day. And on special occasions like Ekadasi, Sankranti, Mahashivratri, Teej Akshaya, Rakshabandhan, Grahana (eclipse), Poornima (Full moon day) the whole atmosphere turns festive and mirthful as people congregate here in a far greater number. During the Shivaratri (also spelled Shivratri) festival Pashupatinath temple is lit with ghee lamps throughout the night and the temple remains open all night. Thousands of devotees take ritual baths in the Bagmati river on the day of the festival and observe a fast for the whole day. Hundreds of sadhus (sages) from different parts of Nepal and India come here on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. In August, during the Teej festival, thousands of women visit the temple to bathe in the holy waters of the Bagmati River. Because this ritual is meant to bring a long and happy marriage, many women dress in red saris, which are traditionally worn for wedding ceremonies. Full moon and New moon days are also considered auspicious to visit the temple. You should also include this on your travel wish list.

It is considered the cultural center of Japan with 1,600 Buddhist temples, four hundred Shinto shrines, palaces, gardens and architectural treasures. Kyoto was spared during the fire bombing of World War II, making it the only large Japanese city that still has an abundance of pre-war buildings and a popular destination for tourists. The city has many small factories run by artisans who produce traditional Japanese crafts. Kyoto\'s kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center for kimono manufacturing. Kyoto is known as one of the academic centers of Japan, and is home to 37 institutions of higher education, including Kyoto University. Today the city has a population of close to 1.5 million and is the capital of Kyoto Prefecture, as well as a major part of the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto metropolitan area. Though archaeological evidence places the first human settlement on the islands of Japan to approximately 10,000 B.C.E., relatively little is known about human activity in the area before the sixth century C.E. During the eighth century, the powerful Buddhist clergy began to interfere in the affairs of the Imperial government, and the emperor chose to relocate the capital to a region far from the Buddhist influence. The new city, Heiankyō (平安京\u3000, ""Heian capital"") became the seat of Japan\'s imperial court in 794. Later, the city was renamed Kyoto (""capital city""). Kyoto remained Japan\'s capital until the transfer of the government to Edo (now Tokyo) in 1868 at the time of the Imperial Restoration (some Japanese still consider it to be the legal capital). After Edo was renamed Tokyo, (meaning ""Eastern Capital""), Kyoto was known for a short time as Saikyo (西京, Saikyō, ""Western Capital""). In 1945, at the end of World War II, the Target Committee of the United States Manhattan Project placed Kyoto at the top of the list of targets for the dropping of the atomic bomb. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Stimson adamantly refused to bomb Kyoto because it ""was the ancient capital of Japan, a historical city, and one that was of great religious significance to the Japanese."" He had visited the city several times and was ""very much impressed by its ancient culture."" Kyoto was removed from the list and its architectural treasures were preserved. Kyoto is the only large Japanese city that still has an abundance of prewar buildings, such as machiya (traditional townhouses). However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the controversial Kyoto Station complex. Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. Kyoto is located on the middle-western portion of the island of Honshū. Surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, Kyoto is famous for its stifling summer nights with no breezes. Kyoto sits above a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Large scale urbanization has reduced the amount of rain draining into the table and wells across the area are drying up at an increasing rate. As of 2005, the city had an estimated population of 1,474,764 and a population density of 1,775 persons per square kilometer. The total area is 827.9 square kilometers. The original city (the modern-day wards of Nakagyō, Shimogyō-ku and Kamigyō) was laid out in a grid pattern, modeled after the ancient Chinese capital during the Tang Dynasty, Changan, (present-day Xi\'an), in accordance with traditional Chinese geomancy, with the Imperial Palace facing south. The Imperial Palace\'s southward orientation is also the reason why Sakyō-ku (the ""Left Capital"") is in the east, Ukyō-ku (the ""Right Capital"") is in the west. Today, the main business district is located in the south and center of town, with the less populated northern area retaining more vegetation. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names (Japanese streets typically are not named). Kyoto has eleven wards (ku). The main hall of Kiyomizu-dera is notable for its vast veranda, supported by hundreds of pillars, which juts out over the hillside and offers impressive views of the city. The expression ""to jump off the stage at Kiyomizu"" (「清水の舞台から飛び降りる」) refers to an Edo period tradition that held that, if one were to survive jumping from the stage, one\'s wish would be granted. Beneath the main hall is the waterfall Otowa-no-taki, where three channels of water, which is believed to have therapeutic properties and confer health, longevity, and success in studies on anyone who imbibes them, drop into a pond. The temple complex contains several other shrines, notably Jishu-jinja, including Okuninushino-Mikoto, a god of love and ""good matches."" Jishu-jinja possesses a pair of ""love stones"" placed 18 meters apart, which lonely visitors attempt to walk between with their eyes closed. Success in reaching the other stone, eyes closed, is taken as a presage that the pilgrim will find love. Kinkaku-ji (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion Temple), the informal name of Rokuon-ji (鹿苑寺, “Deer Garden Temple”), was originally built in 1397 as a retirement villa for Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. His son converted the building into a Zen temple of the Rinzai school. The temple was burned down several times during the Ōnin War. The entire pavilion except the basement floor is covered with pure gold leaf. The pavilion functions as a shariden, housing relics of the Buddha. On the roof of the pavilion is a golden fenghuang or ""Chinese phoenix."" The temple was burned down in 1950 by a mentally disturbed monk; the present structure dates from 1955, and restoration of the gold leaf and lacquer coatings was completed in 1987. Ginkaku-ji ( 銀閣寺), the ""Temple of the Silver Pavilion,"" is a Buddhist temple in the Higashiyama District of Kyoto. The temple\'s official name is Jishō-ji (慈照寺). It was built in 1474 by the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who sought to emulate the golden Kinkaku-ji commissioned by his grandfather Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. The Kannon hall, known as Ginkaku, the Silver Pavilion, was originally to be covered in silver, but construction was halted due to the increasing severity of the Ōnin War, which broke out in 1467, and the silver covering never placed on the pavilion. The building, originally intended to be a monument to ostentation, is now taken as an example of Japanese refinement and restraint. Like Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji was originally built to serve as a place of rest and solitude for the Shogun. It is said Ashikaga Yoshimasa sat in the pavilion, contemplating the calm and beauty of the gardens as the Ōnin War worsened and Kyoto was burned to the ground. In 1485, Yoshimasa became a Zen Buddhist monk, and after his death the villa became a Buddhist temple, renamed Jishō-ji. In addition to that building, the temple features wooded grounds covered with a variety of mosses, and a Japanese garden, supposedly designed by the great landscape artist Soami. The rock and sand garden of Ginkaku-ji is particularly famous, and a pile of sand said to symbolize Mount Fuji has now come to be a part of the garden. The Heian Jingū (平安神宮) is a Shinto shrine. The torii before the main gate is one of the largest in Japan, and the main building, or shaden (社殿), is designed to imitate the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It was built in 1895 for the 1,100th anniversary of the establishment of Heiankyō (the old name of Kyoto). The shrine is dedicated to Emperor Kammu, who moved the capital to Heian and Emperor Kōmei, the last before Emperor Meiji moved the capital to Tokyo. Ryōan-ji (Shinjitai, 竜安寺; Kyūjitai, 龍安寺, The Temple of the Peaceful Dragon) is a Zen temple located in northwest Kyoto. Belonging to the Myōshinji school of the Rinzai branch of Zen Buddhism, the temple is famous for its karesansui (dry landscape) rock garden, thought to have been built in the late 1400s. The garden consists of raked gravel and fifteen moss-covered boulders, which are placed so that, when looking at the garden from any angle (other than from above) only fourteen of the boulders are visible at one time. It is traditionally said that only through attaining enlightenment would one be able to view the fifteenth boulder. Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyōto Gosho, 京都御所) was the Imperial Palace of Japan for much of its history, from the Heian Period, when the Imperial capital was moved from Nara to Heian-kyo (平安京), (Kyoto), until the Meiji Restoration, when the capital was moved to Tokyo. The Taisho and Showa Emperors had their coronation ceremonies at Kyōto Gosho. Since it was first built in 794, the palace has been destroyed and rebuilt eight times, six of them during the 250-year-long peace of the Edo period. The version currently standing was completed in 1855, the Heian period architecture and style reproduced perfectly. The main gate on the front, south, side of the palace has a cypress-wood roof, and is supported by four pillars. On either side of it trees were planted, which would become very famous and sacred, a cherry (sakura) on the left, and a tachibana tree on the right. This gate was used on the rare occasions by the emperor to welcome a foreign diplomat or dignitary, as well as for many other important ceremonies of the state. The Katsura Imperial Villa (桂離宮, Katsura Rikyū), or Katsura Detached Palace, one of Japan\'s most important large-scale cultural treasures, is a villa with associated gardens and outbuildings in the western suburbs of Kyoto. Its gardens are masterpieces of Japanese gardening, and the buildings are one of the greatest achievements of Japanese architecture. The Shūgaku-in was originally constructed 1655 – 1659 by the retired Emperor Go-Mizunoo. The Upper Garden features a large artificial pond, created by building an earthen dam across a ravine; the pond contains a number of small islands. Unlike the typical Japanese garden, it is a very large stroll garden, making extensive use of the technique of ""borrowed scenery."" After Go-Mizunoo\'s death, his daughter Princess Mitsuko became a nun, and established another temple there, the Ryinku-ji, in what later became the Middle Garden. Tenryū-ji (天龍寺), more formally known as Tenryū Shiseizen-ji (天龍資聖禅寺), located in Susukinobaba-chō, Ukyō Ward, is the head temple of the Tenryū sect of Rinzai Zen Buddhism. The temple was founded by Ashikaga Takauji, primarily to venerate Gautama Buddha, and its first chief priest was Musō Soseki. The temple is ranked as the most important (Rinzai) Zen temple in Kyoto. In the early Heian period, Empress Tachibana no Kachiko, wife of Emperor Saga, founded a temple called Danrin-ji (檀林寺) on the site of present-day Tenryū-ji. The temple fell into disrepair over the next four hundred years, before, in the mid-thirteenth century, Emperor Gosaga and his son Emperor Kameyama turned the area into an imperial villa they christened ""Kameyama Detatched Palace"" (亀山殿, kameyamadono). The name ""Kameyama,"" which literally means ""turtle mountain,"" was selected due to the shape of Mount Ogura, which lies to the west of Tenryū-ji—it is said to be similar to the shape of a turtle\'s shell. The palace was converted into a temple at the behest of Ashikaga Takauji, who became shogun in 1338. Ashikaga had opposed the failed Kemmu Restoration initiated by Emperor Go-daigo, who then decreed that Ashikaga should be hunted down and executed. When Emperor Go-daigo passed away, Ashikaga recommended that Zen monk Musō Soseki construct a temple for his memorial service. At one time, the massive grounds (roughly 330,000 square meters) were said to contain some 150 sub-temples, however, the temple was plagued with numerous fires, and all of the original buildings have been destroyed. Most of the buildings seen today are reconstructions from the latter half of the Meiji period. The Kamo Shrines, Kamigamo Jinja (上鴨神社),  and Shimogamo Jinja (下鴨神社) are a pair of Shinto shrines, dedicated to Kamo Wake-ikazuchi, the kami of thunder, and feature prominently in the Aoi Festival, which occurs in May and involves a procession between the two shrines, horse races, and archery. Kamigamo Shrine, the “higher” or “upper” Kamo Shrine, dating most likely to the seventh century, is famous for its Haiden hall, rebuilt in 1628. A number of priests\' residences are situated on its grounds. Its two large conical sand mounds memorialize the holy trees that once served to welcome spirits. The pagoda of Tō-ji stands 57 meters high, and is the tallest wooden tower in Japan. It dates from the Edo period, when it was rebuilt by order of the third Tokugawa Shogun, Iemitsu. The pagoda has been, and continues to be, a symbol of Kyoto. On the 21st of each month, a famous flea market is held on the Tō-ji temple grounds. This market is popularly called Kōbō-san, in honor of Kōbō Daishi, who died on March 21. Daigo-ji (醍醐寺) is a Shingon Buddhist temple in Fushimi-ku. The main image (honzon) is Yakushi. Rigen-daishi (Shōbō) founded the temple in 874. More than seven centuries later, Toyotomi Hideyoshi held a famous cherry-blossom viewing party there. Saihō-ji (西芳寺), a Rinzai Zen Buddhist temple famed for its moss garden, is commonly referred to as ""Koke-dera"" (苔寺) meaning ""moss temple,"" and is also known as ""Kōinzan Saihō-ji"" (洪隠山西芳寺). According to temple legend, Saihō-ji was constructed during the Nara period by Gyōki, on the location of one of Prince Shōtoku\'s former retreats. The temple first operated as a Hossō temple dedicated to Amitabha, and was known as ""Saihō-ji"" (西方寺) a homophone of the current name. The name was selected because Amitabha is the primary buddha of Pure Land Buddhism, known in Japanese as ""Saihō Gokuraku Jōdo"" (西方 極楽浄土). Legend states that such famous Japanese monks as Kūkai and Hōnen later served as the chief priests of the temple. Although the veracity of these legends is questionable, it is believed that such a predecessor to the current temple did, in fact, exist. Over time, the temple fell into disrepair, and in 1339, the chief priest of the nearby Matsunoo Shrine, Fujiwara Chikahide, summoned the famous Japanese gardener Musō Soseki to help him revive Saihō-ji as a Zen temple. Saihō-ji was destroyed by fire during the Ōnin War, and twice ravaged by floods during the Edo period, but has since been rebuilt. Ironically, the moss for which the temple is known was not part of Musō\'s original design. According to French historian François Berthier, the garden\'s ""islands"" were ""carpeted with white sand"" in the fourteenth century. The moss came much later, of its own accord during the Meiji era (1860-1912), when the monastery lacked sufficient funds for upkeep.[2] Hongan-ji (本願寺, temple of the original vow) is the name of a number of Buddhist temples through Japan\'s history. However, it refers primarily to a pair of temples, which were once one, in Kyoto. The Hongan-ji was established as a temple in 1321, on the site of the Otani Mausoleum, where Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land) sect was buried. Kakunyo became the first chief priest of the Hongan-ji, and dedicated it to the worship of Amida Buddha. The Hongan-ji first gained power and importance in the fifteenth century, when Rennyo became its eighth chief priest. However, the Tendai sect, based on Mount Hiei, saw this expansion as a threat and attacked the Hongan-ji three times with their army of sohei (warrior monks). Rennyo fled to Yoshizaki, Fukui where he founded the Ikko sect. During the Sengoku period, fearing the power of the monks of the Hongan-ji, Oda Nobunaga tried to destroy it. For ten years, he laid siege to the Ishiyama Hongan-ji in Osaka, one of the two primary temple fortresses of the Ikko sect.[3] In 1602, just after Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun, he decreed that the Hongan-ji be split in two. Kyonyo, the twelfth chief priest of Hongan-ji became the first of the Higashi Honganji (or, “The Eastern Temple of the Original Vow”), while Junyo became chief priest of the Nishi Honganji (or, “The Western Temple of the Original Vow”).[3] During the Meiji Restoration in the 1860s, the government set down new guidelines for the management of religious organizations and an organization called Shinshu Otani was put in control of the Higashi Hongan-ji. In 1987, the temple was renamed ""Shinshu Honbyo,"" or New Buddhist Mausoleum, and its purpose reverted to that of a mausoleum. The Nishi Hongan-ji (西本願寺), like the Higashi Hongan-ji, features a huge Goei-do\u3000 (御影堂), founder\'s hall and a smaller Amida-do (阿弥陀堂), or Buddha hall, housing an image of the Amida Buddha. It also contains two Noh stages, one of which claims to be the oldest in existence, and the Kokei no Niwa (虎渓の庭) gardens. The Goei-do at Higashi Hongan-ji dates from 1895 and vies with a number of other structures for the claim of largest wooden building in the world. Other notable sites in and around Kyoto include Kōzan-ji, the Nijo Castle, Arashiyama and its picturesque lake, the Gion and Pontochō geisha quarters, the Philosopher\'s Walk (a favorite path of philosopher Kitaro Nishida), and the canals which line some of the older streets. The ""Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto"" are listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The city\'s industry is mainly comprised of small factories, most of which are run by artisans who produce traditional Japanese crafts. Kyoto\'s kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center for kimono manufacturing. These businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as traditional goods are in less demand. Kyoto\'s only sizable heavy industry is electronics: the city is home to the headquarters of Nintendo, as well as the headquarters of OMRON, Kyocera (Kyoto Ceramic) and Murata Machinery. The apparel giant Wacoal also operates in Kyoto. However, the growth of high-tech industry has not compensated for the decline in traditional industry, and as a result, Kyoto\'s total manufacturing output has declined relative to other cities in Japan. The Toei Uzumasa Eigamura (also known as Kyoto Studio Park and Toei Movie Land) is called the ""Hollywood of Japan.""[4] Like Universal Studios, Eigamura is a film set and theme park in one, and many Japanese period movies were shot here. It features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings including the old Nihonbashi Bridge, a traditional court house, a Meiji period police box and part of the former Yoshiwara red light district, which are used as settings for period movies and television dramas. Occasionally an actual film shooting takes place, and park visitors are welcome to observe the action. Kyoto is known as one of the academic centers of Japan, and is home to 37 institutions of higher education. The three largest and best-known local universities are Doshisha University, Kyoto University, and Ritsumeikan University. Kyoto University is considered to be one of the top universities in Japan, boasting several Nobel laureates such as Yukawa Hideki. Kyoto also has a unique higher education network called the Consortium of Universities in Kyoto, which consists of three national, five public (prefectural and municipal), and 41 private universities, as well as the city and four other organizations. The consortium does not offer a degree; hence is not a federal body like University of London, but offers the courses as part of a degree at participating universities. The city transportation is centered around Kyoto Station (京都駅, Kyoto-eki). The station is the second largest in Japan and holds a shopping mall, hotel, movie theater, Isetan department store, and several local government facilities under one fifteen-story roof. The Tokaido Shinkansen Line (see below) as well as all local rail lines connect here. For many travelers it is a hub of travel and a good place to catch all the buses the city has to offer. Kyoto\'s municipal bus network and subway system are extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take taxis or tour buses. Bicycles are an important form of personal transportation in the city, and are considered a part of Kyoto\'s urban identity. The geography and scale of the city are such that the city may be easily navigated on a bicycle. In soccer, Kyoto is represented by Kyoto Purple Sanga who rose to J. League\'s Division 1 in 2005. Because of the popularity of the nearby Hanshin Tigers, Kyoto has never had a team in Japanese professional baseball, though the Tigers play several neutral-site games at Kyoto\'s Nishi Kyogoku stadium every year, but Kyoto\'s high school baseball teams are strong.

It has a population close to 1.5 million. Formerly the Imperial capital of Japan for more than one thousand years, it is now the capital city of Kyoto Prefecture located in the Kansai region, as well as a major part of the Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe metropolitan area. Kyoto is also known as the thousand-year capital. In Japanese, the city has been called Kyō (京), Miyako (都), or Kyō no Miyako (京の都). In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto (""capital city""), after the Chinese word for capital city, jingdu (京都). After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (東京, meaning ""Eastern Capital"") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saikyō (西京, meaning ""Western Capital""). Obsolete spellings for the city\'s name include Kioto, Miaco and Meaco. Another term commonly used to refer to the city in the pre-modern period was Keishi (京師), meaning ""metropolis"" or ""capital"". Although archaeological evidence suggests human settlement in Kyoto began as early as the Paleolithic period, relatively little is known about human activity in the area before the 6th century AD, around which time the Shimogamo Shrine is believed to have been established. During the 8th century, when powerful Buddhist clergy became involved in the affairs of the Imperial government, Emperor Kanmu chose to relocate the capital in order to distance it from the clerical establishment in Nara. His last choice for the site was the village of Uda, in the Kadono district of Yamashiro Province. The new city, Heian-kyō (平安京, ""tranquility and peace capital""), a scaled replica of the then Tang capital Chang\'an, became the seat of Japan\'s imperial court in 794, beginning the Heian period of Japanese history. Although military rulers established their governments either in Kyoto (Muromachi shogunate) or in other cities such as Kamakura (Kamakura shogunate) and Edo (Tokugawa shogunate), Kyoto remained Japan\'s capital until the transfer of the imperial court to Tokyo in 1869 at the time of the Imperial Restoration. The city suffered extensive destruction in the Ōnin War of 1467–1477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. Battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve the court nobility (kuge) and religious factions as well. Nobles\' mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since. In the late 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi reconstructed the city by building new streets to double the number of north-south streets in central Kyoto, creating rectangle blocks superseding ancient square blocks. Hideyoshi also built earthwork walls called odoi (御土居) encircling the city. Teramachi Street in central Kyoto is a Buddhist temple quarter where Hideyoshi gathered temples in the city. Throughout the Edo period, the economy of the city flourished as one of three major cities in Japan, the others being Osaka and Edo. The Hamaguri rebellion of 1864 burnt down 28,000 houses in the city, and the subsequent move of the Emperor to Tokyo in 1869 weakened the economy. The modern city of Kyoto was formed on April 1, 1889. The construction of Lake Biwa Canal in 1890 was one measure taken to revive the city. The population of the city exceeded one million in 1932. There was some consideration by the United States of targeting Kyoto with an atomic bomb at the end of World War II because, as an intellectual center of Japan, it had a population ""better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon"" In the end, at the insistence of Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by Nagasaki. The city was largely spared from conventional bombing as well, although small-scale air raids did result in casualties. As a result, the Imperial City (Emeritus) of Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as machiya. However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the Kyōto Station complex. Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the protocol on greenhouse gas emissions that bears the city\'s name. Kyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, with a height just above 1,000 metres (3,281\xa0ft) above sea level. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the Ujigawa to the south, the Katsuragawa to the west, and the Kamogawa to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in the prefecture with an area of 827.9 square kilometres (319.7\xa0sq\xa0mi). The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang\'an (present-day Xi\'an). The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Ukyō (the right sector of the capital) being on the west while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Nakagyō, Shimogyō, and Kamigyō-ku still follow a grid pattern. Today, the main business district is located to the south of the old Imperial Palace, with the less-populated northern area retaining a far greener feel. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names. Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate. Historically, Kyoto was the largest city in Japan, later surpassed by Osaka and Edo (Tokyo) towards the end of the 16th century. In the pre-war years, Kyoto traded places with Kobe and Nagoya ranking as the 4th and 5th largest city. In 1947, it went back to being 3rd. By 1960 it had fallen to 5th again, and by 1990 it had fallen to 7th, in 2015 it is now 9th. Kyoto has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), featuring a marked seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are relatively cold with occasional snowfall. Kyoto\'s rain season begins around the middle of June and lasts until the end of July, yielding to a hot and sunny latter half of the summer. Kyoto, along with most of the Pacific coast and central areas of Japan is prone to typhoons during September and October. The directly elected executive mayor in Kyoto as of 2013 is Daisaku Kadokawa, an independent supported by Democratic Party of Japan, Liberal Democratic Party, New Komeito Party, Your Party and Social Democratic Party. The legislative city assembly has 69 elected members. Kyoto has eleven wards (区, ku). Together, they make up the city of Kyoto. Like other cities in Japan, Kyoto has a single mayor and a city council. Although ravaged by wars, fires, and earthquakes during its eleven centuries as the imperial capital, Kyoto was spared from much of the destruction of World War II. It was removed from the atomic bomb target list (which it had headed) by the personal intervention of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, as Stimson wanted to save this cultural center, which he knew from his honeymoon and later diplomatic visits. With its 2,000 religious places – 1,600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines, as well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact – it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Among the most famous temples in Japan are Kiyomizu-dera, a magnificent wooden temple supported by pillars off the slope of a mountain; Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion; Ginkaku-ji, the Temple of the Silver Pavilion; and Ryōan-ji, famous for its rock garden. The Heian Jingū is a Shinto shrine, built in 1895, celebrating the Imperial family and commemorating the first and last emperors to reside in Kyoto. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: the Kyoto Gyoen area including the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, homes of the Emperors of Japan for many centuries; Katsura Imperial Villa, one of the nation\'s finest architectural treasures; and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa, one of its best Japanese gardens. In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from Shijō to Kōmei. Other sites in Kyoto include Arashiyama, the Gion and Pontochō geisha quarters, the Philosopher\'s Walk, and the canals that line some of the older streets. The ""Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto"" are listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. These include the Kamo Shrines (Kami and Shimo), Kyō-ō-Gokokuji (Tō-ji), Kiyomizu-dera, Daigo-ji, Ninna-ji, Saihō-ji (Kokedera), Tenryū-ji, Rokuon-ji (Kinkaku-ji), Jishō-ji (Ginkaku-ji), Ryōan-ji, Hongan-ji, Kōzan-ji and the Nijō Castle, primarily built by the Tokugawa shoguns. Other sites outside the city are also on the list. Kyoto is renowned for its abundance of delicious Japanese foods and cuisine. The special circumstances of Kyoto as a city away from the sea and home to many Buddhist temples resulted in the development of a variety of vegetables peculiar to the Kyoto area (京野菜, kyō-yasai). Japan\'s television and film industry has its center in Kyoto. Many jidaigeki, action films featuring samurai, were shot at Toei Uzumasa Eigamura. A film set and theme park in one, Eigamura features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings, which are used for jidaigeki. Among the sets are a replica of the old Nihonbashi (the bridge at the entry to Edo), a traditional courthouse, a Meiji Period police box and part of the former Yoshiwara red-light district. Actual film shooting takes place occasionally, and visitors are welcome to observe the action. The dialect spoken in Kyoto is known as Kyō-kotoba or Kyōto-ben, a constituent dialect of the Kansai dialect. When Kyoto was the capital of Japan, the Kyoto dialect was the de facto standard Japanese and influenced the development of Tokyo dialect, the modern standard Japanese. Famous Kyoto expressions are a polite copula dosu, an honorific verb ending -haru, a greeting phrase okoshi-yasu ""welcome"", etc. The key industry of Kyoto is information technology and electronics: the city is home to the headquarters of Nintendo, Intelligent Systems, Dainippon Screen, Tose, Omron, Kyocera, Shimadzu Corp., Rohm, Horiba, Nidec Corporation, Nichicon, Nissin Electric, and GS Yuasa. Tourism also forms a large base of Kyoto\'s economy. The city\'s cultural heritages are constantly visited by school groups from across Japan, and many foreign tourists also stop in Kyoto. In 2014, the city government announced that a record number of tourists had visited Kyoto, and it was chosen as the world\'s best city by U.S. travel magazine. Traditional Japanese crafts are also major industry of Kyoto, most of which are run by artisans in small plants. Kyoto\'s kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Such businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as sales of traditional goods stagnate. Sake brewing is Kyoto\'s traditional industry. Gekkeikan and Takara Holdings are major sake brewers headquartered in Kyoto. Other notable businesses headquartered in Kyoto includes Aiful, Ishida, MK, Nissen Holdings, Oh-sho, Sagawa Express, Volks and Wacoal. The concentration of population to the capital city area is 55%, which is highest among the prefectures. The economic difference between the coastal area and inland area including Kyoto basin is significant. Greater Kyoto, Kyoto Metropolitan Employment Area, (2.7 million people) had a total GDP of US$115.3 million in 2010. Home to 37 institutions of higher education, Kyoto is one of the academic centers in Japan.Kyoto University is considered to be one of the top national universities nationwide. According to The Times Higher Education Supplement top-ranking university, Kyoto University is ranked the second university in Japan after University of Tokyo, and 25th overall in the world as of 2010. The Kyoto Institute of Technology is also among the most famous universities in Japan and is considered to be one of the best universities for architecture and design in the country. Popular private universities, such as Doshisha University and Ritsumeikan University are also located in the city. Kyoto also has a unique higher education network called the Consortium of Universities in Kyoto, which consists of three national, three public (prefectural and municipal), and 45 private universities, as well as the city and five other organizations. The combination does not offer a degree, but offers the courses as part of a degree at participating universities. In addition to Japanese universities and colleges, selected American universities also operates in the city for education and research. Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS) is a combination of 14 American universities that sponsors a two-semester academic program for undergraduates who wish to do advanced work in Japanese language and cultural studies. The American university, Stanford University, operates a ""Japan Center"" in Kyoto. Although Kyoto does not have its own airport, travelers can get to the city via Kansai International Airport and Osaka International Airport in Osaka Prefecture. The Haruka Express operated by JR West carries passengers from Kansai Airport to Kyoto Station in 73 minutes. Osaka Airport Transport buses connect Itami Airport and Kyoto Station Hachijo Gate in 50 minutes and cost 1,280 yen for a one-way trip. Some buses go further, make stops at major hotels and terminals in downtown area. Kyoto\'s municipal bus network is extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take tour buses. Kyoto\'s buses have announcements in English and electronic signs with stops written in the Latin alphabet. Most city buses have a fixed fare. A one-day bus pass and a combined unlimited train and bus pass are also available. These are especially useful for visiting many different points of interest within Kyoto. The bus information center just outside the central station handles tickets and passes. The municipal transport company publishes a very useful leaflet called ""Bus Navi."" It contains a route map for the bus lines to most sights and fare information. This too is available at the information center in front of the main station. Buses operating on routes within the city, the region, and the nation stop at Kyoto Station. In addition to Kyoto Station, bus transfer is available at the intersections of Shijō Kawaramachi and Sanjō Keihan. The intersection of Karasuma Kitaōji to the north of downtown has a major bus terminal serving passengers who take the Karasuma Line running beneath Karasuma Street, Kyoto\'s main north–south street. Cycling is a very important form of personal transportation in the city. The geography and scale of the city are such that the city may be easily navigated on a bicycle. Bicycle theft is not common, but finding permitted bicycle parking areas can be difficult. Bicycles parked in non-permitted areas are impounded. The city is connected with other parts of Japan by the Meishin Expressway, which has two interchanges in the city: Kyoto Higashi (Kyoto East) in Yamashina-ku and Kyoto Minami (Kyoto South) in Fushimi-ku. The Kyoto-Jukan Expressway connects the city to northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture. The Daini Keihan Road is a new bypass (completed in 2010) to Osaka. Although Kyoto has fewer toll-highways than other comparable Japanese cities, it is served with dual and even triple-carriageway national roads. As of 2010, only 8.2 kilometres (5.1 miles) of the Hanshin Expressway Kyoto Route is in operation. There are nine national highways in the city of Kyoto: Route 1, Route 8, Route 9, Route 24, Route 162, Route 171, Route 367, Route 477 and Route 478. Just like other major cities in Japan, Kyoto is well served by rail transportation systems operated by several different companies and organizations. The city\'s main gateway terminal, Kyoto Station, which is one of the most popular stations in the country, connects The Tōkaidō Shinkansen bullet train Line (see below) with five JR West lines, a Kintetsu line and a municipal subway line. The Keihan, the Hankyu, and other rail networks also offer frequent services within the city and to other cities and suburbs in the Kinki region. The Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau operates the Kyoto Municipal Subway consisting of two lines: the Karasuma Line and the Tōzai Line. The Karasuma Line is coloured green, and its stations are given numbers following the letter ""K"". The line has following stations, from north to south: Kokusaikaikan (terminal) and Matsugasaki in Sakyō-ku; Kitayama and Kitaōji in Kita-ku; Kuramaguchi and Imadegawa in Kamigyō-ku; Marutamachi and Karasuma Oike in Nakagyō-ku; Shijō, Gojō and Kyōto in Shimogyō-ku; Kujō and Jūjō in Minami-ku; and Kuinabashi and Takeda (terminal) in Fushimi-ku. Between Kitaōji and Jūjō, trains run beneath the north-south Karasuma Street (烏丸通, Karasuma-dori), hence the name. They link to the other subway line, the Tōzai Line, at Karasuma Oike. They also connect to the JR lines at Kyoto Station and the Hankyu Kyoto Line running cross-town beneath Shijō Street at the intersection of Shijō Karasuma, Kyoto\'s central business district. At Shijō Karasuma, the subway station is named Shijō, whereas Hankyu\'s station is called Karasuma. The Transportation Bureau and Kintetsu jointly operate through services, which continue to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line to Kintetsu Nara Station in Nara. The Karasuma Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line connect at Kyoto and Takeda. All the stations are located in the city proper. The Tōzai Line is coloured vermilion, and its stations are given numbers following the letter ""T"". This line runs from the southeastern area of the city, then east to west (i.e. tōzai in Japanese) through the Kyoto downtown area where trains run beneath the three east-west streets: Sanjō Street (三条通, Sanjō-dori), Oike Street (御池通, Oike-dori) and Oshikōji Street (押小路通, Oshikōji-dori). The line has following stations, from east to west: Rokujizō (terminal) in Uji; Ishida and Daigo in Fushimi-ku; Ono, Nagitsuji, Higashino, Yamashina and Misasagi in Yamashina-ku; Keage, Higashiyama and Sanjō Keihan in Higashiyama-ku; Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae, Karasuma Oike, Nijōjō-mae, Nijō and Nishiōji Oike in Nakagyō-ku; and Uzumasa Tenjingawa (terminal) in Ukyō-ku. The Keihan Keishin Line has been integrated into this line, and thus Keihan provides through services from Hamaōtsu in the neighbouring city of Ōtsu, the capital of Shiga Prefecture. The Tōzai Line connects to the Keihan lines at Rokujizō, Yamashina, Misasagi and Sanjō Keihan, to the JR lines at Nijō, Yamashina and Rokujizō, and to the Keifuku Electric Railroad at Uzumasa Tenjingawa. All the stations except Rokujizō are located in Kyoto. The Tōkaidō Shinkansen operated by JR Central provides high-speed rail service linking Kyoto with Nagoya, Yokohama and Tokyo to the east of Kyoto and with nearby Osaka and points west on the San\'yō Shinkansen, such as Kobe, Okayama, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu, and Fukuoka. The trip from Tokyo takes about two hours and twenty-two minutes. From Hakata in Fukuoka, Nozomi takes you to Kyoto in just over three hours. All trains including Nozomi stop at Kyoto Station, serving as a gateway to not only Kyoto Prefecture but also northeast Osaka, south Shiga and north Nara. There are a number of rivers, canals and other navigable waterways in Kyoto. The Seta and Uji rivers (Yodo River), Kamogawa and Katsura river flow through Kyoto. Lake Biwa Canal was a significant infrastructural development. In present days, however, the waterways are not used for passenger or goods transportation except for limited sightseeing purpose such as Hozugawa Kudari boat on the Hozu River and Jukkoku bune sightseeing tour boat in Fushimi-ku area. Kyoto contains roughly 2,000 temples and shrines. About 20% of Japan\'s National Treasures and 14% of Important Cultural Properties exist in the city proper. The UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities) includes 17 locations in Kyoto, Uji in Kyoto Prefecture, and Ōtsu in Shiga Prefecture. The site was designated as World Heritage in 1994. Kyoto is well known for its traditional festivals which have been held for over 1000 years and are a major tourist attraction. The first is the Aoi Matsuri on May 15. Two months later (July 1 to 31) is the Gion Matsuri known as one of the 3 great festivals of Japan, culminating in a massive parade on July 17. Kyoto marks the Bon Festival with the Gozan no Okuribi, lighting fires on mountains to guide the spirits home (August 16). The October 22 Jidai Matsuri, Festival of the Ages, celebrates Kyoto\'s illustrious past. In football, Kyoto is represented by Kyoto Sanga F.C. who won the Emperor\'s Cup in 2002, and rose to J. League\'s Division 1 in 2005. Kyoto Sanga has a long history as an amateur non-company club, although it was only with the advent of professionalization that it was able to compete in the Japanese top division. Amateur football clubs such as F.C. Kyoto BAMB 1993 and Kyoto Shiko Club (both breakaway factions of the original Kyoto Shiko club that became Kyoto Sanga) as well as unrelated AS Laranja Kyoto compete in the regional Kansai soccer league. Between 1951 and 1952 the Central League team Shochiku Robins played their franchised games at Kinugasa Ballpark (ja:衣笠球場, Kinugasa Kyujo) in Kita-ku. In 2010, Nishikyogoku Stadium in Ukyo-ku became the home of a newly formed girls professional baseball team, the Kyoto Asto Dreams. Additionally, Kyoto\'s high school baseball teams are strong, with Heian and Toba in particular making strong showings recently at the annual tournament held in Koshien Stadium, Nishinomiya, near Osaka. Kyoto Racecourse in Fushimi-ku is one of ten racecourses operated by the Japan Racing Association. It hosts notable horse races including the Kikuka-shō, Spring Tenno Sho, and Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup. Kyoto, having been the capital city of Japan, a seat of learning and culture, has long-established ties with other great cities around the world. Many foreign scholars, artists and writers have stayed in Kyoto over the centuries. In addition to its sister city arrangements which involve multi-faceted cooperation, Kyoto has created a system of ""partner cities"" which focus on cooperation based on a particular topic. At present, Kyoto has partner-city arrangements with the following cities:', '', 'Tokyo is Japan’s vast and prosperous city, brimming with culture, trade, and, most importantly, people. Tokyo, the world’s most populous metropolitan region, is a fascinating and vibrant city that blends high-tech dreams of the future with glimpses of ancient Japan. From cutting-edge technology and sparkling skyscrapers to cherry blossoms and the Imperial Palace, this city encapsulates the whole of Japanese history and culture. Tokyo definitely has much to offer every visitor.

We search for destinations through a large booking services database. This way we find the best discounts and offer them to you. The temples of Asakusa, the grounds of the Imperial Palace (near Chiyoda), and the Meiji Shrine are the first things on most tourists’ agendas when they arrive in Tokyo. Tokyo boasts a plethora of commercial districts where you may go shopping, dine, or just roam about to get a sense of the contemporary Japanese urban phenomena. Each of these districts has its own distinct personality, such as sparkling Shinjuku, lively Shibuya, and upscale Ginza. These locations are busy throughout the day, but they truly come alive in the nights. The city is strewn with museums, both big and little, specializing in anything from pens to ancient clocks to traditional and contemporary arts. Many of the city’s biggest museums are concentrated around Ueno. The old city of Tokyo, as well as the bulk of mainland Tokyo, have a humid subtropical climate with hot humid summers and typically pleasant winters with chilly periods. The area, like most of Japan, has a one-month seasonal lag, with August being the hottest month, averaging 26.4 °C (79.5 °F), and January being the lowest, averaging 5.2 °C (41.4 °F). The annual rainfall averages almost 1,530 mm (60.2 in), with a wetter summer and a dryer winter. Snowfall is infrequent but occurs practically every year. The mainland section of Tokyo is located northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures around 90 kilometers (56 miles) east to west and 25 kilometers (16 miles) north to south. Tokyo has an average elevation of 40 meters (131 ft). Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi Prefecture to the west, Kanagawa Prefecture to the south, and Saitama Prefecture to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further separated into special wards (which constitute the eastern half) and the Tama region, which extends westwards. Tokyo Metropolis also includes two island chains in the Pacific Ocean to the south: the Izu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, which span more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the mainland. Because of these islands and the hilly regions to the west, Tokyo’s total population density numbers drastically understate the true figures for the city’s urban and suburban areas. Aside from these 23 special wards, Tokyo has 26 additional cities (-shi), five towns (-ch or machi), and eight villages (-son or -mura), each with its own local administration. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which governs the whole metropolis, is led by a governor and metropolitan assembly who are chosen by the general population. Shinjuku Ward is home to its headquarters. Tokyo boasts the world’s biggest metropolitan economy. Tokyo is home to 51 of the Global 500 firms, about double the number of the second-placed city (Paris). Tokyo is a prominent worldwide financial center that is home to the headquarters of some of the world’s top investment banks and insurance corporations, as well as a hub for Japan’s transportation, publishing, electronics, and broadcasting sectors. During Japan’s postwar economic development, several prominent corporations relocated their headquarters from locations such as Osaka (the historical commercial hub) to Tokyo in order to have greater access to the government. This tendency has started to decelerate as a result of Tokyo’s continued population expansion and high expense of living. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Tokyo as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row, ending in 2006. Tokyo, along with New York City and London, has been regarded as one of the three “command hubs” for the global economy. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan’s biggest stock exchange, as well as the world’s third largest in terms of market capitalization and fourth largest in terms of share turnover. Tokyo’s tourism industry also contributes to the city’s economy. According to the Tokyo administration, 4.81 million overseas visitors and 420 million Japanese visitors visited Tokyo in 2006, with a total economic value of 9.4 trillion yen. Many visitors visit the many downtowns, businesses, and entertainment areas across the special wards of Tokyo; for schoolchildren on field excursions, a visit to the Tokyo Tower is mandatory. Cultural offerings include the ubiquitous Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, as well as subcultural attractions such as the Studio Ghibli anime center and museums such as the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37 percent of the country’s artwork national treasures. Tsukiji Fish Market in downtown Tokyo is the world’s largest wholesale fish and seafood market, as well as one of the world’s largest wholesale food marketplaces of any sort. The Tsukiji market upholds the traditions of its forefather, the Nihombashi fish market, and serves over 50,000 buyers and sellers each day. Retailers, wholesalers, auctioneers, and ordinary residents all attend the market, producing a unique microcosm of ordered chaos that, after four centuries, continues to power the city and its food supply. There are good connections accessible in Internet cafés all around the place. Expect to get paid between ¥400 and ¥500 per hour. “Gera Gera” is a well-known chain. Paid WiFi service is also becoming popularity in Tokyo, providing enough coverage for a fee. WiFi services are possibly inconvenient for individuals who are only passing through. If you bring your own computer with a WLAN card, you may discover wifi connections at fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s or Mos Burger. You may possibly be able to make a connection at one of the countless coffee shops. Simply seek for a sign indicating a wifi connection in the front display or PCs inside the business. It’s worth noting that free wifi isn’t nearly as common in Japan as it is in the West. Foreigners are not permitted to purchase disposable “burner” mobile phones or SIM cards, however they are permitted to rent mobile phones, SIM cards, and portable wifi hotspots.

In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto (""capital city""), after the Chinese word for capital city, jingdu (京都). After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (東京, meaning ""Eastern Capital"") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saikyō (西京, meaning ""Western Capital"").

It is a proportionality factor that relates energy scales and temperature scales in several equations. P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, and T is temperature. Rearranging the equation, you can solve for R: E is the cell potential, E0 is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of mole of electrons exchanged, F is Faraday\'s constant, and Q is the reaction quotient. The gas constant is equivalent to the Boltzmann constant, just expressed in units of energy per temperature per mole, while the Boltzmann constant is given in terms of energy per temperature per particle. From a physical standpoint, the gas constant is a proportionality constant that related the energy scale to the temperature scale for a mole of particles at a given temperature. Units for the gas constant vary, depending on other units used in the equation. The value of the gas constant \'R\' depends on the units used for pressure, volume and temperature. Prior to 2019, these were common values for the gas constant. In 2019, the SI base units were redefined. Both Avogadro\'s number and the Boltzmann constant were given exact numerical values. As a consequence, the gas constant also now has an exact value: 8.31446261815324 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. Because of the relatively recent definition change, use care when comparing calculations prior to 2019 because the values for R are slightly different before and after the redefinition. Some people assume the symbol R is used for the gas constant in honor of the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault, who performed experiments that were first used to determine the constant. However, it\'s unclear whether his name is the true origin of the convention used to denote the constant. A related factor is the specific gas constant or individual gas constant. This may be indicated by R or Rgas. It is the universal gas constant divided by the molar mass (M) of a pure gas or mixture. This constant is specific to the particular gas or mixture (hence its name), while the universal gas constant is the same for an ideal gas. The United States government uses a defined value of R, indicated by R*, in its definition of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere. Agencies using R* include NASA, NOAA, and the USAF. By definition, R* is exactly 8.31432×103\xa0N⋅m⋅kmol−1⋅K−1\xa0or\xa08.31432\xa0J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. While this gas constant value is inconsistent with the Boltzmann constant and Avogadro constant, the discrepancy is not huge. It does deviate slightly from the ISO value of R for calculating pressure as a function of altitude.

After that the Nawab decided and announced some portion from Kishanganj Gudri to Ramzan pool gandhi ghat as Krishna-Kunj. As time passed by the name got converted to present Kishanganj. Formation of District:- Kishanganj was the old and important Sub-Division of Purnea. After the long and hard struggle of Seventeen Years from people of Kishanganj including Social Workers, politicians, journalist, businessman’s,Farmers etc., the Kishanganj District came into existence on 14th January 1990. Geography:-Kishanganj district occupies an area of 1,884 square kilometers. Kishanganj district is surrounded by Araria district in the West, Purnia district in the south-west, Uttar Dinajpur district of West Bengal on the east, and Darjeeling district of West Bengal and Nepal on the north. A narrow strip of West Bengal, about 20km wide separates it from Bangladesh. Kishanganj district is located between 25.20 and 26.30 north latitudes, and 87.7 and 88.19 east longitudes. Major rivers flowing through the district are Mahananda, Kankai, Mechi, Donk, Ratua and Ramzan Sudhani. Demography:- The population of Kishanganj district is 107,076 as of Census 2011. Out of 107,076 there are 55,688 male and 51,388 female. The male and female literacy rate is 71.7 and 56.3 respectively with an average literacy rate 64.24 as of Census 2011. It is one of the few districts where the population of Muslims is in majority. Transport:- Kishanganj has a major railhead which is connected to major cities and towns of India. Kishanganj railway station belongs to Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR). The National Highway no. 31 also passes through Kishanganj. The railway station and NH 31 are connecting northeastern region of India to the rest of India. The railway station has some direct trains to some major cities of India like New Delhi, Mumbai, Patna, Kolkata, Guwahati, Bangalore, Chennai, Trivandrum etc. Rajdhani Express has also its stoppage in Kishanganj which runs between New Delhi and Guwahati. The starting train from Kishanganj is Garib Nawaz for Ajmer. NH 31 is one of the important and busiest highways in India.', 'Chhattisgarh, located in Central India, has been carved out of Madhya Pradesh to  become the 26th state of the Indian Union. It is endowed with huge mineral  deposits and forest resources. Chhattisgarh also has the largest concentration of  Schedule Tribes in the country. Its cities, especially Raipur are full of migrants from  other parts of the country. The state has tropical climate with hot summer and cold  winters. Most of the precipitation occurs during the monsoon (July to  mid-September). Day temperature during the summers (mid-April to June end) can  touch a high of around 45°C while in the winters the temperature may fall well  below 10°C. Chhattisgarh is located in central India, Chhattisgarh is one of the few  landlocked states of the country. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar bind the State in  north, in the east it is bound by Orissa, in the south by Andhra Pradesh and in  the West by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. A large part of the state comes  under Vindhyachal range that divides the Indian subcontinent into two. Mahanadi and Narmada are the principal rivers of the  state. Narmada has its origin in Amarkantak, which lies in Chhattisgarh. A major part of the Chhattisgarh as we know today was known as Dandakaranya in  the ancient times. Other parts were known as Dakshina Koshal. In the medieval  period, the region, which falls south of the Vindhyas, came to be known as  Gondwana. Earliest human settlements were established in this region  much before they came into existence in any other part of the country.  Historians and anthropologists are trying to establish the exact date for the  earliest human settlement in this region. Right from the beginning, Chhattisgarh has been swarmed  with migrants from nearby places, who now constitute a major part of the  population. Right from the days of great Magadha Empire, Chhattisgarh remained  part of every empire that ruled the country from north to south, but their  dominance was political only. As the region was extremely inaccessible, not much  interference could be made in the lifestyle of the tribes. Kalchuris were the  first rulers who ruled clearly over this region till 19th century. After the  fall of Kalchuris, it was time for the Bhonsles of Nagpur to dominate over this  region for a brief period in the 19th century. However with the decline of the  Marathas, there prevailed complete lawlessness throughout the region and many  tribal chieftains established rule over small tracts of land. The English recognized the mineral wealth of the region  and established a vast network of mines and railway track throughout the region,  which marked the beginning of a new phase in the tribal history of Chhattisgarh. Chhattisgarh has 16 districts: Bastar, Bilaspur, Dantewada (South Bastar),  Dhamtari, Durg, Janjgir-Champa, Jashpur, Kanker (North Bastar), Kawardha, Korba,  Koriya (Korea), Mahasamund, Raigarh, Raipur, Rajnandgaon, and Surguja. The state has immense Mineral and forest resources. Substantial deposits of  limestone, iron-ore, copper-ore, rock phosphate, manganese-ore, bauxite, coal,  asbestos and mica exist in the newly formed state. Major industries of the state  are iron and steel, power generation, and mining. The state has a good network of roads and rail connecting  every part. It also has lot of potential for power generation. Agriculturally it is a very productive area. The soil and  climate here are suitable for rice, which is grown here in large quantities.  Chhattisgarh supplies food grain to almost 600 rice mills. Another bigger source of income for the state is forest  revenue. Major tourist centers in the state are Amarkantak, Banjari Baba, Bhoramdev,  Champaranya, Chitrakoot, Dudhadharimath, Indrawati National Park, Kangerghati  National Park, Jagdalpur, Bastar, Danteswari Temple, and many more. Raipur is the capital of the newly formed State of  Chhattisgarh, carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1st November 2000. The city believed to be founded in the 14th century AD by  the Kalchuri King Ram Chandra is centrally located in Chattisgarh. Raipur is the biggest city of the region and a fast  developing important industrial center. The main river of this area is Mahanadi. Godavari, Rihand, Hatkul, Chinar, Doodh,  Sendoor, Nakti, Shivnath, Hasdo, Mand, Eb, Pary, Jonk, Kelo, Udanti, Sukha and  Doori are the other rivers of the area. Godavari is the second laergest river.  Rihand is main river in northern side of Chhattisgarh. The rate of development in the field of education is slow still the state has  committed to spread the knowledge and freedom of thought among its citizens,  which is reflected in its policy. The overall literacy rate for the state as per census 2001  is 65.12%, with male literacy rate at 77.86% and female literacy rate at 55.28%.  The state has been providing free and compulsory education to its children until  they complete the age of fourteen years. The state government is emphasizing more on the  educational interests of the underprivileged sections, particularly, the  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to raise their literacy standards. The higher educational status of the state is no less encouraging. The state has  8 universities, 3 medical colleges and a number of professional colleges. Students after completion of their +2 (class XII) prepare  to go for higher study. They continue their study with the subjects taken in +2  level or switch over to professional degrees like engineering, management and  medical. The state is stepping forth with focused growth on  education particularly at the primary and secondary levels. Rice is the principal crop of the area, and forms the main part of the diet of  these people. Interestingly red ants, flying ants, mushrooms, squirrels, and  rats are some of the other special delicacies. Liquor, brewed from mahuwa is an important delicacy among  the tribal people. They are fond of fish as well. Majority of the population in Chhattisgarh comprises of the local tribal groups. Gonds form the largest group among these natural residents  of the land followed by Oraon, Kanwar, Baiga, Kamar, Birhar Saura, Role and so  many other tribes. It also has a good percentage of schedule castes and other  backward classes. This apart, it also has a sizable migrant population with  migrations taking place from all over the country through centuries. Now these  migrant groups are a part of the cultural milieu that the state presents. Religiously, majority of the people are Hindus, Christians  and Muslims comprise only a small part. Chhattisgarh often resounds and reverberates with the  beats of the drum. Country-dances are the chief source of amusement. Dance  and music forms of this state have very close relation to its tribal heritage  and culture that they are practicing from the time immemorial. Major music forms  of the state are Pandwani singing, Chandeni, and Bharthari. Some of the popular dance forms of the state are Panthi  Dance, Nacha, Gond, and Muria. Ghotul is a better-known event in tribal life and they  have aroused considerable interest from anthropologists to study the tradition.  Both boys and girls are allowed to spend a night out in the ghotul (kind of rest  house), every week. Ghotuls are regarded as a shrine, built by Lingo Pen, a Gond  (a tribe) cult hero. Here, the unmarried boys of the village learn songs and  dance from their leader. Besides, every week, there is a dance carnival as well  in which the girls also take part. Moreover, It is treated like a pilgrimage. Dussehra is celebrated with much enthusiasm in Jagdalpur  every year.

our common future from one earth to one world summary,"['“Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. The concept of sustainable development can be traced to 1987 and the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) – commonly known as the Brundtland Commission, named for its Chair, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and its report, Our Common Future. The commission was charged with developing recommendations for paths towards economic and social development that would not achieve short-term economic growth at the expense of long-term environmental and economic stability. The central idea of the Brundtland Commission\'s definition of ""sustainable development"" is that of intergenerational equity and the Commission presented the environment as something beyond physicality, to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation. The Brundtland Commission Report\xa0recognized\xa0that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for\xa0environmental conservation, and it also\xa0recognized\xa0that environmental-limits to economic growth in\xa0industrialized and industrializing\xa0societies existed. As such, the Report offered “[the]\xa0analysis, the broad\xa0remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987: 16).\xa0 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brundtland_Commission). The Brundtland Commissioners came from 21 very different nations. \xa0They ended the report by stating: ""In our discussions, we disagreed often on details and priorities. But despite our widely differing backgrounds and varying national\xa0and international responsibilities, we were able to agree to the lines along which institutional change must be drawn. We are unanimous in our conviction that the security,\xa0well-being, and very survival of the planet depends on such changes, now."" That was over 25 years ago... The work of many involved in sustainable development, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is based on the definitions and frameworks set out by the Brundtland Commission. The GRI has developed protocols for the development of sustainability plans generally and for specific sectors;\xa0 and overall, recommends that organizations determine a sustainability strategy to guide their actions internally and with stakeholders.

The Chairperson of the Commission, Gro Harlem Brundtland, was appointed by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, former Secretary General of the United Nations, in December 1983. At the time, the UN General Assembly realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the Brundtland Commission. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former Prime Minister of Norway and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and public health. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing Our Common Future, also known as the Brundtland Report, in October 1987, a document which coined, and defined the meaning of the term ""Sustainable Development"". Our Common Future won the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in 1991.[1] The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission. In December 1983, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, asked the Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland, to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.[3] This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland as Chairman and Mansour Khalid as Vice-Chairman. The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “Our Common Future,” the organization’s main report. “Our Common Future” strongly influenced the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.[4] During the 1980s it had been revealed that the World Bank had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the Third World. This was most notable through the events at Bretton Woods in 1945. The ideas of neoliberalism and the institutions promoting economic globalization dominated the political agenda of the world\'s then leading trading nations: the United States under President Ronald Reagan and Great Britain under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, both classical liberals. These events led into an era of free markets built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the World Trade Organization ushered in by United States President Bill Clinton. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged multinational corporations and actually undermined the sovereignty of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods. The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of ""economic development"" as the new idea of ""sustainable development"" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.[5] To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development. The 1983 General Assembly passed Resolution 38/161 ""Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond"", establishing the Commission.[6] In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly: The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of sustainable development, which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date. A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the ""environment"" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while ""development"" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues: ""...the ""environment"" is where we live; and ""development"" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."" The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation. Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission\'s definition of ""sustainable development"" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the ""needs"" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates. The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as ""self-defeating and compromised rhetoric"".[8] It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population. The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world. The Brundtland Commission\'s mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27). The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development. The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited: The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is William Ruckelshaus, former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and Mansour Khalid, the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton\'s Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 Earth Summits were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as deforestation and ozone depletion) to be looked at from a holistic approach.[9] The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries\' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission\'s efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, Our Common Future, the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as Agenda\xa021, came out of the meeting. Agenda\xa021 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.[10] Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda\xa021 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda\xa021 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.[11] Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20\xa0years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.[12] The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that ""roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world\'s population"". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.[13] The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be,as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in China and India.[13] In May of 1984. an Organizational Meeting of the Commission was held in Geneva to adopt its rues of procedure and operation and to appoint a Secretary General to guide its work. In July of 1984, a Secretariat was established in Geneva, temporarily at the Centre de Morillon and later at the Palais Wilson. Members of the Secratariat have included:']","The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. The Brundtland Report claimed that poverty reduces sustainability and accelerates environmental pressures -- creating a need for the balancing between economy and ecology. As such, the Report offered ""(the) analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development"" within such societies (1987: 16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed (and expanded); this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development."
