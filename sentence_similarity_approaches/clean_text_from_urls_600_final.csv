who plays mance rayder in game of thrones,"[""Ciarán Hinds (born 9 February 1953) is a Northern Irish film, television and stage actor. He has built a reputation as a versatile character actor appearing in such high-profile films as Road to Perdition, The Phantom of the Opera, Munich, There Will Be Blood, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, The Woman in Black, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Frozen. His television roles include Gaius Julius Caesar in the series Rome, DCI James Langton in Above Suspicion, Bud Hammond in Political Animals and Mance Rayder in the Emmy Award-winning Game of Thrones. As a stage actor, Hinds has enjoyed spells with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal National Theatre in London and six seasons with Glasgow Citizens' Theatre. Adding to his New York Broadway theatre performances, Hinds starred in a production of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof as Big Daddy in early 2013. Hinds was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Brought up as a Catholic in North Belfast, he was one of five children and the only son of his doctor father and schoolteacher mother. His mother, Moya, was also an amateur actress. He was an Irish dancer in his youth and was educated at Holy Family Primary School and St. Malachy's College. After leaving St. Malachy's, he enrolled as a law student at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB), but was soon persuaded to pursue acting and abandoned his studies at Queen's to enroll at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Hinds began his professional acting career at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre in a 1976 production of Cinderella. He remained a frequent performer at the Citizens' Theatre during the late 1970s and through the mid-1980s. During this same period, Hinds also performed on stage in Ireland with the Abbey Theatre, the Field Day Theatre Company, the Druid Theatre, the Lyric Players' Theatre and at the Project Arts Centre. In 1987, he was cast by Peter Brook in The Mahabharata, a six-hour theatre piece that toured the world, and he also featured in its 1989 film version. Hinds almost missed the casting call in Paris due to difficulties renewing his Irish passport. In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He appeared in the title role of the RSC's 1993 production of Richard III, directed by Sam Mendes; Mendes turned to Hinds as a last minute replacement for an injured Simon Russell Beale. Hinds gained his most popular recognition as a stage actor for his performance as Larry in the London and Broadway productions of Patrick Marber's Tony Award-nominated play Closer. In 1999, Hinds was awarded both the Theatre World Award for Best Debut in New York and the Outer Critics Circle Award for Special Achievement (Best Ensemble Cast Performance) for his work in Closer. He was on stage in 2001 in The Yalta Game by Brian Friel at Dublin's Gate Theatre. He appeared on Broadway in The Seafarer by Conor McPherson, which ran at the Booth Theatre from December 2007 through March 2008. In February 2009 Hinds took the leading role of General Sergei Kotov in Burnt by the Sun by Peter Flannery at London's National Theatre. Hinds returned to the stage later in 2009 with a role in Conor McPherson's play The Birds, which opened at Dublin's Gate Theatre in September 2009. Hinds made his feature film debut in John Boorman's Excalibur (1981). He played Captain Frederick Wentworth in Jane Austen's Persuasion (1995), Jonathan Reiss in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), John Traynor in Veronica Guerin (2003), and Firmin in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera (2004). Hinds also played Carl, a cover-up professional assisting a group of assassins, in Steven Spielberg's political thriller, Munich (2005). In 2006, he appeared in Michael Mann's film adaptation of the 80's television show, Miami Vice, and as Herod the Great in The Nativity Story. In the 2006 film Amazing Grace, Hinds portrayed Sir Banastre Tarleton, one of the chief opponents of abolition of the slave trade in parliament. He starred in Margot at the Wedding, alongside Nicole Kidman, Jack Black and Jennifer Jason Leigh, in a drama-comedy about family secrets and relationships. He also appeared in There Will Be Blood (2007) directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. On television, Hinds portrayed Gaius Julius Caesar in the first season of BBC/HBO's series, Rome (2006). He has also been featured in a number of made-for-television films, including the role of Michael Henchard in Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge (2004), for which he received the Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series. Additional television performances include Edward Parker-Jones in the crime drama series Prime Suspect 3 (1993), Abel Mason in Dame Catherine Cookson's The Man Who Cried (1993), Jim Browner in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes episode The Cardboard Box (1994), Fyodor Glazunov in the science fiction miniseries Cold Lazarus (1996), Edward Rochester in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1997), the Knight Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert in Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1997) and a portrayal of the French existentialist Albert Camus in Broken Morning (2003). Hinds lives in Paris with his long-time partner, Hélène Patarot; they met in 1987 while in the cast of Peter Brook's production of The Mahabharata. They have a daughter, Aoife, born in 1991.

an enquiry into the nature and causes of wealth of nations,"['', 'A first edition of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations was rediscovered in the library of the Dutch House of Representatives. This fundamental work in classical economics is highly collectible, much admired and a symbol of liberalism. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, generally referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations, is the magnum opus of the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith (1723-1790). It was first published in 1776 and is now considered as the first modern work in economics. The work has roots in both the Scottish Enlightenment and the early stages of the Industrial Revolution. Smith explored concepts such as free market and the division of labor, and explained how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. The Wealth of Nations is the second most cited work in the social sciences, after Karl Marx’\xa0Das Kapital. The irony of history is that the rediscovered copy in the Dutch House of Representatives was hidden on a shelf behind a four volume set of\xa0Das Kapital. It was as if somebody had laid it there on purpose to safeguard it from greedy eyes of shady book collectors. The downside of course, was that eventually everybody had forgotten that it existed. The copy turned up in the process of an ongoing project on the Historical Collection of the library of the\xa0House of Representatives. In this project, the old books from the library will be cataloged, restored and used for promotional and educational purposes. The copy is bound in a contemporary English leather binding with panel design. The provenance of the book is not known, but an old library stamp suggests that it must have been in the library since at least the late nineteenth century. Over the centuries, the book was cited by hundreds of parliamentarians, as can be seen in the minutes of the House. This is what connects it to the early stages of Dutch parliamentary history.

The Gnadenhutten massacre, also known as the Moravian massacre, was the killing of 96 Christian Delaware by colonial White American militia from Pennsylvania on March 8, 1782 at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, Ohio during the American Revolutionary War.[2] More than a century later, President Theodore Roosevelt would call the massacre “a stain on the frontier character that time cannot wash away”.[3] Born on 22 August 1882 in Paris, Raymonde Deroche was the daughter of a plumber. She had a fondness for sports as a child, as well as for motorcycles and automobiles when she was older. As a young woman she became an actress and used the stage name “Raymonde de Laroche”. Inspired by Wilbur Wright’s 1908 demonstrations of powered flight in Paris and being personally acquainted with several aviators, including artist-turned-aviator Léon Delagrange, who was reputed to be the father of her son André, de Laroche determined to take up flying for herself.[1]:9–10 After the Socialist Party of America organized a Women’s Day on February 28, 1909, in New York, the 1910 International Socialist Woman’s Conference suggested a Women’s Day be held annually. After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the United Nations. Today, International Women’s Day is a public holiday in some countries and largely ignored elsewhere.[4] In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood. Aiken accumulated honorary degrees at the University of Wisconsin, Wayne State[which?] and Technische Hochschule, Darmstadt. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1947.[7] He received the University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Engineering Engineers Day Award in 1958, the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1964, the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1964, and the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Edison Medal in 1970 “For a meritorious career of pioneering contributions to the development and application of large-scale digital computers and important contributions to education in the digital computer field.” Howard Aiken was also a Commander in the United States Navy Reserve.[5] After he retired at age 60 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Aiken continued his contributions to technology. He founded Howard Aiken Industries Incorporated, which was a consulting firm that helped failing businesses recover. During his years in Florida, he joined the University of Miami as a Distinguished Professor of Information. In addition, Aiken became a consultant for companies such as Lockheed Martin and Monsanto. On March 14, 1973, Aiken died during a consulting trip to St. Louis, Missouri .[9] His widow, Mary, died in 2013. One of the first programs to run on the Mark I was initiated on 29 March 1944[2] by John von Neumann. At that time, von Neumann was working on the Manhattan project, and needed to determine whether implosion was a viable choice to detonate the atomic bomb that would be used a year later. The Mark I also computed and printed mathematical tables, which had been the initial goal of British inventor Charles Babbage for his “analytical engine”. The Mark I was disassembled in 1959, but portions of it are displayed in the Science Center as part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. Other sections of the original machine were transferred to IBM and the Smithsonian Institution. She was a successful novelist, poet, and journalist, as well as a prolific letter writer and diarist. She published more than a dozen collections of poetry during her lifetime and 13 novels.

the charge on an ion is the same as the of that ion,"['We can divide the ions into two categories: cation and anion, based on the charge they bear. However, they both get generated from a neutral atom. The cations consist of more positively charged protons than that of negative electrons. And due to this extra positivity, they have a positive charge. In contrast, the anions are negatively charged as they possess more electrons than protons. The cations being positively charged, tend to move towards the negative electrode. Whereas, the positive electrodes attract the negatively charged anion. Most of the time, the metals are eager to donate the valence electrons, so as to stabilize their octet. Thus, they are considered electropositive. And have a tendency to form a cation. Oppositely, the non-metals are electronegative. And thus, they accept the electrons to fulfil their octet. Therefore, they tend to make anion. In this context, we will learn the primary differences between the cation and anion in detail. We can define ions as “A charged particles due to an unequal number of protons and electrons. Our earth comprises several different elements exiting in various forms. However, these elements aren’t stable much in their atomic state. The atoms are neutral bodies with no charges. In order to stabilize themselves and match the stability of noble elements, they transform into an ionic state. The atom either gives out or takes in the electron to become an ion. Moreover, the negative and positive charges generated have attraction between them. This leads to the formation of compounds with ionic bonds. The ions with permanent positive charges are cations. They have more positive protons than that of negative electrons. Thus the overall charge of the atom becomes positive. We refer to this as a cationic atom. Every atom in this universe wants to stabilize. In order to do so, the electropositive atoms donate their valence electrons. In this way, they balance and match E.C. of the nearest noble gas. The atom removes the electrons with a lower affinity. Due to this removal of electrons number of electrons reduces thereby decreasing the negative charge. In contrast, the number of protons rises which elevates the positive charge of the atom. As soon as this happens, the neutral atom transforms into a cation. An electropositive atom will search for a receiver that is devoid of electrons and will donate its electrons to it. Generally, this character is present in metals. They tend to give electrons and gain a positive charge. The negative electrode attracts the cations towards itself as the electricity passes during the electrolysis reaction. We will learn the formation of the cation with the help of an example. In order to stabilize its octet, the sodium atom gives away the 1 electron of its valence shell. As the atom has a lower affinity to that electron, it readily detaches and moves to the electronegative one. As soon as this happens, the sodium remains with 10 electrons and 11 protons. Due to the higher number of positive charges, the sodium will become cation. Now its E.C. will change as: Another example is magnesium with E.C. as: It is also an electropositive element. And thus, it donates two of its valence shell electrons to become a cation. After becoming a cation its E.C. will change as: The ions that possess a negative charge are anions. In cases, where the atom is trying to stabilize itself by gaining electrons to complete the octet. A neutral atom becomes an anion when it attracts one or two electrons to its valence orbit. Due to the gain of extra electrons, the number of negative charges increases. In contrast, the number of protons becomes less thereby lowering the positive charge. Due to the elevation in the negative charge, the neutral atom transforms to anion. In order to gain the electrons, there should be a donor who is willing to donate the electrons. If the donor atom will have a lesser affinity towards some electrons, it will pass these electrons to others. And will become stable. The elements which tend to produce an anion are referred to as electronegative elements. This is because they always have a scope to add electrons in the valence orbit to attain stability. Non-metals being electronegative readily produce anions. anions displace towards the positively charges electrode. Note: It is not always necessary that the non-metals form anion only. There are certain exceptions like NH4+. It has no metallic element but still, it is cationic. Similarly, carbon which is considered a non-metal can serve both the role of cation and anion as the requirement. We will understand the formation of the anion with the help of examples. It is a non-metal with an electronegative tendency. Thereby is ready to attract 1 electron to achieve the nearest noble gas configuration. It possesses 7 electrons in its outermost shell, thus it needs three electrons to stabilize its octet. As soon as, it attracts the 3 electrons to the valence orbit, it will transform into an anion. This is chloride ion with E.C. as: Another example can be seen of fluorine. It is also a non-metal with electronic configuration: Here, also the fluorine requires only one electron to fulfil its valence orbit and gain the E.C. of the nearest noble gas. Cation and anion are among the common words of chemistry. But if we go in-depth, there are many other similar terms too, like neutrons, protons, electrons. These are the subatomic particles of an atom, which is the most tin particle and is invisible to the naked eyes. Ions are formed of such atoms or groups of atoms. As we discussed above that the ion tends to be stable if it has an equal number of protons and electrons, but when it loses or gains the protons or electrons, it gains the positive or negative charge and is said as cations or anions. In this article, we discussed the ions differentiated by the net charge held by them. Your email address will not be published.

It is designed such that it is possible to manage  windows using only a  keyboard, without needing a  mouse. It is the successor of PWM and is written by the same author, Tuomo Valkonen. Since the first release of Ion in the summer 2000, similar alternative window management ideas have begun to show in other new window managers:  Larswm,  ratpoison,  StumpWM,  wmii,  xmonad and  dwm. First versions of Ion were released under the  Artistic License, Ion2 and the development versions of Ion3 were released under the  GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). However, the first release candidate of Ion3 included a license change to a custom license based on the LGPL (specifically modified versions must not use the name ion). Since version 2, Ion has been scriptable in  Lua. As of September 17, 2009, Valkonen states he is unlikely to continue development of Ion by himself. The official home page went off-line early 2010. A fork,  Notion, is being actively maintained. In physics and chemistry, an  ion is an atom or group of atoms with a net electric charge. In  Plato\'s Ion (; )  Socrates discusses with Ion, a professional  rhapsode who also lectures on  Homer, the question of whether the rhapsode, a performer of poetry, gives his performance on account of his skill and knowledge or by virtue of divine possession. It is one of the shortest of Plato\'s dialogues. Ion (; , Iōn) is an ancient Greek play by  Euripides, thought to be written between 414 and 412 BC. It follows the orphan  Ion in the discovery of his origins. Ion (Voletta Todd) is a fictional  supervillain character appearing in  American comic books published by  Marvel Comics. Ion is a  Greek chocolate brand. Although the first chocolate recipe has been manufactured since 1927, the company was formally incorporated in 1930. The main factory is located in  Neo Faliro  Pireaus. Over the years, Ion introduced other chocolate varieties confectionery products such as croissants and spreadable chocolate. However, it is best known for its almond milk chocolate variety. The company has grown to be one of Greece’s 50 largest companies with annual sales of over €100 million. Ion is a fictional character, a  DC Comics  superhero. Created by writer  Judd Winick and artist  Dale Eaglesham for  Green Lantern vol. 3 #142, Ion was devised as the new superhero identity for Green Lantern protagonist  Kyle Rayner. It was later revealed to be able to form  mutualism with a host, bestowing its power to a host willingly. This followed a similar  retcon as  Parallax, originally the new supervillain alias of  Hal Jordan, which was revealed to be a parasitic embodiment of fear in the 2004–2005 miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth. The Ion is an  electropneumatic  paintball  marker manufactured by  Smart Parts. At the time of its release, the Ion was the first fully electropneumatic marker to target entry-level players, at a  price point previously inhabited only by  Spyders and other mechanical blowbacks. The Ion has generally been credited with making high-rate-of-fire electropneumatic markers available to the masses, at a time when electropneumatic markers were considered out of reach of most casual or budget players. The original Ion was released in 2005, and soon soared in popularity, though it was often criticized for being difficult to disassemble and service. Smart Parts addressed these concerns in 2007 with the release of the Ion XE, which features the ability to remove the bolt from the back of the marker. . Ion is a masculine  given name. The name form in English corresponds to two different and unrelated names from different original languages. The first name is the  Greek,, Iōn, after the mythical founder of the  Ionians; the modern (demotic) Greek equivalent of the name is Ionas. The source of this is the Hebrew  Yavan, alternatively transliterated as ι-o-ν (Yut Vav/digamma Nun), with each letter corresponding to its appropriate counterpart. The second name is the  Romanian Ion which is equivalent to the  English name  John and has the same  etymology as ""Jon"", tracing back the  Hebrew name Johanan; Ion can also be a  surname in Romanian. Another variant is  Ioan. A common diminutive is  Ionel. Its female form is  Ioana. The surname  Ionescu derives from Ion. An ion  is an  atom or a  molecule in which the total number of  electrons is not equal to the total number of  protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative  electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via  ionization. In chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a net positive charge and is known as a  cation. If an atom gains electrons, it has a net negative charge and is known as an  anion. Ions consisting of only a single atom are atomic or  monatomic ions; if they consist of two or more atoms, they are  molecular or  polyatomic ions. Because of their electric charges, cations and anions attract each other and readily form  ionic compounds, such as  salts. In the case of physical ionization of a medium, such as a gas, what are known as ""ion pairs"" are created by ion impact, and each pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion. The Illinois Observing Nanosatellite (ION) is the first  CubeSat mission developed by the students of  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The satellite was lost in the failure of the  Dnepr launch on 26 July 2006. Completed in April 2005 as a part of the Illinois Tiny Satellite Initiative, the satellite took almost four years to be designed, built and tested by an interdisciplinary team of student engineers. The payloads included a photometer, a micro-thruster and a camera. Ion (born in 1984), is an Italian rapper and actor, born from a  Tunisian mother and a  Congolese father. He sings in Italian and French. Ion is a  data serialization language developed by  Amazon. It may be represented by either a human-readable text form or a compact binary form. The text form is a super set of  JSON, meaning any valid JSON document is also a valid Ion document. According to  Greek mythology, Ion (; , gen.: Ἴωνος) was the illegitimate child of  Creüsa, daughter of  Erechtheus and wife of  Xuthus. Creusa conceived Ion with  Apollo then she abandoned the child. Apollo asked  Hermes to take Ion from his cradle. Ion was saved (and raised) by a priestess of the  Delphic Oracle. Later, Xuthus was informed by the oracle that the first person he met when leaving the oracle would be his son, and this person was Ion. He interpreted it to mean that he had fathered Ion, when, in fact, Apollo was giving him Ion as an adoptive son. Creusa was planning on killing Ion due to her jealousy that Xuthus had a son while she was still childless. At the same time, Ion was planning on doing harm to Creusa. In the end, Creusa found out that Ion was her child, and only Xuthus\' adopted child. This is the story told in the tragedy  Ion by  Euripides. In the other accounts, Ion was the founder of  Helike (the modern  Eliki) in  Achaea. Ion was the son of  Xuthus (rather than Apollo) who was brought to the area during the reign of king  Selinus. He married the girl named  Helike who succeeded to the throne. He built the city of Eliki after the name of his wife, and made it the capital of the kingdom. Later he took an expedition against  Eleusis (now Elefsina) with the help of the  Athenian and in the battle he was killed near Eleusis. Ion was also believed to have founded a primary tribe of Greece, the  Ionians. He has often been identified with the  Javan mentioned in the  Hebrew Bible. The earlier Greek form of the name was  *Ἰάϝων ""Iáwōn"", which, with the loss of the digamma, later became Ἰάων Iáōn, or plural Iáones, as seen in epic poetry. In addition,  Dionysius Periegetes ver. 416 mentions a river in  Arcadia called Iaon. This river Iaon is further alluded to in Hesiod\'s Hymns of Callimachus, Hymn to Jupiter 22. This river has also been connected to the earlier forms of the name. The hostage ships themselves were accelerating forward, their dark shapes backlit by blue halos of ion glow.

All the other customers had been thrown hundreds of yards away in every direction, and the merchandise had exploded into its component ions, except for the alembic, which sat in the center of the circle shining like an atomic pile.

It recoiled freely against the thrust of ions accelerated to light speed, tumbling muzzle over cascabel to meet the shock wave plasma-driven in the opposite direction. A group of childless protectors had carved it out with solar mirrors and built into it a small life-support and controls system, a larger frozen-sleep chamber, a breeder atomic pile and generator, a dirigible ion drive, and an enormous cesium tank. There was no blaze of light as he blasted out of his parking orbit, just the invisible cloud of ions from the cesium engine. The ion exchange resin of the purification system, he knew, kept the radioactive particles in the nuclear coolant down to a minimum. In this multimillion-pound complex, tiny samples of water or carbon compounds arc placed at the heart of a cyclotron which fires vastly accelerated ion beams at them, creating very short-lived isotopes. It was supposed to have had its name from Ellops, the Son of Ion, who was the brother of Cothus.

In other words, when an atom loses or gains one or more electrons it turns into a charged particle which is known as an ion. Let us understand an atom to have a clear idea of how ions are formed. Everything is made up of matter and an atom is the smallest particle of the matter, so everything in the universe is made of atoms. An atom is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons are contained in the nucleus of the atom and electrons revolve around the nucleus. Protons are positively charged particles, they carry the positive charge and electrons are negatively charged particles, they carry the negative charge. Neutrons are neutral, they don?t carry any charge. An atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. So, when an atom gains one or more electrons, it has more electrons than protons so it acquires the negative charge and is known as an anion (ion with a negative charge). Similarly, when an atom loses electrons, it has more protons than electrons which gives it a net positive charge and is known as a cation (ion with a positive charge). Let us see how cation differs from anion! It is a positively charged Ion. It is formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. An atom has an equal number of protons and electrons when it loses electrons, the protons outnumber the number of electrons which gives it a net positive charge. A cation is smaller in size than its parent atom as with the decrease in the number of electrons the repulsive power of electron is reduced and the power of protons to attract the electrons towards the nucleus increases which reduces the radius of the cation. The positive charge of the cation is represented by the positive (+) sign. For example, Na+ indicates the cation has one electron less than the protons; similarly a cation with '+3' charge has three electrons less than the total number of protons. Cations travel towards the cathode (negative electrode) during electrolysis and they are generally formed by metal atoms in an attempt to acquire the noble gas configuration, e.g. the formation of a hydrogen ion from a hydrogen atom: H ? e- → H+ It is a negatively charged Ion. It is formed when an atom gains one or more electrons. An atom has an equal number of protons and electrons, so when it gains electrons the number of electrons exceeds the number of protons which gives it a net negative charge. An anion is larger in size than its parent atom as with the increase in the number electrons, the electron-electron repulsion increases and repels electrons further apart which increases the radius of the anion. The negative charge of the anion is represented by the negative (-) sign. For example, Cl- indicates that it has one electron more than the total number of protons; similarly an anion S2- has two electrons more than the total number of protons. Anions travel towards the anode (positive electrode) during electrolysis and they are generally formed by non-metal atoms in order to acquire noble gas configuration, e.g. the formation of an iodine anion from an iodine atom: I + e- → I- .Net JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

for much of history the inability to detect stellar parallax was interpreted to mean that,"['', 'This presentation below is a follow-up to a similar presentation given 13 years ago.  That previous presentation focused on how well Book of Mormon claims relative to Science and Archaeology issues were faring.  Horses, steel, cement, etc. Those scholars highlighted Book of Mormon claims from 1830 to today.  And showed which claims were confirmed, trending, or still unconfirmed. 1830 – 1844:  Critics mentioned 89 anachronisms from 1830 -1844.  Only 5 of the 89 had been confirmed before Joseph Smith died. 1845 – 1965:   sixty-one new criticisms had been added since 1844.  The total number of anachronisms now totaled 150 by 1965.   However, 22 were confirmed, 5 were trending, and 123 were still unconfirmed. 1966 – present:  55 new criticisms, bringing grand total to 205 Book of Mormon anachronisms.  At this point, 141 are confirmed, 26 are trending, and 38 are unconfirmed. 70% have been confirmed.   81% are confirmed or trending.   19% are unconfirmed. It’s best to be patient. Jeff discusses several issues:  the flood, Jonah & the whale, Genesis’ creation account, and others. The Bible is similar to a library.  Lots of books there.  Lots of books from different genres or styles there.  Not all the books are historical non-fiction.  Same with the Old Testament. Some in the Old Testament is poetry.  Some is parable.  Some is absolute history.  But not all is absolutely historical. Did the Good Samaritan story really happen in the New Testament?  Probably not. Did Jonah really get swallowed by and remain in the belly of the whale?  For three days? Almost certainly not. William Lane Craig rightfully points out that Catholic scholar, St. Augustine of Hippo who lived from 354-430, articulated that creation wasn’t necessarily 6000 years ago.\xa0 Neither did Augustine required special creation with God “poofing” Adam into existence. This flexible conception of creation arose well before Science revealed the age of the earth and universe. Without intervention by God, Craig argues life wouldn’t have arisen.\xa0 Life simply would have been so improbable the Earth would have first been swallowed up by our dying Sun before life would have had a chance to develop. Latter-day Saints don’t believe in creation ex nihilo.\xa0 We believe in eternal matter and eternal spirits.\xa0 We believe God is the father of our spirits.\xa0 \xa0When men developed from their ancestors, at this point God may have given the first humans their spirits. We simply don’t know how God was involved.\xa0 We welcome findings of scientists that demonstrate what occurred.\xa0 But we should all recognize there are limits to what Science can tell us.\xa0 We don’t need to adopt Scientism.\xa0 Instead, we should marry the best of Science and our faith. Interestingly, Joseph, Hyrum, and Orson Hyde believed that people lived before Adam.  They discussed the use of the word “replenish”.  People must have predated Adam. I recently completed my Google Slides presentation here. Science isn’t in conflict with religion.\xa0 Instead, the problem is with Scientism: the irrational believe that Science is the only source of truth. Scientism (and not Science) conflicts with religion and many other fields. Insightful article at Newsweek. Many atheists think that their atheism is the product of rational thinking. They use arguments such as “I don’t believe in God, I believe in science” to explain that evidence and logic, rather than supernatural belief and dogma, underpin their thinking. But just because you believe in evidence-based, scientific research—which is subject to strict checks and procedures—doesn’t mean that your mind works in the same way. When you ask atheists about why they became atheists (as I do for a living), they often point to eureka moments when they came to realize that religion simply doesn’t make sense. Oddly perhaps, many religious people\xa0actually take a similar view of atheism. This comes out when theologians and other theists speculate that it must be rather sad to be an atheist, lacking (as they think atheists do) so much of the philosophical, ethical, mythical and aesthetic fulfillments that religious people have access to—stuck in a cold world of rationality only. The problem that any rational thinker needs to tackle, though, is that\xa0the science\xa0increasingly shows that atheists are no more rational than theists. Indeed, atheists are just as susceptible as the next person to “group-think” and other non-rational forms of cognition. For example, religious and nonreligious people alike can end up following charismatic individuals without questioning them. And our minds often\xa0prefer righteousness over truth, as the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has explored. Even atheist beliefs themselves have much less to do with rational inquiry than atheists often think. We now know, for example, that nonreligious children of religious parents cast off their beliefs for reasons that have little to do with intellectual reasoning. The\xa0latest cognitive research\xa0shows that the decisive factor is learning from what parents do rather than from what they say. So if a parent says that they’re Christian, but they’ve fallen out of the habit of doing the things they say should matter—such as praying or going to church—their kids simply don’t buy the idea that religion makes sense. This is perfectly rational in a sense, but children aren’t processing this on a cognitive level. Throughout our evolutionary history, humans have often lacked the time to scrutinize and weigh up the evidence—needing to make quick assessments. That means that children to some extent just absorb the crucial information, which in this case is that religious belief doesn’t appear to matter in the way that parents are saying it does. Even older children and adolescents who actually ponder the topic of religion may not be approaching it as independently as they think.\xa0Emerging research\xa0is demonstrating that atheist parents (and others) pass on their beliefs to their children in a similar way to religious parents—through sharing their culture as much as their arguments. Some parents take the view that their children should\xa0choose their beliefs for themselves, but what they then do is pass on certain ways of thinking about religion, like the idea that religion is a matter of choice rather than divine truth. It’s not surprising that almost all of these children—95%—end up\xa0“choosing” to be atheist. But are atheists more likely to embrace science than religious people? Many belief systems can be more or less closely integrated with scientific knowledge. Some belief systems are openly critical of science, and think it has far too much sway over our lives, while other belief systems are hugely concerned to learn about and respond to scientific knowledge. But this difference doesn’t neatly map onto whether you are religious or not.\xa0Some Protestant traditions, for example, see rationality or scientific thinking as central to their religious lives. Meanwhile, a new generation of\xa0postmodern atheists\xa0highlight the limits of human knowledge, and see scientific knowledge as hugely limited, problematic even, especially when it comes to existential and ethical questions. These atheists might, for example, follow thinkers like\xa0Charles Baudelaire\xa0in the view that true knowledge is only found in artistic expression. And while many atheists do like to think of themselves as pro-science, science and technology itself can sometimes be the basis of religious thinking or beliefs, or something very much like it. For example, the rise of the\xa0transhumanist movement, which centers on the belief that humans can and should transcend their current natural state and limitations through the use of technology, is an example of how technological innovation is driving the emergence of\xa0new movements that have much in common with religiosity. Even for those atheists skeptical of transhumanism, the role of science isn’t only about rationality—it can provide the philosophical, ethical, mythical and aesthetic fulfillments that religious beliefs do for others. The science of the biological world, for example, is much more than a topic of intellectual curiosity—for some atheists,\xa0it provides meaning and comfort\xa0in much the same way that belief in God can for theists. Psychologists show that belief in science\xa0increases in the face of stress and existential anxiety, just as religious beliefs intensify for theists in these situations. Clearly, the idea that being atheist is down to rationality alone is\xa0starting to look distinctly irrational. But the good news for all concerned is that rationality is overrated. Human ingenuity rests on a lot more than rational thinking. As Haidt says of “the righteous mind”, we are actually “designed to ‘do’ morality”—even if we’re not doing it in the rational way we think we are. The ability to make quick decisions, follow our passions and act on intuition are also important human qualities and crucial for our success. It is helpful that we have invented something that, unlike our minds, is rational and evidence-based: science. When we need proper evidence, science can very often provide it—as long as the topic is testable. Importantly, the scientific evidence does not tend to support the view that atheism is about rational thought and theism is about existential fulfillments. The truth is that humans are not like science—none of us get by without irrational action, nor without sources of existential meaning and comfort. Fortunately, though, nobody has to.” “If scripture cannot err, certain of its interpreters and commentators can and do so in many ways.”\xa0 – Galileo Major issues:\xa0 unassailable Greek astronomy, politics within the church and Italian academics, inability to measure stellar parallax, flawed interpretations of scripture (Joshua 10:12: stand still O sun;\xa0 Psalm 93:1: thou hast fixed the earth, immovable and firm), recent outburst of the Reformation, and more. Galileo had strong suspicions the Sun was the center, but couldn’t prove it.\xa0 This wasn’t Science vs. Religion, but Heretic vs. Orthodoxy. Explanation of early Greek astronomy here. Copernicus was a smart fellow.\xa0 But his ideas needed lots of work to refine.\xa0 The complete adoption of his theory didn’t occur for a few centuries, however. A few quotes below (from The Galileo Controversy) to demonstrate that the Roman Catholic Church wasn’t opposed to Science or Copernicus.\xa0 In fact, interestingly, Protestant Martin Luther was opposed to Copernicus’ model: “Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated his most famous work,\xa0On the Revolution of the Celestial Orbs, in which he gave an excellent account of heliocentricism, to Pope Paul III. Copernicus entrusted this work to Andreas Osiander, a Lutheran clergyman who knew that Protestant reaction to it would be negative, since Martin Luther seemed to have condemned the new theory, and, as a result, the book would be condemned.” “Anti-Catholics often cite the Galileo case as an example of the Church refusing to abandon outdated or incorrect teaching, and clinging to a “tradition.” They fail to realize that the judges who presided over Galileo’s case were not the only people who held to a geocentric view of the universe. It was the received view among\xa0scientists\xa0at the time. Centuries earlier, Aristotle had refuted heliocentricism, and by Galileo’s time, nearly every major thinker subscribed to a geocentric view. Copernicus refrained from publishing his heliocentric theory for some time, not out of fear of censure from the Church\xa0but out of fear of ridicule from his colleagues.” Image below is from his own writings.\xa0 Sol means sun. A little more context with Brahe mentioned at the very bottom.\xa0 Scientists were not convinced by Galileo.\xa0 Parallax shifts will be discussed at length further below: “Many people wrongly believe Galileo proved heliocentricism. He could not answer the strongest argument against it, which had been made nearly two thousand years earlier by Aristotle: If heliocentrism were true, then there would be observable parallax shifts in the stars’ positions as the earth moved in its orbit around the sun. “However, given the technology of Galileo’s time, no such shifts in their positions could be observed. It would require more sensitive measuring equipment than was available in Galileo’s day to document the existence of these shifts, given the stars’ great distance. Until then, the available evidence suggested that the stars were fixed in their positions relative to the earth, and, thus, that the earth and the stars were not moving in space—only the sun, moon, and planets were.” “Stellar parallax is so small (as to be unobservable until the 19th century) that its apparent absence was used as a scientific argument against heliocentrism during the modern age. It is clear from\xa0Euclid‘s\xa0geometry\xa0that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of\xa0Tycho Brahe‘s principal objections to\xa0Copernican heliocentrism\xa0that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of Saturn and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars). James Bradley\xa0first tried to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his\xa0telescope, but he instead discovered the\xa0aberration of light\xa0and the\xa0nutation\xa0of Earth’s axis, and catalogued 3222 stars.” Thus Galileo did not prove the theory by the Aristotelian standards of science in his day. In his\xa0Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\xa0and other documents, Galileo claimed that the Copernican theory had the “sensible demonstrations” needed according to Aristotelian science, but most knew that such demonstrations were not yet forthcoming. Most astronomers in that day were not convinced of the great distance of the stars that the Copernican theory required to account for the absence of observable parallax shifts. This is one of the main reasons why the respected astronomer Tycho Brahe refused to adopt Copernicus fully.” Kepler was an assistant to Brahe, and by studying Brahe’s calculations, made improvements to the solar model.\xa0 Kepler was a German Protestant, and was disappointed his fellow Protestants resisted his work. “Ten years prior to Galileo, Johannes Kepler published a heliocentric work that expanded on Copernicus’ work. As a result, Kepler also found opposition among his fellow Protestants for his heliocentric views and found a welcome reception among some Jesuits who were known for their scientific achievements.” Along came Galileo around the time of Kepler.\xa0 Galileo’s greatest contributions arose from his much-improved telescope. This slide below highlights challenges Galileo faced. Later videos will show that Galileo’s approach didn’t always help his relationship with the Church.\xa0 \xa0 He was brash, outspoken, and lacked tact. Also not mentioned in this slide is this fact:\xa0 the best parts of his theory — presented as fact when all the evidence wasn’t in — weren’t produced till his years under house arrest (long after his 2 trials). This article — The Galileo Controversy — written by Catholic defenders, explains the Galileo controversy from their perspective. “Galileo could have safely proposed heliocentricism as a theory or a method to more simply account for the planets’ motions. His problem arose when he stopped proposing it as a scientific theory and began proclaiming it as truth, though there was no conclusive proof of it at the time. Even so, Galileo would not have been in so much trouble if he had chosen to stay within the realm of science and out of the realm of theology. But, despite his friends’ warnings, he insisted on moving the debate onto theological grounds. In 1614, Galileo felt compelled to answer the charge that this “new science” was contrary to certain Scripture passages. His opponents pointed to Bible passages with statements like, “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed . . .” (Josh. 10:13). This is not an isolated occurrence. Psalms 93 and 104 and Ecclesiastes 1:5 also speak of celestial motion and terrestrial stability. A literalistic reading of these passages would have to be abandoned if the heliocentric theory were adopted. Yet this should not have posed a problem. As Augustine put it, “One does\xa0not\xa0read in the Gospel that the Lord said: ‘I will send you the Paraclete who will teach you about the course of the sun and moon.’ For he willed to make them Christians, not mathematicians.” Following Augustine’s example, Galileo urged caution in not interpreting these biblical statements too literally.” During this period, personal interpretation of Scripture was a sensitive subject. In the early 1600s, the Church had just been through the Reformation experience, and one of the chief quarrels with Protestants was over individual interpretation of the Bible. Theologians were not prepared to entertain the heliocentric theory based on a layman’s interpretation. Yet Galileo insisted on moving the debate into a theological realm. There is little question that if Galileo had kept the discussion within the accepted boundaries of astronomy (i.e., predicting planetary motions) and had not claimed physical truth for the heliocentric theory, the issue would not have escalated to the point it did. After all, he had not proved the new theory beyond reasonable doubt.” The process to determine the sun was the center took many steps and generations of scientists to understand.\xa0 A Greek interpretation of scripture (see model above) was understood to mean the earth never moved. Among other things, this video points out that we actually don’t revolve around the sun.\xa0 Instead, we revolve around the center of mass of the solar system.\xa0 The more complete picture — and we’re still learning all the time — took long after Galileo to see. The Catholic Church didn’t accept the sun as center till 1758.\xa0 When Newton fully demonstrated this mathematically. Galileo was extremely prolific.\xa0 His contributions to Science were enormous! In additional to other expected details, this video explains that Galileo was brash and aggressive.\xa0 Galileo could have been more diplomatic and tactful. The Pope requested before Galileo publish his findings, Galileo allow the Pope to contribute to the publication.\xa0 Galileo, instead, mocked what the Pope’s position was (earth at center). This scholar shows that Galileo lacked evidence, according to other scientists of his own time.\xa0 Parallax and other arguments (earth didn’t appear to be flying through space) were against him. He also mentions that Copernicus’ claims — 50 years before Galileo — wasn’t controversial.\xa0 But, by the time of Galileo, the Reformation had erupted.\xa0 The Church was worried about people interpreting scripture for himself. This below video shares that scientists were divided in Galileo’s day.\xa0 Galileo himself didn’t have sufficient evidence to fully convince others and Church leaders. Among some of Galileo’s bad ideas (of course, he had many good ones) was that the waves of the ocean were caused by the Earth’s rotation.\xa0 Galileo presented his research in Italian, not Latin.\xa0 That offended many.\xa0 Galileo mocked the Ptolemaic system (earth-centered) crowd of clergy and opposing scientists.\xa0 Galileo attacked fellow scientists, the clergy, and the Pope, despite not having sufficient evidence to prove his theory. This video quotes a Catholic leader, Bishop Robert Bellarmine, who said that if evidence was presented the Church would change its interpretation.\xa0 But Galileo’s thesis lacked sufficient evidence.\xa0 He was teaching as fact what he couldn’t prove as fact. “The Council [of Trent] prohibits interpreting Scripture against the common consensus of the Holy Fathers; and if Your Paternity wants to read not only the Holy Fathers, but also the modern commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Joshua, you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed, and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world. I say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the center of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand them, than that what is demonstrated is false. But I will not believe that there is such a demonstration, until it is shown me. Nor is it the same to demonstrate that by supposing the sun to be at the center and the earth in heaven one can\xa0save the appearances, and to demonstrate that in truth the sun is at the center and the earth in heaven; for I believe the first demonstration may be available, but I have very great doubts about the second, and in case of doubt one must not abandon the Holy Scripture as interpreted by the Holy Fathers. Further, Galielo had agreed a decade earlier to not teach his theory as fact.\xa0 Finally, most of Galileo’s work that we celebrate today took place while he was in house arrest. Usually, atheists today claim that the Galileo controversy was between Science and faith.\xa0 Not so simple.\xa0 This article — What were Galileo’s scientific and biblical conflicts with the Church? — points out: “It was not a simple conflict between science and religion, as usually portrayed. Rather it was a conflict between Copernican science and Aristotelian science which had become Church tradition.” Early Christian leaders found ways to absorb Greek philosophy and teachings into the scriptures.\xa0 Just as they did with other concepts, such as ex nihilo creation and God’s characteristics:\xa0 outside of space and time, immutable (not changing), impassible (no feeling or emotion), etc.\xa0 So, the same way the Trinity evolved from Greek philosophy, so did a earth-centered view of the Universe. “Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) believed the universe is finite and spherical with a stationary Earth at its center. Enclosing the whole universe is the sphere of the Prime Motion turned by the First Unmoved Mover. Inside that were transparent spheres containing fixed and unchanging stars, planets, moon and sun.[1] Aristotle was also a renowned philosopher. Clement and Origen (185-254 A.D.), both of\xa0Alexandria, sought to reconcile Greek wisdom (Aristotle’s thoughts in philosophy and sciences) with scriptural wisdom. Origen imagined separate literal, moral, and spiritual senses of Bible passages (expanded to five senses in Concordism today).[2] Van Bebber says, “This allegorical interpretation gave birth to a new brand of Christianity. Augustine (354-430 A.D.), although not as extreme as Clement or Origen, accepted this new approach. Through Augustine the mixing of philosophy, culture, and theology became inter-twined. And, since Catholic theology recognizes the traditions of the Church as equal in authority with written scripture, changing this trend became impossible. Eventually, the roots planted in Augustine took full bloom in Thomas Aquinas” (1224-1274 A.D.).[3] The Renaissance Period (1300-1600 A.D.), the rebirth of Greek philosophy, reinforced Aristotle’s philosophy and science, already embedded in Roman Catholic theology and tradition. The most serious scientific error was acceptance of an Earth-centered cosmos. But this error fit well in the man-centered theme of the Renaissance. Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543 A.D.) was a Renaissance man educated in the classics, law, theology, mathematics, metaphysics, languages, and\xa0astronomy. Copernicus developed a cosmology with the sun at the center, the Earth rotating about a polar axis, and the Earth and planets circling the sun, essentially as we know it today.[4] Galileo Galilei (1564-1642 A.D.) received a broad Renaissance education. Until 1610, when Galileo built his first telescope at age 46, he focused mainly on physics, not\xa0astronomy. He soon made discoveries which shook the foundations of the Aristotelian cosmos. He saw mountains, valleys and other features indicating change on the moon. He observed the motion of four of Jupiter’s moons, now referred to as the\xa0Galilean\xa0moons. No longer could scientists say that heavenly bodies revolve exclusively around the Earth. He also observed the phases of Venus, the only explanation of which is that Venus moves around the sun and not the Earth.” The Church had assumed the truth of Aristotle’s cosmology was rock solid.\xa0 Nobody had better answers for nearly 2000 years.\xa0 Along come Copernicus and Galileo.\xa0 The article further explains: “The primary problem, as introduced earlier, was that Aristotle’s science was going out of style; but the church was still attached to him. It could not make a distinction between Aristotle and Christian teachings; and in that era, there was no distinguishment or separation of science from philosophy. For the Church, if Aristotle was wrong, Christianity was wrong.[6] Another background factor in Galileo’s conflict with the Church was the influence of the Reformation. Because Martin Luther (1483-1546 A.D.) and the Protestant reformation (1517 A.D.) questioned Church authority, the Roman Church lost significant power and influence. It reacted with a list of literature forbidden to Catholics. Included were any writings challenging traditional Scripture interpretation.[7]” Galileo believed in the Roman Church.\xa0 However, he thought their interpretation of scripture must be wrong.\xa0 He knew what he saw in the heavens. “Excerpts from the letter to Madame Christina help to reveal Galileo’s view of Scripture and that of his predecessors. He writes, “I think in the first place that it is very pious to say and prudent to affirm that the Holy Bible can never speak untruth—whenever its true meaning is understood.”[10] He cited Copernicus in the same vein: “He [Copernicus] did not ignore the Bible, but he knew very well that if his doctrine were proved, then it could not contradict the Scripture when they were rightly understood”.[11] Galileo further quoted Augustine.\xa0 Augustine, centuries earlier, had shown that people often misinterpret what is in the Bible: He quotes Augustine relating true reason to Scriptural truth. “And in St. Augustine [in the seventh letter to Marcellinus] we read: ‘If anyone shall set the authority of Holy Writ against clear and manifest reason, he who does this knows not what he has undertaken; for he opposes to the truth not the meaning of the Bible, which is beyond his comprehension, but rather his own interpretation; not what is in the Bible, but what he has found in himself and imagines to be there’”[12] The Church had no problem with these solid orthodox views. Galileo was a man of faith as well as science. Another issue mentioned earlier relates to stellar parallax.\xa0 Galileo got some of the Science right.\xa0 But was incapable, due to technology, to demonstrate all that Church leaders wanted to see to become fully convinced. Parallax occurs during each revolution.\xa0 On one side of the sun (in July) stars appear in a certain position.\xa0 On the other side of the sun (in January) the stars appear in differing locations. Nobody in Gaileo’s day understand that stars were billions of miles away.\xa0 If the sun were at the center, the Church and most scholars argued, why didn’t the stars appear to shift, as you’d expect if the Earth rotated around the sun? So, partly because neither Galileo nor Copernicus could demonstrate parallax with stars — stellar parallax — the Church felt justified to retain the cosmology of Aristotle. This video shows that stellar parallax wasn’t properly understood till 1838 when Bessel made the first parallax measurements. “It is a good thing that the Church did not rush to embrace Galileo’s views, because it turned out that his ideas were not entirely correct, either. Galileo believed that the sun was not just the fixed center of the solar system but the fixed center of the universe. We now know that the sun is not the center of the universe and that it\xa0does\xa0move—it simply orbits the center of the galaxy rather than the earth. As more recent science has shown, both Galileo\xa0and\xa0his opponents were partly right and partly wrong. Galileo was right in asserting the mobility of the earth and wrong in asserting the immobility of the sun. His opponents were right in asserting the mobility of the sun and wrong in asserting the immobility of the earth. Had the Catholic Church rushed to endorse Galileo’s views—and there were many in the Church who were quite favorable to them—the Church would have embraced what modern science has disproved.” Those models failed the Scientific Method. Part of a model is to provide predictions on future observations. And a new model should provide better predictions that the current model. Copernicus and Galileo failed that test. They both portrayed the planetary orbits as perfect circles. As such the predictions of planetary events were even worse than the geocentric model. What Scientific journal today would even print any equivalently poor model, let alone claim that this new model is the only correct one. It wasn’t until Kepler came up with the elliptical model that the predictions equaled that of the current model, and Newton provided the explanation for why the elliptical model would be the true one. So yes, the Church acted correctly. Even down the extent that the Church had no problems with the heliocentric model, as long was it wasn’t presented as being definitive until it was proven by observational evidence to be so. Would any modern Science journal do anything different? BTW, Kepler, a Lutheran , was given a teaching position at the Catholic University of Prague and an appointment as court mathematician to the Catholic Emperor Rudolph II. Let’s start with this series of short, 5-minute videos from Prager University. 21 videos total are available in Prager’s Religion/Philosophy section.\xa0 Consider subscribing to this YouTube channel. Dennis Mark Prager is an American conservative and nationally syndicated radio talk show host, columnist, author, and public speaker. He’s also a believing Jew.\xa0 Of course, LDS people don’t share all specific beliefs with Dennis.\xa0 However, we do have much in common.\xa0 Including most of the following beliefs about God, evil, morality, free will, etc. Blake Ostler, an LDS attorney and philosopher, shares many of his insights relative to the nature of God in over 20 podcasts found here at “Exploring Mormon Thought”. One is linked below.\xa0 Please review all his others.\xa0 They’re awesome and insightful! Alvin Plantinga, perhaps the world’s leading religious philosopher, discusses the position that all religions can’t logically be simultaneously true.\xa0 Alvin is not LDS. John Lennox articulates the differences between faiths, especially between the 3 major monotheistic religions. Judaism believes Jesus died, but didn’t rise.\xa0 Islam believes Jesus didn’t die.\xa0 And Christianity believes Jesus both died and rose.\xa0 1 of these 3 (or none) is correct.\xa0 All 3 are not correct. Thoughtful Ravi discusses why he believes Christianity is the true faith. In my experience, the climate today with strident new atheists makes people who leave faith feel more supported, trendy, and smarter. It’s ridiculous, but seems to be the case. The atheists arguments are no different (and in many cases worse) than in C.S. Lewis’ day. Yet, most people have no idea. They usually haven’t gotten to the bottom of things till years into their journey at which time things look pretty bleak. Classical atheists were sad that God didn’t exist and owned that the outlook was completely miserable. New atheists are strangely glib and sometimes ecstatic in their claim that there’s no God. They seem to forget that — according to all previous atheists — life is bleak and meaningless in the absence of God. No ultimate meaning, despite finding meaning week to week in subjective and personal choices month to month. New atheism is a pop-cultural phenomenon. Richard Dawkins (perhaps the most famous atheist in the world today), outside the pop culture, is ridiculed by academics for his poor arguments and avoidance of past obstacles. But your cousin who left faith doesn’t understand any of this. He thinks he’s smarter than you, you dummie! I have an atheist/agnostic friend who used to be a full-on LDS-hating atheist. Now, after a few years of cooling down, kinda hopes for God, but still rails against the Church. He just can’t let go of his critical interpretations. Most (85%) of our doubts are emotional doubts. LDS critics often claim “all reputable” scientists or scholars say this or that in relation to the LDS Church.\xa0 Broad, sweeping claims.\xa0 Often lots of bravado and bluster. Absolutely no evidence for this. Absolutely no evidence for that. How could it be true when more and more faithful Latter-day Saints are doing Science.\xa0 The very Science the critics claim disproves the LDS Church. Science is simply a method to understand truth.\xa0 Mormons are good geologists, statisticians, chemists, and are distinguished in every field of Science.\xa0 How Mormons interpret data for their personal lives is unique.\xa0 So is the way in which life-long agnostics interpret non-scientific data. Experiments on bacterial genetics, plant growth, and other topics won’t prove or disprove God.\xa0 Won’t prove or disprove the Book of Abraham.\xa0 Nor the Book of Mormon.\xa0 Or a long list of issues. Science answers how.\xa0 Faith answers why. Quick summary:\xa0 Nope. Longer summary:\xa0 evaluate each specific critical claim in context.\xa0 When all relevant data is on the table “all scientists” don’t tend to agree and/or the argument is often itself flawed with biases. Let’s first consider what “all scientists” believe.\xa0 Scientists, like most academics, tend to be very secular. Many, many non-believers. Do non-believers believe in the Book of Mormon? Nope. Moreover, the individual critic frequently herself lacks a fundamental understanding of Science and how exactly Science would perform an experiment to unequivocally illuminate the question under discussion. To unequivocally prove the LDS Church, the Book of Mormon, or other topic is obviously false — contrary to many critics’ belief system — turns out to be quite challenging. In fact, it’s impossible. For example, a critic might say that no self-respecting scientist believes major battles with steel swords and wheeled, horse-driven chariots took place in Palmyra, NY around 400 AD.\xa0 And further, no archaeologists have found lots of steel blades, metal armor, and wheels in the ground. This is an example of a straw man.\xa0 I and every LDS scientist would agree.\xa0 Yet, there’s more nuance to this situation than you may initially appreciate. 1) Joseph never called the hill near his home the Hill Cumorah.\xa0 \xa0That belief — that the hill where Joseph got the plates was the same site as the final Nephite battle — sprung up long after Joseph Smith passed away, as folks hypothesized where the Book of Mormon took place.\xa0 It didn’t help that well-meaning Church leaders latched onto the idea. The final Nephite and Jaredite battles likely happened in Mesoamerica — near where the entire narrative occurred.\xa0 Moroni wandered northward for decades.\xa0 36 years total.\xa0 A trek from Mesoamerica to NY can be accomplished by a fit person in around a year. 2) Nephi mentioned the fine steel of his bow and the Sword of Laban.\xa0 Both of these could have been made with technology of the time.\xa0 The Book of Mormon text doesn’t otherwise mention steel swords. Dr. Wade Miller discusses iron, steel, swords, the Bible, and the Book of Mormon. 3) The Book of Mormon mentions chariots, but doesn’t indicate horses led those chariots.\xa0 These “chariots” could have just have easily been smaller animals or people pulling a litter on which rested a leader. Lots on horses and the Book of Mormon here. 4) No archaeologists have excavated the Hill Cumorah.\xa0 Farmers have plowed the field, but no organized excavations have been undertaken. I’d be suprised if anything were found, but the point still remains that nobody has done the research to rule out presence of metal Nephite objects. So, when aspecific example is given by critics — and not simply exaggerated generalizations — the Book of Mormon typically stands on reliable evidence.\xa0 Sure, questions still exist, but critics’ sweeping claims are nearly always uninformed and imprecise. The same thing applies with claims toward the Lehites and DNA.\xa0 When one looks at all the evidence — and not simply listens to critics’ absolute\xa0 and usually unsupported statements — the picture becomes clearer. Watch Ugo Perego and Michael Whiting dispel common misconceptions.\xa0 These two scientists are leaders in the field of genetics, and see no conflict between their science and the Book of Mormon narrative. Another scientist, Dr. Keith A. Crandall, converted to the LDS Church.\xa0 He discusses DNA and the Book of Mormon below: A larger point should be emphasized:\xa0 how does one prove the Book of Mormon?\xa0 How does one disprove the Book of Mormon?\xa0 I’ll argue one can do neither. To say there’s not a shred of evidence for the Book of Mormon historicity is a mischaracterization.\xa0 \xa0Haven’t we — that is, LDS and non-LDS scholars — found things in Mesoamerica and elsewhere that are in sync with the narrative of the Book of Mormon?\xa0 Yep! Critics used to say say steel wasn’t known till 100s of years after Lehi.\xa0 And they mocked Joseph and the Book of Mormon for that.\xa0 That’s clearly no longer believed.\xa0 We could list item after Book of Mormon item (silk, swine, iron, etc) that is no longer a mismatch or an anachromism. Surely, not everything matches and much work remains.\xa0 But to say there’s no evidence is untrue. To prove or disprove is not possible.\xa0 To find supporting evidence is possible and is under way.\xa0 A complete fraud wouldn’t be expected to get so many matches. LDS scientists are the ones (no surprise!) who are interested in finding support for the Book of Mormon.\xa0 Other scientists typically don’t care or are perhaps mildly opposed to such ventures and findings.\xa0 Again, no surprise. Do atheist, Catholic, evangelical, or other scholars, who find wheat (or other disputed item in the Book of Mormon) in Guatemala, refuse to admit wheat was in the area?\xa0 No. They’re scholars doing scholarly work. They publish their findings, regardless of implication. Does finding wheat in Mexico change non-Mormon opinion of the LDS Church? The Book of Mormon?\xa0 Probably not in the least. Does wheat in Guatemala (if found) absolutely prove the Book of Mormon?\xa0 No.\xa0 Evidence for?\xa0 Absolutely. So, let’s allow scientists — Mormon and non-Mormon — to do their jobs:\xa0 Science.\xa0 And publish all findings. The truth will take care of itself. I expect more and more evidence will be uncovered to support the Book of Mormon. Science doesn’t answer big questions. The why questions. However, Science does demonstrate very long odds that all this “just happened by chance.” Life on this planet in a rare event.\xa0 That the universe to exist at all is amazing.\xa0 The four forces.\xa0 These issues of fine tuning of all variables in our universe — varying any one of which would throw life and the Universe out of existence — provides credibility that God exists in and created the Universe. 1.\xa0 The natural world is all there is. This claim is consistent logically equivalent to atheism.\xa0 One can’t logically prove atheism or that the natural world is all there is.\xa0 How could one prove that there is nothing beyond the natural world, when all they can study is the natural world (and nothing more)? The only way the naturalists could hold this claim #1 is by faith.\xa0 But then the naturalists would contradict claim #2.\xa0 \xa0Indeed, claim #1 is internally incoherent. 2.\xa0 We should only believe what can be scientifically proven. This second point is far too narrow.\xa0 In fact, we accept many intuitive truths that can’t be proven. 1) Ethics:\xa0 can’t prove good and evil.\xa0 2) Esthetics: can’t prove beauty.\xa0 3) Metaphysics: the reality of the past.\xa0 4) Science itself has unproveable assumptions: Special Theory of Relativity, one-way velocity of light is assumed to be constant. 5) Mathematics and logic truths:\xa0 Science presupposes logic and math. Even statement #2 itself can’t be proven scientifically.\xa0 Statement #2 is an opinion or statement of philosophy.\xa0 #2 is self-refuting and cannot be true. Great points in 1.5 minutes: Less than 2.5 minutes: John Lennox (see video below) has debated the biggest names among today’s atheists. Christians should have an evidence base for belief in Christ.\xa0 John told us of Jesus’ actions so that we might believe. 31\xa0But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. 1) Belief in Christianity is based in evidence — not blind faith.\xa0 Review John 20: 30-31 again. 2) Atheists claim to not have faith, but Lennox has challenged many atheists this way: “I’m sorry, but I thought you believed your atheism.” 3) Dawkins believes in or has faith in stuff, including his wife.\xa0 Evidence-based faith is still faith. 4) Traditional Christians don’t believe God was created (Mormons theology involves progression).\xa0 Dawkins constantly teases, “Who created your Creator?”\xa0 Lennox says nobody. Dawkins believes the Universe created him.\xa0 So, Lennox asked Dawkins, “Who created your (Dawkins’) creator?”\xa0 Still waiting for an answer. 1) We don’t believe in the God of the Gaps. 3) The Law of Gravity describes gravity, but descriptive laws do not create anything.\xa0 Ever.\xa0 We don’t even know what what gravity is.\xa0 However, Steven Hawking and other secular scientists would have you believe laws daily create matter and the entire Universe.\xa0 Not true. 4)\xa0 God created the world good.\xa0 God could have created a perfect world, but none of us would have been in it.\xa0 A world without hate will have no love.\xa0 Robotic worlds lack sin and many other problems, but they have no humans.\xa0 Bringing humans into the world is a risky business.\xa0 God’s children can grow up and say no.\xa0 Just like our kids. Another discussion with John Lennox on faith and reason.\xa0 Faith\xa0of believers.\xa0 Faith of atheists.\xa0 What is the evidence?\xa0 What of blind faith? Bill Whittle and Andrew Klavan (Christian, former Jew) discuss the limits of Science and atheism. At the 5:10 mark in the video below, Bill says when someone says “I believe in Science” you immediately know they don’t know what they’re talking about.\xa0 Science is a tool.\xa0 Like a hammer.\xa0 So, when they exclaim, “I believe in Science,” they’re really saying, “I believe in a hammer.” Science is not a philosophy.\xa0 It’s not a world view.\xa0 \xa0It’s a method.\xa0 It’s a series of questions, processes, and procedures to isolate variables and extract something out of nature. Scientism or Trans-science:\xa0 popularized by the new atheists, such as Harris, Hitchens, Dawkins, and Dennett.\xa0 An arrogant belief in objectivism — won’t believe anything other than Science — that itself becomes a religion. We can’t understand infinity or eternity.\xa0 We simply lack the neurons. Worth 12 minutes of your time. Scientism is not Science.\xa0 It’s a theory.\xa0 It’s a philosophy. The statement itself — one should only believe in what can be scientifically proven — is self-refuting.\xa0 One can’t prove one should believe this.\xa0 It’s a philosophy statement or belief — not something that itself can be proven. 1) Ethics:\xa0 can’t prove good and evil.\xa0 2) Esthetics: can’t prove beauty.\xa0 3) Metaphysics: the reality of the past.\xa0 4) Science itself has unprovable assumptions: Special Theory of Relativity, one-way velocity of light is assumed to be constant. 5) Mathematics and logic truths:\xa0 Science presupposes logic and math. Fun interchange.\xa0 William Lane Craig (on the left) is a skilled debater.\xa0 Too bad he’s not LDS. Another gem by WLC on God.\xa0 Now, I don’t agree with all of Craig’s arguments, but the discussion is wonderful.', '']","Stellar parallax is so small (as to be unobservable until the 19th century) that its apparent absence was used as a scientific argument against heliocentrism during the early modern age. It is clear from Euclid's geometry that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of Tycho Brahe's principal objections to Copernican heliocentrism that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of Saturn and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars)."

The Greeks were first unified under Philip of Macedon in the fourth century BC. His son Alexander the Great rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by Rome in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The first century AD saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in 1830 following a war of independence. Greece's rich historical legacy is reflected in large part by its 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most in Europe and the world. Greece is a democratic and developed country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life and a very high standard of living. A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), WTO, OSCE, and the OIF.

who played sirius black in harry potter movies,"['', '', ""All successful individuals have gone through various ups and downs in their lives. Persistence, perseverance, optimism and constant hard work have taken the path towards success for the world to acknowledge their mettle. Hollywood actor Gary Oldman is one such name. Gary Oldman has won a number of prestigious awards in his long acting career. An Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, along with nominations for an Emmy Award and the Palme d'Or. In 2011, Empire readers voted him the recipient of the Empire Icon Award. Gary Oldman underwent a huge metamorphosis to don the character of Winston Churchill in the political drama ‘Darkest Hour’. His claim to fame performance fetched him the Lead Actor Oscar Award at the Academy Awards 2018. Gary Oldman had earlier been nominated for the Academy Awards for his role as the British Spy George Smiley in ‘Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy’, which was released in 2011. He was also nominated for the BAFTA Awards. Gary Leonard Oldman was born in New Cross, London on the 21st of March 1958. Gary’s father Leonard Bertram Oldman was a former sailor and used to work as a welder. His mother Kathleen Cheriton Oldman was left alone with 7-year-old Gary when the alcoholic Leonard left them. It was a difficult childhood for the young Gary. Gary went to West Greenwich School in Deptford. Academic did not interest him, so he left school at the age of 16. He started to work in a Sports’ Shop to earn his livelihood and support his acting course. During his growing up years, he learned piano and used to sing. During the mid-70s, Gary used to work at various places. He used to work on assembly lines, in an operating theatre as a porter, beheading pigs in an abattoir and selling shoes. Deep down in his heart, Gary knew he wanted to become an actor. His vocation to earn his living was seen down by RADA – Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, who invited him to try the next year with a condition. The condition was that Gary should find something substantial and respectful to earn his living. Gary Oldman stands tall without going to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. It was certainly RADA’s loss. He did not lose heart over RADA’s decision. Instead, he worked hard. Gary went to win a scholarship and got the seat in the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, Southeast of London. In 1979, Gary Oldman graduated with a B. A. degree in Acting. The actor was born! Gary Oldman’s inspiration was none other than renowned actor Malcolm McDowell. In 1971, he saw ‘The Raging Moon’ and was mesmerized by his powerful aura and acting performance. Inspired, Gary decided he wanted to become an actor and gave up his aspirations to become a musician. The British actor also happens to be a filmmaker. He has worked in theatre, television and films with great success. His versatility and acting style have made him achieve a name as one among the greatest screen actors of his generation. At the age of 21, the young man started his acting career on the stage. His powerful performance gained immense success during his theatre career. He was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and has performed at the London’s Royal Court. His performance in ‘The Massacre at Paris’ in 1980, ‘Entertaining Mr. Sloane’ and ‘Saved’ in 1983, ‘The Country Wife’ in 1987 and ‘Hamlet’ in 1987 were highly acclaimed. During the early 90s, Gary was seen in various offshore characters. In the ‘State of Grace’ in 1990, he played a Hell's Kitchen gangster, portrayed the role of Lee Harvey Oswald in ‘JFK’ in 1991 and in 1992, he played the lead character of Count Dracula in ‘Bram Stoker's Dracula’. His versatility has taken him towards challenging paths as an actor. Gary Oldman has never let down his directors to portray or play a challenging character. He has outshined his directors’ expectation and faith in him as an actor. His character of the antagonists in films like ‘True Romance’ in 1993, ‘The Fifth Element’ and ‘Air Force One’ in 1997 and ‘The Contender’ in 2000 triggered his meteoric rise as the corrival. In 1994, he played the character of the corrupt DEA agent Norman Stansfield in ‘Léon: The Professional’. He received immense compliments for the role. Gary Oldman was ranked one among Cinema’s Greatest Villains’ list. Such was the magnitude of his histrionics. In ‘Immortal Beloved’ in 1994, Gary gave an acclaimed reading of Ludwig van Beethoven. Who can forget Sirius Black of the ‘Harry Potter Series’, James Gordon of ‘The Dark Knight Trilogy’, Lord Shen in ‘Kung Fu Panda – II’ or George Smiley in ‘Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy’ or else Dreyfuss – the human leader of ‘The Planet of the Apes’? Gary Oldman has stood tall in every character he has portrayed in all these films. All of Gary Oldman’s films have crossed the $10.9 billion mark worldwide. For ‘Darkest Hour’, the lead role of Winston Churchill was one of the most challenging characters he had portrayed so far in his career. His transformation was sincere hard work and a great work of the art of make-up. However, to master the body language of Winston Churchill and replicate his nuances to such perfection, Gary has not only put his best but also proved his mettle as a class actor of modern times. Success does not come easy or else on the platter. His performance won him the Oscar Award for ‘Darkest Hour’ in 2018. The sweet success was an icing on Gary’s cake! Gary Oldman has featured in various television series. Prominent among them are ‘Fallen Angels’, ‘Tracey Takes On’ and ‘Friends’. He has also appeared in music videos of Guns N’ Roses, Annie Lennox and David Bowie. The writer in him saw Gary putting in the writer-director’s hat for ‘Nil by Mouth’ in 1997. In ‘Darkest Hour’, Gary Oldman’s power-packed performance of Winston Churchill has fetched him a number of nominations and prestigious awards in 2017 – 2018. Gary won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The award-winning film based on his own childhood ‘Nil by Mouth’ was written, produced and directed by Gary Oldman in 1997. The movie won the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, which was shared with Douglas Urbanski, BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay, the Channel 4 Director's Award, and an Empire Award. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts adjudged ‘Nil by Mouth’ as one of the “100 Best British Films” of the 20th Century in 1999. In spite of his amazing success, Gary Oldman’s failure in the sanctity of marriage has taken the actor to the altar five times so far. In 1987, Gary married the British actress Lesley Manville. In 1989, the couple was blessed with their son Alfie. However, the marriage did not work. Three months after Alfie was born, Gary left Lesley. A year later, Uma Thurman and Gary met on the sets of ‘State of Grace’. Before anyone knew, they were married. Two years later, the couple got separated in 1992. With number three wife Donya Fiorentino, Gary had two sons. They got married in 1997 and were divorced by 2001. On the last day of 2008, Gary married British singer and actress Alexandra Edenborough on the 31st December. After six years of togetherness, Alexandra filed for divorce on the 9th of January 2015. Two years later, Gary married writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt in 2017. Gary Oldman is a granddad of two grandchildren – Matilda and Ozzy Oldman. They are son Alfie’s daughters."", 'Gary Leonard Oldman (born 21 March 1958) is an English screen and stage actor, filmmaker and musician known for his ""big"" portrayals of often villainous characters.

If you believe the media hype, it\'s been 33 years since Arnold Schwarzenegger last visited down under Australia and now he\'s back. The Hollywood icon has been a guest for motivational speaker Jamie McIntyre\'s 21st Century Financial Education Summits, and tonight an audience of about 500 enjoyed Arnie\'s talk at Sydney\'s Hordern Pavilion. Schwarzenegger talked to the audience about his experiences involving bodybuilding, investing, acting and politics. ""Arnold embodies everything that the Financial Education Summit is all about,"" CEO of 21st Century Education, Jamie McIntyre said. ""He is motivated, inspirational, an achiever against all odds."" Schwarzenegger has not only made his mark as a renowned action hero and body builder- he has also served as the 38th Governor of California putting the state at the forefront of the nation in addressing the issue of climate change and taking action by signing the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, as well as establishing the Million Solar Roofs Plan. For the record, Schwarzenegger\'s talk was interesting, educational, entertaining, and did pass the credibility and substance test. Make no mistake - Schwarzenegger success in business and life is no mistake.  He had a vision, a plan, learned, and put in the hard work. Special thank you to everyone involved in the success of the 21st Century Financial Education Summit, and a big thank you to the team at Markson Sparks! for helping make our coverage possible. Bio... With a career spanning 46 years and reaching the higher echelons in sport, film and politics, Governor Schwarzenegger was the youngest person ever to win the Mr. Universe title before becoming the worlds most recognisable all American action hero in films that include; Last Action Hero, True Lies, End Of Days and the hugely popular Terminator trilogy. His movies have grossed over $3 billion. Governor Schwarzenegger’s most notable accomplishments in his first six years in office included the national-leading Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 – a bipartisan agreement to combat global warming by reducing California’s greenhouse gas emissions – and overhauling the state’s workers’ compensation system – cutting costs by more than 35 percent. As Governor, Schwarzenegger has been California’s most effective marketing tool, travelling across the country and around the world promoting Californian-grown products, cutting edge technologies and the state’s diverse travel destinations. During his two terms in office, Governor Schwarzenegger worked to reform California’s fiscal policies, create a better business environment, reduce burdens on employment, boost exports and stimulate job growth. About Jamie McIntyre... It was almost 20 years ago that Jamie found himself in an unenviable position. He was completely broke, in debt to the tune of $150,000, had no job prospects and was sleeping on a friend’s couch. Jamie grew up on a farm in rural New South Wales, Australia and from an early age had dreams of being successful, however he soon discovered that no part of his education had actually taught him the skills he needed to succeed. Jamie realised the world needed a 21st Century Modern day education rather than the current out-dated education system created in the industrialisation era of the 19th Century; A “21st Century” education that was better than school or university and taught by those with a PhD in Results, not just theory. An Education – For Life! Only 5 years from being almost bankrupt, he had succeeded – Jamie had become a self-made millionaire. This incredible turnaround can be credited to Jamie’s extensive research and to the knowledge he gained from his somewhat unconventional approach of modeling multi-millionaires, entrepreneurs, investors and success coaches. www.schwarzenegger.com www.21stcenturyfinancialeducationsummit.com www.marksonsparks.com.au www.evarinaldi.com www.mediamanint.com']","Oldman went on to star as the antagonists of films such as True Romance (1993), The Fifth Element (1997), Air Force One (1997) and The Contender (2000); corrupt DEA agent Norman Stansfield, whom Oldman portrayed in Léon: The Professional (1994), has been ranked as one of cinema's greatest villains.

what is kate bush this woman's work lyrics about,"['Lyrics mean so much to my personal life. This blog is about music that relates to my opinions, love & life. Here’s a cute song about.. well, Love. =P This track simplifies how I feel sometimes. I’m quite a pessimistic person, I have a feeling like there’s always better person, better situation, better life, better experience, better anything. It’s like you try and try, and you give and give and you’ve given up. Yet, sometimes all we need is to be in the comfort of someone who can lift your spirits up. Make you feel worth living, makes you want to live in the now and look forward to the future – and forget the past (the negative ones). We won’t need a time machine if we are content, happy with our present and know that there’s always a better future awaiting in front of us all. I’ve just stumbled into this track while listening to some XFactor Contestants. What a great song. I love the tenderness and the lyrics. Totally reminded me of Kevin Michael. The high pitch tender voice and the big afro. Oh what memories. So this track is supposedly about being a mother to an unborn child and from a guy’s point of view. I got this track literally from Twitter. ViLLE BABY actually dropped me a message (and I’m sure others too) with a link to this and I’ve gotta say, I’m resonating with this track. It’s smooth, great lyrics and clear message delivered. I remember back when I listened to these tracks a lot. It’s been hard to write up these messages because we’re too busy living our lives. We’re better than that, and the problem is – others ain’t the same. How about we do our part to have some changes? Posted in Lyrics, Music Video, Personal Post, Song Comment tagged Mr. Probz, Sapphire, waves at 11:57 am by LynxLee I heard Waves on an Internet radio just a while ago and I can’t stop listening to it. Then I checked out YouTube and Mr. Probz got this video as well. I have to say, this guy has got amazing talent in music. I love it. Can you feel it? Gotta love the care in this track. We sometimes get into that state of mind when we get in love, and everything is beautiful. Then it started to get really.. addictive, really crazy in some way. Jealousy plagues in your mind, Missing that person to the state of dilemma and Unable to think straight. Who says falling in love is easy? It hurts, but probably the easiest way to feel better is to never fall in love again. I believe this is what some of my friends had decided. The excuse was, no one is perfect enough for me. Personally, if you are lovesick – move on. You’ll go through it again eventually. I heard this on the radio and thought I’d share it.', 'Kate Bush Encyclopedia is free to use, but not to operate.

A year later, the song was included in Kate\'s sixth studio album The Sensual World. The lyric is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth. Written for the movie She\'s Having a Baby, director John Hughes used the song during the film\'s dramatic climax, when Jake (Kevin Bacon) learns that the lives of his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and their unborn child are in danger. As the song plays, we see a montage sequence of flashbacks showing the couple in happier times, intercut with shots of him waiting for news of Elizabeth and their baby\'s condition. Bush wrote the song specifically for the sequence, writing from a man\'s (Jake\'s) viewpoint and matching the words to the visuals which had already been filmed. The song was used in the 21st episode of the third season of Party Of Five, the second episode of the series Alias and in the first episode of the second season of The Handmaid\'s Tale. The song was also used in the film A Man Called Otto. \'This Woman\'s Work\' was released as a 7"" single, a 7"" picture disc single, a 12"" single (with poster sleeve), a cassette single and a CD-single. In Germany, a 3"" CD-single was also released. On all formats, the bonus track Be Kind To My Mistakes was included, plus - on all formats except the 7"" singles and the cassette single - I\'m Still Waiting. There are four different versions of \'This Woman\'s Work\'. The original version was released on the soundtrack album of the movie \'She\'s Having A Baby\'. The version of the song that was featured on \'The Sensual World\' was re-edited from the original version. The version released as a single was a third, slightly different mix.Finally, \'This Woman\'s Work\' was completely re-recorded on Kate\'s 2011 album Director\'s Cut. The new version features a sparse performance of Bush playing the piano and singing. The music video was directed by Bush herself. It starts with Bush, spotlighted in an otherwise black room, playing the introductory notes on a piano. In the next scene, a distraught man (played by Tim McInnerny) is pacing in the waiting room of a hospital. It is then revealed through flashbacks that his wife (played by Bush) has collapsed while they were having dinner. The story blurs into a continuous scene where he carries her to the car, a desperate race to the hospital, and his wife being wheeled away on a stretcher as he races in behind her. While waiting, the husband is wracked with fear and imagines his wife in happier times, kissing him in the rain, and even imagines the nurse coming to tell him she has died. The nurse then pulls him out of his reverie, as she reassuringly puts her hand on his shoulder and tells him about his wife\'s situation, the outcome of this is left ambiguous; yet the nurse is seen smiling as she speaks, implying a happy outcome. The final scene of the video returns to Bush as silently closes the piano keyboard. \'This Woman\'s Work\' was covered by Aco, Baby Bushka, Beloved, Bonnie Bailey, Dark Dark Dark, Kat Devlin, E-Clypse featuring Emma Price, Jess Gillam, Goodknight Productions, Göteborgs Symfoniker, Glennis Grace, Hope for Isla & Jude,\xa0 The Kate Bush Experience, Lady Maisery, Greg Laswell, Maxwell, Hope Murphy, Octover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Quaker Notes, Lindsay Schief, Titlucio, Tk The Prophet,\xa0 TM Collective, Reginald Van Carreker and Rachel Z. John Hughes, the American film director, had just made this film called \'She\'s Having A Baby\', and he had a scene in the film that he wanted a song to go with. And the film\'s very light: it\'s a lovely comedy. His films are very human, and it\'s just about this young guy - falls in love with a girl, marries her. He\'s still very much a kid. She gets pregnant, and it\'s all still very light and child-like until she\'s just about to have the baby and the nurse comes up to him and says it\'s a in a breech position and they don\'t know what the situation will be. So, while she\'s in the operating room, he has so sit and wait in the waiting room and it\'s a very powerful piece of film where he\'s just sitting, thinking; and this is actually the moment in the film where he has to grow up. He has no choice. There he is, he\'s not a kid any more; you can see he\'s in a very grown-up situation. And he starts, in his head, going back to the times they were together. There are clips of film of them laughing together and doing up their flat and all this kind of thing. And it was such a powerful visual: it\'s one of the quickest songs I\'ve ever written. It was so easy to write. We had the piece of footage on video, so we plugged it up so that I could actually watch the monitor while I was sitting at the piano and I just wrote the song to these visuals. It was almost a matter of telling the story, and it was a lovely thing to do: I really enjoyed doing it. (Roger Scott Interview, BBC Radio 1 (UK), 14 October 1989) That\'s the sequence I had to write the song about, and it\'s really very moving, him in the waiting room, having flashbacks of his wife and him going for walks, decorating... It\'s exploring his sadness and guilt: suddenly it\'s the point where he has to grow up. He\'d been such a wally up to this point. (Len Brown, \'In The Realm Of The Senses\'. NME (UK), 7 October 1989) There\'s a film called \'She\'s Having A Baby\'. And John Hughes, the director, rung up and said that he had a sequence in the film that he really wanted a song written to be with. And I\'d only worked the once before on the \'Castaway\' film - where I\'d really enjoyed that - so I was extremely tempted by the offer. And when he sent the piece of film that the song was going to be part of, I just thought it was wonderful, it was so moving, a very moving piece of film. And in a way, there was a sense that the whole film built up to this moment. And it was a very easy song to write. It was very quick. And just kind of came, like a lot of songs do. Even if you struggle for months, in the end, they just kind of go - BLAH! - You know. [Laughs]. So that was the first song that I wrote for \'The Sensual World\' album. In fact at the time we weren\'t even sure whether to put it on the album or not. And I must say that Del was very instrumental in saying that I should put it on the album, and I\'m very glad I did. Because I had the most fantastic response - in some ways, maybe the greatest response - to this song. And I was really - I was absolutely thrilled, that you felt that way about it. (Kate Bush Con, 1990) (I know you have a little life in you yetI know you have a lot of strength left.I know you have a little life in you yet.I know you have a lot of strength left.)']","The lyric of ""This Woman's Work"" is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth.

Vitamin C is water-soluble and is an enantiomer of ascorbic acid. (Commercial vitamin C is often a mixture of ascorbic acid and other ascorbates.) Ascorbic acid, C6H8O6, is a reducing agent that reacts rapidly with iodine (I2). As the iodine is added during the titration, the ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid, while the iodine is reduced to iodide ions as shown in the following equation. Due to this reaction, the iodine formed is immediately reduced to iodide as long as there is any ascorbic acid present. The amount of ascorbic acid is determined by the stoichiometry of the equations and the difference between the total amount of iodine present and the amount that reacts with the thiosulphate. This method is suitable for use with vitamin C tablets, fresh or packaged fruit juices and solid fruits and vegetables. “ Ok, let me say I’m extremely satisfy with the result while it was a last minute thing. I really enjoy the effort put in. ” Vitamins are a group of small molecular compounds that are essential nutrients in many multi-cellular organisms, and humans in particular. L-Ascorbic acid was first isolated as a pure substance by Albert Azent-Gyorgi and Charles Kingin 1928 (Pauling, 1970), an anti-oxidant and free radical scavenger, is found ubiquitously in fruit and vegetables such as citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes, tangerines etc.), melons, tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, green leafy vegetables such as spinach, potatoes and turnips, its quantitative determination is especially important in the production of wine, beer, milk, soft drinks and fruit juices, where it can be a quality indicator (Gerrior & Zizza, 1994)] .

Vitamin C\xa0is essential for the healing of wounds, and for the repair and maintenance of cartilage, bones and teeth (Mcevoy, 1993) one of the several ways of determining the ascorbic acid content of a solution is by titration. Titration is a volumetric analysis and is one of the basic analytical techniques in chemistry which enables one to quantitatively determine how much of a specific substance is contained in a given sample. This technique is involved in almost every aspects of our daily living such as life sciences, clinical chemistry, water pollution, industrial analyses etc. In order to make meaningful titration analysis, one has to understand and learn the principles involved. Several types of titration techniques are now available but, two general types which are still in much use are acid-base and reduction-oxidation (Redox). Acid-base titration involves the neutralization reaction and the products are generally salt and water. Redox titrations involve the titration of an oxidizing agent (or oxidant) with a reducing agent (or reductant) or vice versa. Oxidation process involves loss of electrons while reduction process involves gain of electrons. Thus an oxidizing agent is one which accepts electrons while a reducing agent is one which loses the electrons. There must be a sufficiently large difference between the oxidizing and reducing capabilities of these agents for the reaction to undergo completion with a sharp end point. A. STANDARDIZATION OF SODIUM THIOSULPHATE 1. A standard titration setup was framed up using a stand, a burette clamp and a white tile B. ANALYSIS OF VITAMIN C TABLETS 1. A tablet of vitamin c was transferred into a 250ml conical flask and\xa0approximately 40cm3 of 2M H2SO4 was added. The tablet was then crushed to dissolve until a solution formed. 2. Using a measuring cylinder, 10cm3 of 10% KI solution was added to the tablet solution and 25cm3 of standard KIO3 solution was pipetted in to the flask. 3. The solution was then immediately titrated with standard thiosulphate solution in the burette until the dark color changed to the original color of the tablet. 4. This procedure was repeated with 2 more samples of the tablet. 5. The volume of sodium thiosulphate used in each titration was recorded and the average volume was calculated. Table results from standardization of sodium thiosulphate (A) Number of moles of KBrO3 in 25cm3 solution = [this formula is used because the molarity of the solution is given and the volume is known]\xa00.00964×0.025=0.000241mol Mass of KBrO3 solution used= [this formula is used in deriving the mass of a substance when the no. of moles is given (or derived)]=0.000241mol×167g/mol=0.040247g= 40.25mg No. of moles of Na2S2O3 required for one titration = 0.00241mol×6= 0.01446mol Moles of I2 liberated = 2.41×10-4 moles Concentration of Na2S2O3= 0.298mol/dm3 Number of moles of KIO3 in 25cm3 solution = 0.00100 mol Moles of I2 produced by 25cm3 of KIO3= 0.00100×3= 0.003 moles No. of mole of Na2S2O3 = No. of mole of original I2 – no. of mole of excess I2 =0.000723- 0.0005=0.000223mol No. of mole of I2 that reacted with ascorbic acid = 0.006-0.0005 = 0.0055 Mass of ascorbic acid = 176×0.0055= 0.92g =920mg The experiment was successfully carried out and the results were encouraging. The analysis of the vitamin c content of the Cenovis tablet was carried out using titration. The vitamin c tablet was crushed into a conical flask and specific amounts of KI and KIO3 were added. The solution was then titrated with standard thiosulphate solution until the required color was derived. The results were recorded and calculations to determine the amount of ascorbic acid in each tablet was also successfully done. However the results\xa0from the experiment showed different values from the manufacturer’s specifications. The manufacturer (Cenovis) claims that each vitamin c tablet contains 1000mg of ascorbic acid while this experiment shows otherwise. After calculations were done, the experiment found each vitamin c tablet to be containing about 920mg of ascorbic acid which is below the manufacturer’s specification. However this error could be as a result of different factors; 1. The manufacturer of the tablet made wrong analysis of the tablet. 2. This experiment contained errors which arose from wrong reading of instruments, wrong calibration of instruments, or errors in uncertainty. studymode.js. (2010). commercial vitamin c tablet analysis.

Please see the OU\xa0Molecular Clusters Group pages. I am the module chair of Further Material in Medical Physics S829 and a member of the module team for Radiotherapy and its Physics S819. In addition, I am a study advisor for the NMR component of Practical Science S288. My activities on these modules include preparing tutor marked assignments, exam questions, core materials, and slide-casts. I also give on-line tutorials, answer students’ questions on forums, monitor marking and tutor feedback, examine end-of-module presentations, and am a member of the S809 (Imaging in Medicine), S819, and S829 exam boards. I have previously tutored at the Electromagnetism: Experiments, Applications, and Simulations SMXR359 andQuantum Mechanics: Experiments, Applications, and Simulations SMXR358 residential schools. I have also prepared ebooks forSport: the Science Behind the Medals S172, marked exams for The Physical World S207, and delivered post-graduate training lectures at the OU and the New University of Lisbon. Prior to joining the OU, I contributed to training prospective lycée physics teachers (CAPES) in experimental demonstration at the University of Lyon 1 (2004) and worked as a postgraduate teaching assistant at University College London (2002-03). Nanoparticle-based radio-sensitization is thought to produce a radiation-induced release of electrons from gold electronic orbitals that then react with the surrounding water and dissolved oxygen to produce reactive species (particularly oxygen species) that damage nearby proteins, DNA, RNA, and cell organelles. In addition, the electrons are expected to damage DNA and RNA (and indeed other critical biological macromolecules) in a more direct manner through dissociative electron attachment (DEA). However, whereas extensive radiobiological research is currently in progress worldwide into the potential therapeutic applications of nanoparticles, the fundamental physical mechanisms underpinning nanoparticle radio-sensitization have been studied relatively sparsely. In particular, the relative contribution of DEA has not been assessed conclusively. This project brings together an international team of researchers with expertise in DEA (OU, BAM), solution-phase radiochemistry (BAM, FCT/UNL), and UV spectroscopy (OU, BAM, FCT/UNL). The aim is to probe damage processes in key DNA subunits (nucleobases, nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides) initiated by the electrons emitted from gold nanoparticles that have been excited using a pulsed laser. The damage in the biomolecules will be identified by in-situ UV spectroscopy. The technique has been pioneered by Bald and co-workers (BAM) and will be further developed in this project. Focusing on DNA subunits will enable detailed comparisons to be drawn with electron scattering experiments and calculations, maximising the opportunity to trace the observed damage to specific nanoscale physical processes. Collaborations with Dr Stefano Caprasecca (University of Pisa) and Prof Andrey Solovyov (MBN Explorer) will support the experimental programme. This H2020 Twinning project ‘Achievement of Excellence in Electron Processes for Future Technologies’ (ELEvaTE) is aimed at advancing the excellence of the Electron and Plasma Physics Laboratory (EPPL) in the Faculty of Mathematics Physics and Informatics, Comenius University in Bratislava such that it becomes a centre of international excellence and an exemplar for other Slovakian HEI while furthering the Strategy for Smart Specialization of the Slovak Republic. The goal of the ELEvaTE is to provide the EPPL opportunity to learn from partners to achieve ambition of creating a centre of excellence. ELEvaTE will twin EPPL with the Molecular Physics Group at the Open University (OU) in United Kingdom and Nano-Bio-Group at the Institute for Ion Physics and Applied Physics at the University of Innsbruck (UI). The OU is exceptional in results dissemination and the UI combines research with enterprise (e.g. ‘spin out’ company Ionicon, world's leading producer of PTRMS), both are exemplars of ‘widening participation and gender sensitive research’ and are strong in preparing IPR. ©.. .""]","Absorption spectroscopy is employed as an analytical chemistry tool to determine the presence of a particular substance in a sample and, in many cases, to quantify the amount of the substance present.

where did the first potato chip come from,"['Today I found out about the history of French fries. Exactly who introduced these golden strips of goodness to the world isn’t entirely known.\xa0 Among the various theories, it’s generally accepted that the French fry was invented by either the Belgians or the French. Potatoes were first introduced to Europe not through the French or Belgians, but through the Spanish.\xa0 In 1537, Jimenez de Quesada and his Spanish forces encountered a village in Colombia where all the natives had fled.\xa0 Among other things, they found in the native’s food stuffs potatoes, which the Spanish initially called “truffles”. Around 20 years later, potatoes were brought back to Spain and also introduced to Italy.\xa0 At this time, the potatoes were still quite small and bitter and didn’t grow well in either Spain or Italy.\xa0 However, over time, larger and less bitter versions of the plant were cultivated and the plant gradually caught on elsewhere in Europe, though it was initially met with quite a bit of resistance (for more on that, see the bonus facts at the bottom). In any event, historical accounts indicate that the Belgians were possibly frying up thin strips of potatoes as early as the late 17th century (though some claim it wasn’t until the late 18th century) in the Meuse Valley between Dinant and Liège, in Belgium.\xa0 How they supposedly came up with the idea was that, in this area, it was very common for the people to fry up small fish as a staple for their meals.\xa0 However, when the rivers froze up thick enough, it tended to make it somewhat difficult to get fish.\xa0 So instead of frying up fish in these times, they would cut up potatoes in long thin slices, and fry them up as they did the fish. Giving some credence to this story is that the Spanish controlled much of what is now modern day Belgium at the time the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe.\xa0 So, at least, the Belgians probably were among the first to have a crack at the potato, in terms of thinking up ways to prepare food from potatoes. Now to the French argument: the popularity of the potato in France is largely credited to a French army medical officer named Antoine-Augustine Parmentier, who very famously championed the potato throughout France and parts of Europe. During the Seven Years War, Parmentier was taken captive and, as a part of his prison rations, was given potatoes. At this time, the French had previously used potatoes only for hog feed and never ate them.\xa0 The reason being that they thought potatoes caused various diseases.\xa0 In fact, in 1748, the French Parliament even banned cultivation of potatoes as they were convinced potatoes caused leprosy.\xa0 However, while in prison in Prussia, Parmentier was forced to cultivate and eat potatoes and found the French notions about the potato just weren’t true. When he came back to France, Parmentier began championing the potato as a potential food source.\xa0 Finally, in 1772, the Paris Faculty of Medicine proclaimed that potatoes were edible for humans, though Parmentier still encountered significant resistance and wasn’t even allowed to grow potatoes in his garden at the Invalides hospital where he worked as a pharmacist. Parmentier then began a more aggressive campaign to promote the potato in France, hosting dinners featuring potatoes with such notable dignitaries as Benjamin Franklin, Antoine Lavoisier, King Louis XVI, and Queen Marie Antoinette.\xa0 He also would hire armed guards to surround his potato patch, to try to convince people that what was in the patch was very valuable.\xa0 He would then tell the guards to accept any bribes they were offered by people and let them “steal” the potatoes.\xa0 In the end though, it took a famine in 1785 for the potato to become popular in France. Once the French accepted the potato though, its popularity skyrocketed in France. By 1795, potatoes were being grown on a very large scale in France, including at the royal gardens at Tuileries, where the gardens were converted into potato fields.\xa0 Within that span of time, the French either invented or learned to make fries.\xa0 Once discovered/invented French fries became extremely popular in France, particularly in Paris, where they were sold by push-cart vendors on the streets and called “frites”. Now, it should be noted that this all happened in the late 18th century, which was as much as 100 years after some people say the Belgians were supposedly already making “French” fries. But by other arguments, this all happened around the same time for both the French and the Belgians. So who knows? It should also be noted that, shortly before the potato became popular in France, the Franco-Austrian war was going on (also known as the War of Austrian Succession), much of which took place around modern day Belgium.\xa0 So it’s possible that the French soldiers were introduced to fries by the Belgians at this time and, a couple decades later when the potato became popular in France, these former soldiers then introduced the preparation method to the rest of France.\xa0 Or it’s possible the French came up with the idea on their own and spread them to Belgium around the same time; or that both came up with the idea independently. Whatever the case, it was the French who seem to be the ones that spread fries to America and Britain and it, in turn, was the Americans, through fast food chains, that eventually popularly introduced them to the rest of the non-European world as “French fries”.\xa0 Ironically, because of this latter spread by American fast food chains, in many parts of the non-European world, “French fries” are more often than not known as “American fries”. “The British tend to favor malt vinegar for dipping their fries.” Dipping?!?! no-one dips their chips in vinegar. The vinegar is splashed or drizzled over the chips, much like the way the salt is sprinkled. Glad you picked that up. As a bonus fact here in Australia neither plain salt nor vinegar is favoured. Instead it is chicken salt that is the preferred condiment. jimenez de Quesada visited COLombia in 1537, not Columbia. I’m Colombian and it somewhat bothers me when people mistake the two, although the real reason this should be fixed that this site is aimed at informing people not with inaccuracies but with factual information. @Ivan: That’s good information.  I don’t mind grammar Nazis, in general.  I only mind troll grammar Nazis.  Your comment was not in any way trolling though.  It was just good information. You need to correct your information about the origin of the word potatoes because the original word of potatoes is Arabic and the Arabs introduced it to Spain when Arab Muslims occupied Spain.potatoes in Arabic is Patata and thats how the word came about. @khaled: Sources?  I’d be surprised if that were true because the potato came from Peru where they were cultivated as far back as 3000 BC.  Further, when the Muslims first occupied Spain around the 7th century, South America was obviously unknown.  It wasn’t until much later that Spanish sailors brought the potato back to Europe from South America.   And, of course, every reputable source I’ve found thus far says the etymology of the word is as stated above. Man they are way off on this one. I invented the potato in 1954 from the tiny wild potatos growing at my great aunts house in Croswell Mi. I proliferated the size to usable then in 1956 I invented the deep fryer and lard deep frying at Chicken in the rough resteraunt Pine Grove avenue Port Huron Mi. Shoestrings they were first called. Then after I invented all the varieties we have today over the years. Belgium did not exist until 1830. The reference to the French fry having its beginning in the area between Dinant and Liege should indicate that it was not in Belgium, but in the Netherlands, Southern Netherlands as the area was referred to from the Treaty of Vienna in 1815 until 1830. @Richard, II reply to your comment (http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/09/the-history-of-french-fries/)  Yes that’s true  but people refer to “french fries”, not fries in general. Like a Belgian story says where the name “French” comes from that was added to “fries”. I’m Belgian by the way and I haven’t seen any proof of that story to be true.  So people think of Belgium’s French fries because of that story I might think.  The truth about fries is that it originated in France (noted I said only “fries”) in 1760; this is the earliest origin of that word in a monastery in Bourgogne.  Thus we know because recipes do still exist from that time frame that fries weren’t cut in slices, in thin tranches, but were round. Squashed potatoes, dipped in flower (with or without herbs) and cooked in grease. This is literally mentioned in recipes from that time. To make a story short, we know it was prepared this way and was called “fries”, when it was cut in slices NO indication or proof exist to this day. Thus we do not know WHEN someone came up with the idea to cut it in slices. We do know where it originated from and that’s Paris, France. @Vincent, I reply to your comment of 2013 YES!

It’s “Shepherd’s Pie”, as in eaten by shepherds, not Sheppards. Also, Ferdinand and Isabella sponsored Columbus’ voyage in 1492 precisely *because* the Moors had been expelled from the Iberian Peninsula and all of Spain was under Christian control. “Exactly who introduced these golden strips of goodness to the world isn’t entirely know.” @Davide: Thanks for the catch.  Fixed! 🙂 It is known that I created the potato and fries but not to a large number of people. The hogwash about the ancients eating them is pure hogwash. Until I began proliferating our food suplies and varieties in 1954 man survived on strictley bread and water and it was break your teeth rock hark unleven and people were too stupid to invent the drinking glass they just sucked water from the ditch like all the other animals I invented carnival glass in 1954 and pitcher sets  man what an improvement Your first and fourth pictures show potato CHIPS, which have a nice crusty exterior and a somewhat edible interior. If the potato is cut perpendicular to the long axis into thin (about 1mm thick) discs, dumping these into boiling oil will produce CRISPS which are, well, crisp all the way through; they get put into airfilled packets (to prevent squashing) and consumed cold – and noisily – in large quantities at movies, barbeques, sports events etc. Chips on the other hand are much more likely to be served hot on a plate alongside steaks, vegetables, burgers etc. Crisps are therefore likely to be deepfried almost by definition, while chips can be fried in a variety of ways. Unfortunately for you, everything you said is only true in one location, Great Britain.  In the US and Canada, and most other areas of the world, what you describe as “Crisps” are Potato CHIPS (and since they were originally created in upstate New York, Saratoga in fact, and called Potato Chips by the chef who originated them, you are, frankly, wrong). As mentioned in the article, in SOME parts of the world, some countries call what you are referring to as “Chips”, but in most other countries, they are called Thick Cut Fries, Steak Fries, or Wedges (or use a localized version of one of those names).  Most of the world would use the American terms, since they’ve predominantly been introduced under their American labels to the local populations by American companies or military members. Fish and chips was my original concept and Sarnia Ontario was where I invented putting the vinager on the chips the year was 1970 or about. Aurthur Treacher fish and chips spun off the original resteraunt 1.  TIFO is wonderfully informative.  Thank you for your efforts. 2.  In the second to last Bonus Fact here, you’ll want to change “manor” to “manner”, as it is correctly spelled in the first bonus Jefferson reference.  Stupid autocorrect… @Jack: Thanks for catching that, and I’m glad you like the site. 🙂 Excellent article.  Some times it helps when we view the history of foods from a less Euro-centric perspective. I addition it is important not to focus on how certain food were introduced to the US as an expansion from the original 13 founder states. But how they were introduced in general (Southwest, Fl, LA, etc.) By analogy the Portuguese introduced frying to Japan (Catholics ate a lot of fried fish during during lent: Tempora).  Thus derives modern Japanese Tempura. Most likely fried potatoes were made and consumed in South America long before potatoes were introduced and later popularized in Europe. Think about it why wait two hundred years to fry readily available potatoes when you are already frying fish and other foods? I hope my comments lead to more thoughts on this. Happy eating Papas con Aji! @Gustavo,  Just additional information on your comment in 2014 YES!

In the United States those are all types of |”fries”hose are ‘chips’ in Britain  but they are “fries” here in the states.  In the my part of the U.S. anyway (upper Midwest) the first are ‘French fries,’ the second ‘curly fries,’ the third ‘steak fries’ and the last ‘seasoned fries’… but they could all safely just be called “French fries’ as they are all just various variations of French fries. I like having my fries with mayo and the waiters hate me for it since it slips their mind and they have to go back to the kitchen. For a kick in the pants at home, I will add some cayenne powder for some extra deliciousness. I used to work at McDonald’s, and we did not fry the fries twice. Drop the bucket, hit the timer. when the timer goes off, lift the bucket and drain. Shake the bucket, dump the fires in the bin and salt them. I still see that procedure, so where do you get the idea they fry them twice? @Jennifer: I believe, if memory serves, they are fried before they are frozen and sent out to the restaurants. Either that and I’m misremembering and they simply don’t do that anymore. 🙂 Aloha. Great article thanks. 🙂 Yes, you are correct. They are pre-fried, then left to cool before being fried again. A skin forms on them  and this way you get a nice crispy skin and soft center. My family had fish and chip shops in New Zealand for years. McDonald’s also does the same procedure. And any fries you buy to cook at home, oven fries, etc, are all precooked. If you cook them from scratch, they tend to burn on the outside without getting the inside soft. And you won’t get the decent skin you’ll get on a traditional chip or fry. A cold, thinly cut potato slice is a potato chip to New Zealanders, what the British call a crisp. Hi, a belgian here, we actually fry our delicious fries twice. There are specific rules concerning temperature for the first and second bakingperiod. And we mostly eat them with mayo (sometimes adding a belgian beef-and-beerstew). What is called French fries or fries in the US, is called chips in the UK. @Erwin: Of course.  Let’s ignore documented history and instead go with subjective anecdotal data. 😉 Sure Mr. Hiskey, ignore what any Belgian says right? Let’s rely on the British for everything! You’ll end up in hot water, or what you British call “beer” You do know history didn’t begin when you were born….don’t you? @Erwin Cools. I refer to your comment of 2015 at http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/09/the-history-of-french-fries/#comment-1673373  French fries didn’t originated from Belgium at all. Belgians like to believe that.  A journalist/historian Jo Gérard wrote an article about how in a manuscript from 1781 was describes how “poor” people cooked their potatoes that were sliced in fin tranches. Only no manuscript was found. He couldn’t tell us where he found that manuscript or where it originated from. It was simply not the truth.  Further, the word “fries” was first discovered in Bourgogne, France in a monastery on some document.  We do not where or who added the word “French” to “fries”. I know about the story about WWWI soldiers who ate fries as we know today, and because the army was officially French speaking, it is said that they added the word “French” to it. Only no proof or real indication has been discovered. Furthermore… it is not know at all (this means not discovered) who or when people started to slice their potatoes in thin tranches. We do know that it originated in Paris, France. Sorry to tell you this. I’m also a Belgian and love to eat it with “sauce americain”. I researched it as much as possible. A historian with an university degree from the university of Liège, wrote an article about this, Pierre Leclercq, that was based upon proof (recipes from the old days) and facts that were written down in old documents. Here’s the link but it’s all written in french because he was a Walloon, a french speaking from Belgium.  https://www.musee-gourmandise.be/fr/77-musee-gourmandise/articles-fond/132-la-veritable-histoire-de-la-frite Fries with an egg on it? It is probably delicious… but as a Belgian I never heard of it and saw it in belgium. What we put on it if we go to a “Friterie” or “Frituur” is beefstew or beefstew saus… or Vol – au – vent  or balls in tomato saus. Britain is not a country. Geographically it is the British Isles, politically it is the United Kingdom, although I do hold a British Passpost. British is a throw back to the British Empire, now the Commonwealth. The British Isles contains 4 countries, the largest being England, with Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Steve,  I am Belgian and I did eat frites topped with an egg. When I was a toddler, the Flemish husband of my nanny used to make them. He came from Oost Vlaanderen and years later, a friend’s husband was so happy I also enjoyed it – because his wife found the habit disgusting. He was also from Oost Vlaanderen. It is my madeleine de Proust The article’s author makes it seems like the Americans were the only ones who fought WWI.  The thing is, the Americans didn’t enter the war until the last year: 1917 – 1918; so it’s more than likely that “French” fries were introduced to the Canadians fighting in WWI as we were there from the start to the end: 1914 – 1918. We Americans didn’t send soldiers until 1917, but there were many hundreds of other Americans there from the start of the war; these included volunteer ambulance drivers (my uncle was one), volunteer nurses, doctors, mechanics, and legions of women volunteers who worked close to the lines, making food (including doughnuts) for the soldiers of all nations, acting as hospital personnel and even fixing the Model T ambulances. And these were simple citizens, not part of the Army! They didn’t have to be there. And, please remember that all the heroic French, British, Canadian, African, etc. forces couldn’t do diddly-squat against the Germans in 3 years of slaughter. In Sept. 1918 the Americans launched their first major offensive….and it was all over in 2 months. Europeans should spend less time fussing about French Fries and give thanks that they aren’t all speaking German. P.S. We have a house in France and love visiting. You need to get so more history lessons from Hollywood. You Americans always presume “if it wasn’t for you”. Unfortunately your history and geography is solely based on the US, anything anyone else contributed is either never learned or minimized There was good reason for thinking the tomato was poisonous, as it is closely related to deadly nightshade which produces medicinal substances (hyoscamine, scopalamine and atropine).  These are all muscuranic antagonists that are still in use today as individual medications and in combination with phenobarbital (belladonna alkyloids with phenobarbital, though I think this is more to prevent abuse because this combo isn’t controlled).  These are medications that can easily reach toxic doses at quantities of plant that could easily be ingested. Hi, I have a small question. Just a small nit to pick… And yes, yes I know this article is old but I’m compelled to write this because this site’s usually pretty factual. “So, at least, the Belgians probably were among the first to have a crack at the potato, in terms of thinking up ways to prepare food from potatoes.” Err… It’s not like there was just one “American” people. There were many, many culturally (and even ethnic, meaning genetic, variations) diverse peoples in the “New World.” Given the nature of the beast that is humanity, they even traded with one another. It’s a real stretch to say that the Belgians were probably “among the first to have a crack…” In fact, they were probably nowhere near the first to have a go at it. If you want a probability, one probably could surmise that some Amerindian, somewhere, tossed some sliced potato onto a hot stone and let it cook. They also had a variety of oily substances so they may well have fried the thing in potato long before Europeans were even aware of the continent. Those are some probabilities… 😉 They’re far more probable than the Belgians (or French) having anything at all to do with it. ‘Tis a shame, you’re usually more astute and accurate here. I get the newsletter but only started that maybe a year ago – though I’ve visited off and on for much longer. Alas, you don’t have a plugin setup so that I can elect to be notified of responses to this – I’ll include my email and use a real link for once. I expect to be accredited and a formal correction to be published, this week! *snickers* Obviously, not really. I just found it amusing that you’d overlook that. ‘Cause, you know, from the way I see things – they weren’t really among the first. As an aside, and while on the subject of South America – there’s a whole bunch of interesting things one could write about concerning vanilla. I just did a quick search and nothing popped up. Vanilla actually has a fairly interesting history. Oh, the puns I could make but I’ll spare you. @KGIII, I reply on your comment of 2016. In VERY short… The word “fries” was already used in 1760 in recipes in France. Further fries didn’t meant that it was cut in slices, in thin tranches but they were made round. They were squashed potatoes dipped in flower and than cooked in grease. We do not know when people started to cut the potato in slices but we do know that this originated in France. About the story “French” that was added by the Belgians, their is no proof or indication at all for this claim. By the way, I’m Belgian. McDonald’s fries are NOT fried twice. They are cooked exactly 3 min 20 sec and are held in the fry bin for 7 minutes. McDonald’s also does NOT coat their fries with anything, unlock BK. They are cooked in 100% pure Vegetable oil. That is filtered daily and changed  when it gets too dark. And yes I have worked there. I was a manager. They are fried and prepared perfectly before they ever reach the McDonald’s stores. What you got was a pre-prepared frozen version of the fry that simply needed fried once more to be ready for the customer’s mouths.  See Meg’s comment below. My whole family is from Belgium. When i was young I never saw any French fry carts in France but they were all over in Belgium. I think durring the war they heard the people making the french fries  speaking french. Most people in Belgium speak french so thats why they called them french fries. @Cherryh2o, apparently you do not live in Belgium. I do and am Belgian from birth. The story about the American soldiers from WWWI and the connection with the french speaking people of Belgium so that they added the word “French” to it is just a story.  There is no proof at all. No letter from a soldier who told about this, nothing.  There are more Flemish than French speaking people in  Belgium. I read that sherpherd’s pie technically must use lamb as the meat. For obvious reasons. Cottage Pie is what you reference with ground beef. Nice article! However, there is an important fact missing. The Spanish did indeed bring potato and tomato plants with them from the Americas, but due to their hesitancy to eat them(as you quite correctly write), the plants were used only for decoration. The Florentines were the first to eat them, sliced, fried, AND deep-fried, because they were also the first to deep-fry ANYTHING in Europe! One could fill a book with recipes which people think are from other countries in origin (especially France!) and which are actually Italian. “Hachis Parmentier is basically ground beef topped with mashed potatoes and cheese.  Variations on this dish include adding gravy, corn, or other vegetables.” Some recipes Hachis Parmentier are made with shredded bits of beef, often as a leftover from pot-au-feu (beef stew/pot roast) which also includes the potatoes. I don’t know if it’s a more traditional recipe for sure, but i’ve been told it is.', '', 'Pray. Live. Inspire. Eat. Dream. Daily life and instances round the corner Ask any school kid, most would know the famous tag line, “Betcha Can’t Eat Just One” of Lay’s® Potato Chip Slogan from the early 1960’s. Over the years, although the slogans have under gone a little modification with endorsers changing, the flavours still holds us captive. Early recipes similar to the potato crisps of today, was in William Kitchiner’s cookbook “The Cook’s Oracle” (1817) with “Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings”. The methodology reads to “peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping”. Yet legend attributes the first potato “chips” to George Crum, an American chef of African American and Native American heritage at Saratoga Springs, New York in 1853. Trying to appease an unhappy customer on August 24th, 1853 who had kept sending his French-fried potatoes back, complaining that they were too thick, too “soggy,” and/or not salted well enough. Frustrated, Crum personally sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried them to a crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt. To Crum’s surprise, the customer loved them and soon came to be called “Saratoga Chips”. Food history truly appreciates Crum’s customer Cornelius Vanderbilt for triggering\xa0the innovation. Since then packaging and production took over the regular potato chips to a mass commercial enterprise. In United Kingdom and Ireland, “Potato Chips” are referred to as “crisps” when eaten at room temperature, while when served hot and fried are “chips”. But in many places, largely these terminologies are interchangeable\xa0and not very specific. “Did you know that when potatoes go to the barbers, they can either have a straight cut, a crinkle cut or a slice?” Anthony T. Hincks The mass popularity of “potato chips” is evidenced by the regional varieties as well as local flavours and seasonings like dill pickle, ketchup. red paprika and so on. Additional variants like potato sticks, also known as shoestring potatoes; baked potato chips have been marketed. The “chips” craze has also been spread to corn, rice, arrowroot or cassava as well as root vegetables like carrots, parsnips and rutabagas. Though not known as chips, but crisps in some places, the snacking options are varied and plentiful. “Every potato is just a chip waiting to get out.” Anthony T. Hincks One can be quite innovative with potato crisps, besides having them direct from the packet, they can be tossed into salads or crushed to make spicy mixes for “party snacks”, as “chaats”, sandwich\xa0fillers “sweet, sour or spicy and hot” and the like.\xa0\xa0Though not advisable on a regular basis, “potato chips” are here to stay. Better late than never, what better to celebrate “National Potato Chip Day” (March 14th) by indulging in a couple of them. As they say, all good things come in small packages; keeping “potato chips” in moderation would help us in indulging these cravings for snacking once in a while, for a longer time.

Cook and explore along with me through the wonderful recipes in her classic book The Virginia House-Wife, first published in 1826. – – An Indigo House Digital project Peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peal a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping. Take care that your fat and frying-pan are quite clean; put it on a quick fire, watch it, and as soon as the lard boils and is still, put in the slices of potatoes, and keep moving them till they are crisp; take them up and lay them to drain on a sieve; send them up with very little salt sprinkled on them. I hope with this recipe to help lay aside the French Fry/Thomas Jefferson origin myth. Except for not being sliced into what we think of as the long skinny rectangle French fry shape these round sliced and fried potatoes of Mary Randolph are clearly pretty darn close. She doesn’t say what kind of potatoes so I used Yukon Gold as they were what I had in my pantry. In order not to have the hot oil spatter all over it is important that you always dry the sliced potatoes in a cloth. I lay the slices on a dish towel, cover them with another one, pat them between the layers of cloth and gently roll them as pictured. This all takes less than a minute but makes all the difference in the world. Randolph’s main emphasis is on clean fat and clean pans and on the final result being crisp. The lard I used is from a batch of home rendered organic lard that I keep in my freezer. You can use canola oil if you prefer, or corn oil or peanut oil. Each type adds its own unique flavor to fried foods. \xa0Of course neither she nor her cooks had a thermometer to gauge the heat of the oil so they would be watching for the oil be hot enough to have a definite shimmer on its surface – not smoking – but as Randolph describes it “still.” There is no sense that this recipe is new or unusual in her repertory, she expects the cook to be able to ‘send them up’ with confidence. The lard (or oil) can be strained, refrigerated, or frozen in a jar and reused several times. Your email address will not be published.

They use those gadgets that peel and spirally cut apples. I think though that the potatoes were also battered. I\'ve never heard of frying peels of potato before. I\'ll have to try it. Now I wonder if ancient South Americans, who gave us the potato, ever fried them. Useless but entertaining information.Oddly enough, yesterday I was working with a chap who taught me that \'Chips\' in Welsh are \'sglodion\'.Commonly known as \'sglods\'In Cornish, they are \'scubmaw\', which sounds more like a peasant-y soup. The rules that I\'ve read for Saratoga chips include a step not mentioned in the other recipes, which was to soak the sliced potato in ice water for a time, then dry it thoroughly before dropping it into the fat.  Would the removal of exterior starch make a crisper product? Interesting, Piet. The old hoary tale of the origin of Saratoga chips stresses the thinness, not the ice-water technique. I have seen this in other fried potato recipes and suspect it has its origins in the necessity to put cut up potato into water to keep it from browning, until it is ready for use. I dont know when it became ice-water that was recommended though. yet another thing to look into! Wonderful articles - always enjoy seeing what treasure you unearth next. Thanks always for your work!

I must try to find it and put it aside for a lazy afternoon!', 'The origins of fish and chips is not entirely clear. Fried fish was first introduced and sold by East End Jews, while chips first took off in Lancashire and Yorkshire. But we may never know who was the first to bring the magical combination together. Originally, Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to ‘Pescado frito’, which is coated in flour. Battered fish is coated in flour and dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid, usually water but sometimes beer. Some newer modifications to the recipe may add cornflour, and sometimes use soda water instead of beer. The potato came to the British Isles in the sixteenth century. While there is an ongoing dispute between France and Belgium about where ‘fries’ were invented, fried potato chips have long been popular in England. William Kitchiner\'s cookbook The Cook\'s Oracle, first published in 1817, includes the earliest known recipe for something similar to today\'s potato chips. 1863? - Alternatively, it is believed that entrepreneur John Lees was selling fish and chips out of a wooden hut at Mossley market in industrial Lancashire, near Oldham. 1875-77 - The earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. 1899 - Alfred Hitchcock was born. As a boy he lived above a fish and chip shop in London, which was the family business. 1937 - In The Road to Wigan Pier, George Orwell wrote about fish and chips as the first among the home comforts that helped keep the masses happy and ""averted revolution"". 1939 – 1945 - During World War II, ministers made sure fish and chips were one of the few foods that were never rationed. 1980s - Portions were often wrapped in old newspaper to keep prices down. This practice survived as late as the 1980s when it was ruled unsafe for food to come into contact with newspaper ink without grease-proof paper in between. These days, burgers, fried chicken, pizza, Indian and Chinese dishes all now compete with fried fish. However, the dish is still highly popular - especially at the seaside.']","The earliest known recipe for something similar to today's potato chips is in William Kitchiner's cookbook The Cook's Oracle, first published in 1817, which was a bestseller in England and the United States.

when did china give hong kong to britain,"['Although Hong Kong & Macau are famous internationally, however, these 2 cities are just play the role as Left Right ""Body Guard"" of Water Mouth to Guangzhou. Hong Kong and Macau were just fishing villages before the arrival of Portuguese and later English in 16th & 17th century, while, Guangzhou has been a township since 2000 years ago........... Portuguese merchants settled in Macau and governed themselves since the time of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), first establishing a foothold in 1535, though Portugal’s involvement was only formalized by the Qing Dynasty in 1749. Following the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking, the emboldened Portuguese Governor made an attempt to govern the Chinese citizens of Macau, by expelling Qing authorities on Macau in 1846, but the Governor was assassinated. After the Second Opium War, the Portuguese government, along with a British representative, signed the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking that gave Portugal sovereignty over Macau, with the caveat that Portugal would cooperate with anti-smuggling efforts against opium. The transfer of sovereignty of Macau from the Portuguese Republic to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) occurred on 20 December 1999. The transfer of the sovereignty of Macau was a significant historical event in Macau, as it returned Macau to the People’s Republic of China. Because the transfer and the idea of one country, two systems were considered to be successful, the Macau Special Administrative Region, the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary were all put into practice accordingly under the regulation of the Basic Law. Hong Kong’s territory was acquired from three separate treaties: the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Treaty of Beijing in 1860, and The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898, which gave the United Kingdom the control of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon (area south of Boundary Street), and the New Territories (area north of Boundary Street and south of the Shenzhen River, and outlying islands), respectively. Although Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the control on the New Territories was a 99-year lease. The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People’s Republic of China, referred to as ‘the Return’ or ‘the Reunification’ by the Chinese and ‘the Handover’ by others, took place on 1 July, 1997. The event marked the end of British rule, and the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. The Qi is running towards South East. What does this mean? Which Period Circle is Auspicious?

All Rights Reserved.', 'Let’s face some home truths, be frank and honest with ourselves when trade unions put some questions to UKIP members and their leadership what are their policies regards to a well-established trade unions and trade movement at large most of UKIP membership and their great leader are clueless on what their basic policies are on trade unions rights let alone to give a position on it. Since the formation of UKIP all they are concerned about is out of European Parliament, stopping immigrants entering the UK and they want a referendum now. Err hello welcome to Cloud coo land they seem to forget it was the trade unions who fought tooth and nail to secure trade union rights to be recognised both in Europe and UK via Labour MEPs which a Labour Government has delivered and many trade unions members have benefited so why would the trade unions throw in the towel and embrace UKIP it makes no sense. All the trade unions who are affiliated to the TUC have concurred that UKIP has nothing to offer to the trade union membership. If anything they foresaw that UKIP would rather be bed partners with the conservatives to help them to implement Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\xa0(TTIP) /Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) \xa0which will see the end of our NHS and Local Government under the guise of Jaws of Doom to put it in a nutshell which many UKIP members brags about today as this article goes to print. This what some UKIP members had to say about the general policy for UKIP about the trades unions, or even if it has a policy concerning that matter. As a true libertarian party, UKIP would have to accept trade union membership of it’s supporters. As a Kipper myself, I have nothing to hide, and can confirm that I am a fully paid up member of a large Trade Union, and have been for many years. I personally see that they do ‘mainly’ good things to represent workers and help improve working conditions and help make the workplace safe, as well as negotiating pay deals and work benefits. Although I do not support wild cat strikes like they used to have in the 70s, or indeed the national ‘general strike’ that was called for by the big union bosses the other week. the other UKIP member said I am a fully paid up member of UKIP and was a Candidate on Thursday. I am not currently a member of a trade union but was for several years with a union which I joined when I worked for BT.\xa0Unions are important, but we would be wise to avoid being ruled by them. We certainly need to avoid, like labour, being dependant on them. Unions have great power and when used wisely it can benefit everyone, when union leaders will not compromise or accept certain arguments, life can get pretty difficult. They key is to be honest with them and for them to be honest with whomsoever they are representing and or negotiating with. No party can guarantee that a particular policy will be agreed with by the Unions, but if the policy is correct, then the argument should be made and those unhappy either convinced about them, or allowed to make their argument and in some cases seek a compromise. There will be cases when compromise cannot be reached, if this is so, then the reason for that lack of compromise should be clear cut and at the end of the day justified. Trade\xa0union campaigners have launched a drive against the far-right UK Independence Party (UKIP) just before he European elections. The Unions Together campaign will aim to highlight that as well as Ukip’s divisive immigration policies, the party also stands for a series of reactionary reforms, supporting the rollback of basic workers’ rights such as maternity leave, sick pay and paid holidays. The announcement comes a day after a protester was arrested for throwing an egg at Ukip leader Nigel Farage. “Ukip will take Britain’s working people back to the dark ages, scrapping basic rights we fought hard for and relied upon by the 31 million workers in this country,” said GMB general secretary Paul Kenny. “This is a chance to show that Ukip’s agenda, specially its small-business manifesto, is far from being in touch with Britain’s common people. “It’s a brilliant idea,” said Unite community activist Bernadette Horton about the campaign. “People only see the immigration issue and are blind to all the other things that Ukip wants to do. “Ukip want to decimate the public sector,” Ms Horton added. “I’m a full-time carer and the cuts have already been bad enough.” Less than a week ago Nigel Farage’s party stood up for an Exeter member who publicly argued women should “stay at home.” A Unions Together van will be spreading the message “Don’t let Ukip steal what matters to you” across south-east England over the bank holiday weekend. In those heady days after 1997, Labour put into action many of the policies devised in opposition. We started to improve the NHS (do you remember how people used to die on the waiting list for a heart op?). We brought in the minimum wage. We set up Sure Start centres for young children and Connexions for older ones. And we brought human rights home by passing the Human Rights Act. The European Convention on Human Rights was not devised by foreigners in a far off land. The UK was fully involved in its development and a Conservative MP, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, oversaw the drafting. We signed the Convention over 60 years ago. But asserting your rights by going to the European Court of Human Rights could be a cumbersome process, with cases at home backed up and waiting for the decision. So, in consultation with lawyers and judges, Labour passed the Human Rights Act. We all benefit from the Human Rights Act. The Countryside Alliance used the Human Rights Act to challenge the ban on fox hunting. Elderly couples can no longer be separated by care homes hat used to be common practice. Human rights have been used to protect our privacy; to confirm that we cannot be tried and convicted without knowing the evidence against us; to stop innocent people from having their DNA stored indefinitely; to prevent discrimination. This Tory/LibDem government and with the possibility of a UKIP/Conservative coalition has not been good at protecting civil liberties: from cuts to civil legal aid, changes to judicial review and the ‘gagging act’ we have gone backwards on a number of fronts. And now the Tories are promising to repeal the Human Rights Act and to pull out of the Convention if they stay in government next year. We should be proud of our Human Rights Act. It is the mark of a civilised democracy. Of course, some decisions might not be popular. Some decisions might criticise the government of the day. But that’s really the point. We all benefit when government is more accountable, when we are all recognised as being equal and possessing inherent human rights. I’m not surprised there have been two defections from two Conservatives Member of Parliament to UKIP and five members of Conservatives who were elected in 2010 will be standing down as one of them will go onto challenge the leadership in the near future. This may be claptrap to some quarters of UKIP members rest assure it’s in the pipeline. Thank you Congress. It’s an honour to address you for the first time today. Let me begin by paying tribute to your General Secretary, Frances, who is doing a fantastic job leading this movement. Keeping us on our toes. And fighting for social justice in this country. Today I’d like to speak about the importance of this movement and our shared mission to build a new economy. But as my time is limited, I won’t be able to cover all I want to say but will be happy to deal with anything I don’t address in the Q&A. So to start with – a simple statement: I am a proud trade union member. Out of choice and out of conviction. I don’t come from a family with a history of labour trade union activism. But my Dad – a self made man – always supported this movement and voted Labour Let me tell you why.\xa0 He arrived in this country, in this very City in fact – at Liverpool Docks – in the mid-1960s, after a long boat journey from Nigeria. It took some courage. Not just because he was leaving everything he knew, but also because he couldn’t swim – if the ship went down, he was going to go with it.\xa0 And he was sea sick for the entire journey. But, carrying only a battered suitcase, he made it. He came here – like so many immigrants – to create a better life for himself and to make a contribution. But, like every other person of colour in 1960s Britain, he faced rampant discrimination. Remember the famous signs on hostel windows: “no Irish, no blacks, no dogs”. The reason my entrepreneur father supported this movement – in fact his hero was Harold Wilson – was simple: this movement gave him a chance. The reason those racist signs came down and my father got his opportunity was because of the trade unionists and Labour Governments leading the charge for equalities legislation in the 60s and 70s. That, Congress, is why I’m so proud to be speaking here today. Too easily, people forget the impact this movement has had. Sometimes in Westminster, you just shake your head at some of the rubbish you have to sit through. Government Members, week after week, smearing and denigrating our trade unions. Just think: they’ve had this big push to appoint more women ministers – which is great, yet they seem to forget that these very same Conservative women have benefitted from the right to equal pay, equal rights and all the other social reforms that this movement worked so tirelessly to introduce. So they attack the very people who helped remove the barriers to their progress. It’s a disgrace and it must stop. Maybe they think it’s pro-business to attack you. But just as I am clear that you can’t be pro-worker if you don’t back the businesses that create decent jobs; you cannot be pro-business if you constantly attack the rights and representative organisations of the people who work in our businesses. Pro-worker, pro-business – that is the right approach. After all, many of the most successful companies in the FTSE100 are the ones that recognise the important role of trade unions and your members. And it’s an approach that’s going to be more important than ever in the future. As a movement, we’ve always worked to ensure the right balance of power between those who have and those who do not. That ideal endures. But – let’s face it – the context in which we seek to achieve social justice – to ensure people have good, fulfilling work – is changing. We’ve all seen the winds of change blowing through towns and communities across Britain. The emerging economies of the South and East are posing greater competition than ever to our firms and our workers. New technologies are transforming how business is done.\xa0 Yes, creating new jobs, but also making many of the jobs people have done for generations disappear; and the new jobs are not always better jobs. And, the thing is, we cannot stop this change: we can’t stop the rise of international competition. We can’t stop the onward march of technology. Doing so through protectionist measures, for example, would be entirely counter-productive. But we can and we must shape these forces of change together to build the kinds of jobs and the better future we want for our children, our families, our communities. We must ensure our firms are the ones producing and creating those new technologies the world wants, enabling us to pay our way in the world, building an economy of good jobs and higher wages for all. And Congress, for this we need you. Too often, trade unions only come to prominence in the media when things reach crisis point: during difficult pay negotiations, when a plant is under threat, during a dispute. That essential role for trade unions will continue. But we need unions to be engaged not just in times of dispute or crisis. But much earlier, in a continuous discussion, shaping the process of change. Working with our businesses to transform themselves, harness new technologies and compete with India, China and beyond. So at the level of each firm, we must be ready for these kinds of discussion – as I know you are – and we need employers engaging with you, including you in this process.\xa0 Promoting investment in people and the business, so we are producing goods and services each business can sell to the world.\xa0 I am clear: adding value is what this movement does for our economy. And this approach is needed at the level of each industry sector too.\xa0 It is essential trade unions are included and play an active part on different sector bodies in shaping the different industrial strategies we have.\xa0 And Government must of course play its role in the implementation of a those industrial strategies across all departments, bringing employers and union representatives together to help forge that future.\xa0 Resolutely backing those sectors where we have a competitive edge or might do in the future. That’s not happening right now. Look at the defence industry, where the Government abandoned UK firms at the start of this Parliament to buy kit off the shelf from the US. Look at renewables and the damage caused by their u-turn on Feed in Tariffs.\xa0 Look at pharmaceuticals, where they were happy to waive through the takeover of our second biggest firm, AstraZeneca, by Pfizer, a firm with a record of intellectually asset stripping companies and cutting R&D investment. As Ed Miliband says, we can and must do better than this.\xa0 And under Labour our long-term plan for growth with industrial strategy at its core – we call it “Agenda 2030” – will animate the whole of government, backing our businesses and those working within them. A strategic and strong pro-worker, pro-business agenda that has us all working together – employers, trade unions and government – to ensure the UK and all of our people succeed. It’s the only way we will rise to the challenge of building a new economy for this modern, global world. Now, the Conservatives don’t understand this: that you have to build an economy – not on the stress fractures of conflict – but on the firm foundations of collaboration. They see workers as a threat to be controlled, not as the inspiration for everything our companies achieve. They see unions as a brake on our nation’s success, not as partners in building the new shared and fair economy we need. They say we’re all in this together but their actions seek to divide and rule. And don’t even get me started on UKIP, who take this division to a whole new level.\xa0 We can’t meet the challenges our nation faces by setting our communities against each other, by scapegoating and blaming.\xa0 The rhetoric which seeps out of that party in respect of our fellow Europeans is not at all dissimilar from the rhetoric deployed against black and Asian people in times past. We will not stand for it. And that’s why when people argue that we’re all the same.\xa0 I am resolute in my view that we are not.\xa0 Because the Tory way, the UKIP way is not the Labour way of doing things. Labour is a political party built on the power of common endeavour, the value of collaboration, the importance of solidarity, respecting people’s rights and ensuring they have a voice. That’s why I’m proud we voted down the move by Tory MPs to abolish trade union facilities time in this Parliament. It’s why I’m proud we saw off the threat of Adrian Beecroft’s compensated no-fault dismissals. It’s why I’m proud we blocked the proposal by Vince Cable and his ministers to end the Equality & Human Rights Commission’s duty to promote equality. Above all it’s why I’m proud to say we will do what this Government has refused to: launch a full enquiry, held publically, into the inexcusable blacklisting of workers in the construction sector.\xa0 Let me be clear.\xa0 If am given the privilege of serving as Business Secretary in the next Labour Government we will deliver justice to those workers who lost their livelihoods and end blacklisting for once and for all. Labour beliefs – not just in words but, proudly, in our actions too. And in Government, you will see our beliefs in action too. We have fought to defend people’s rights and voice in opposition but these rights are only meaningful if you can get proper redress.\xa0 The current employment tribunal system is unfair, unsustainable and has resulted in prohibitive costs locking people out of the justice they are entitled to. Affordability should not be a barrier to workplace justice. But it would be a mistake to simply return to the system of the past, where tribunals were so slow that meaningful justice was not available. So if we are elected the next Labour Government will abolish the current system, reform the employment tribunals and put in place a new system which ensures all workers have proper access to justice. Openness and respect. Rights and justice under a future Labour Government. It is this same drive for social justice that has driven our commitment to restoring the value of the national minimum wage, alongside increased fines and better enforcement, to incentivise employers to pay a living wage, to outlaw exploitative zero hours contracts.\xa0 Because if you work hard – day in, day out – you shouldn’t have to live in poverty or have insecurity heaped upon you. And there is more. We will take action to ensure agency workers are properly protected and that there are no exemptions from equal treatment on pay including by ending the Swedish derogation from the Agency Regulations.\xa0 We will extend the remit of the Gangmasters Licencing Authority. But all of this will only happen if a Labour Government is elected. And I should say: if you live in Scotland, the SNP would have you believe that social justice can be achieved by voting for separation.\xa0 But when asked what measures in their White Paper redistribute money and power from those who have it and to those who do not, they have no answer because there are none.\xa0 Instead they are committed to a further 3p reduction in corporation tax for the biggest and wealthiest companies. Congress, there is only one way to achieve better social justice in this United Kingdom and that is through this pro-worker pro-business agenda I have talked about which the election of a Labour Government will deliver not separation. To finish, I’d like to go back to the beginning. When my father arrived here in Liverpool, he was filled with hope and ambition. That’s what this country represented to him – and what it proved. Due to your work in protecting his rights, the infrastructure this country provided and his ability to see the opportunity in the world – he was able to make it. That simple story of hope, hard work, rights, opportunity and success is what we want for all of our people. That we can lead lives where tomorrow is better than today and we can give our children more than we had. Let’s work together – in solidarity – to make that happen. Thank you. Congress continues to be deeply concerned at the effects of the government’s austerity agenda which has already resulted in over 13 million people living in poverty with around five million people still earning below the living wage (currently standing at £7.65 an hour). Congress condemns the fact that 10 per cent of our young people live with a level of social and economic deprivation that creates educational barriers which blight the life chances of a significant proportion of our next generation. Congress notes that, at a time of increasing poverty and austerity for the many, the UK is now the fourth richest nation in the world (GDP/capita) with the wealthiest 1,000 people in the UK currently worth over £518bn, an increase of 13 per cent since 2013. Congress also notes with concern that the recession and the increases in poverty and inequality which come in its wake have also led to an upsurge in racism and xenophobia in the UK and across the whole of Europe. Congress notes with concern the advance of UKIP and other even more right-wing, xenophobic and outright racist parties in the 2014 European Parliamentary elections. Congress continues to reject the policies put forward by such organisations, including on immigration. Congress notes the deep disillusionment with mainstream politics revealed by the results of the 2014 elections. In particular, low turnout assisted UKIP to considerable gains. UKIP’s true agenda stands counter to the interests of working people of all backgrounds. UKIP have previously called for the elimination of virtually all workplace protections, with employees’ rights wholly dependent on the goodwill of the employer. UKIP have also called in the past for the privatisation of schools and hospitals and a flat rate of income tax, policies that would be disastrous for low-paid and working class people. Their success has damaged mainstream politics, leading to more punitive measures against migrant workers, legitimising racist rhetoric and attacks against vulnerable workers. While UKIP preys on economic anxieties, Congress believes that the only real answer to low pay and exploitation is stronger employment rights protections and trade union solidarity. Congress asserts that trade unionists are uniquely positioned to challenge such propaganda. Congress calls on the General Council, affiliated unions and others to continue to campaign vigorously against organisations who have no contribution to make to improving the living standards and quality of life of the millions of people suffering from the impact of austerity cuts imposed by various governments across Europe. Congress is also critical of the UK right-wing media’s obsessively prejudicial coverage of immigration issues characterised by exaggeration, lies and half-truths – including increased pressure on our schools, hospitals and other public services.\xa0 Congress rejects this analysis and instead recognises the enormous positive contribution generations of migrants have made to the UK economy and society. Indeed, many areas of employment including vital services like the NHS and public transport would suffer greatly were it not for the hard work and commitment of migrant workers. Congress rejects attempts to pit UK workers against migrant workers or claimants. It rejects the divide and rule rhetoric and notes that migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. Congress further notes that UK benefits are among the lowest in Europe, making claims of ‘benefit tourism’ ridiculous Congress is also concerned about the opportunity for unscrupulous employers to exploit migrant workers as a cheap source of labour to undercut people’s pay and pensions and considers this is the real problem that mainstream politicians need to address. Congress calls on the General Council to continue to fight for a more humane immigration policy. This, together with better employment rights for all workers and the reversal of austerity cuts, will help defeat racism, prejudice and discrimination. Congress, therefore, calls on the General Council to: Continue its campaigning work to combat the structural inequalities that lead to poverty, including support for the establishment of the living wage across the economy. Continue to counter the racist anti immigration propaganda that originates in the overtly racist parties and groups in the UK but which is now being adopted by some of the established mainstream parties. There have been many of us who been campaigning together to protect our NHS for years now. many of us want an decent NHS we can rely on. We want everyone in Britain to have great health care. Whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, wherever you live – we should all get decent treatment whenever we need it. So we need the NHS to be properly funded. And we need it run as a public service that puts patients first – not the profit of private companies. Today, bosses at NHS England unveiled their five-year blueprint for the NHS. [1] I listened closely, because I know how much it matters to 38 Degrees members. Here are the headlines: They make a very strong case for why the NHS needs better funding. They explained why the NHS needs billions of pounds more than any of the politicians have promised – and set out grave risks to the quality of our health care if this doesn’t happen.\xa0They haven’t ruled out more privatisation. This is worrying, and proves that we need to do more to campaign against privatisation. The government clearly sees 38 Degrees as the main organisation fighting to protect the NHS and stop their privatisation plans. That’s a huge responsibility. I know that protecting the NHS will be a long-term task for the many. We need to push politicians to promise enough funding. And we need to push the politicians to drop their obsession with handing contracts to dodgy private companies. [3] At the same time we need to keep running the shorter term campaigns to protect the NHS – like saving Lewisham Hospital, or stopping privatisation at the Dorchester General. [4] Not to mention blocking the outrageous plan to sell our medical records to private companies. [5] Scale up our anti-privatization\xa0work. We could block more local proposals to\xa0privatize\xa0hospitals and services. We could launch fresh investigations to expose private companies when they provide bad care. I would strongly all to put every MP, and candidates, under pressure to promise to fund the NHS properly and tell us exactly how they’d pay for it. Some may have witnessed on \xa0television or may have been in the public gallery in Parliament or read via press recently at the Prime Minister Questions Time (PMQs) when Ed Miliband put some questions to the Prime Minister regarding the NHS in the reply was about the NHS in Wales. This clearly shows that David Cameron has decided to tackle the greater confidence in Labour over health matters by what I can only describe as attacking the NHS in Wales. There is no doubt whichever way we look at this NHS does needs more levels of funding and I give credit where it’s due during the thirteen years of a Labour government they invested more than any current coalition into the NHS however more can be done. I am sure of one thing I would rather put my trust in Labour when it comes to ensuring that we have the right investments in our NHS which Labour has a very good track record for investment.\xa0Intriguingly patients, health professionals, and voters are united in opposition to the internal market and top down\xa0re-organisation\xa0imposed on the health service in England by the conservative coalition. Let’s not forgot that the Heath budget in Wales is subject to the Barnett formula block grant from Whitehall to Cardiff Bay that short changed Wales by the sum of £300 Million a year and which the\xa0Westminster\xa0establishment coalition cut by 10% which this coalition conveniently left out in their reply to the opposition leader. If funds were based on need rather than population as Lord Barnett proposed the Welsh government would be better placed to increase NHS spending. David Cameron seems to have forgotten that he has a coalition partner viz Nick Clegg and do seem to imagine it’s the conservative government who is running the country \xa0 and he is the Prime Minister who speaks for all. Just after the Scottish referendum David Cameron and other\xa0Westminster\xa0party leaders welcomed the No vote in Scotland that he is in a position to take a pop at the Welsh patients treated in hospitals in England and vice – versa. I’m sure that David Cameron’s insinuation(s) is that if four times as many residents in Wales this must be true and must represent a choice based on qualitative criteria. Surly he must be aware that countries cannot be compared in population wealth and number of hospitals let alone specialist units which makes up the NHS ie Learning Difficulties, Mental Health, physical disabilities, and dementia and the list goes on. It is deteriorating swiftly with hospitals weighed down by debts and care service at near breaking point. Tory and FibDems opposition to our NHS public service ethos based on paramountcy of private profits is very lethal to health services throughout Britain and must be rejected on 7 May 2015 How many people has the feeling that David Cameron will drive a wedge between his party and our NHS and Europe hence it’s little wonder why two of the backbenchers defected to UKIP and some of his MPs who were elected in 2010 are stepping down making way for a more right wing agenda. Its comes as no surprise when Secretary Jeremy Hunt was challenged to end the Tories’ NHS England cash freeze yesterday after he was warned it faces meltdown due to a looming £30 billion-a-year hole. In Westminster Labour shadow minister Andy Burnham pummelled his Tory counterpart at the dispatch box following the release of a five-year blueprint by NHS organisations which warned that “efficiency” savings alone would not be enough. A grinning Mr Hunt labelled the report “essentially positive and optimistic” but brushed off calls to invest more cash. Mr Burnham, whose party has pledged a £2.5bn-a-year above-inflation funding rise, retorted: “The report could not be clearer — simply protecting the NHS budget in the next Parliament as the Conservatives propose will not prevent it tipping into a full-blown crisis.” The joint report by six bodies, including watchdogs Monitor and the Care Quality Commission and NHS England itself, speculates that new technology, restructured community services and better public education could make the service “more productive” and reduce a projected £30bn annual funding shortfall. It set out sweeping plans for GP practices to hire hospital doctors, to allow hospitals to provide GP services to plug gaps, to merge the back-office functions of smaller facilities, and to encourage bigger hospitals to open franchises in smaller ones. But even the most optimistic estimates set out in their “forward view” would leave a £16bn-a-year gap if the government continues its planned real-terms budget freeze. And trade union Unite head of health Rachael Maskell said that the real picture would be worse because the plan’s cash-saving goals simply could not be achieved in time. The service is already struggling with existing demands for annual “efficiency” savings that have seen £20bn drained from budgets since 2010, she said. And she warned the NHS plan “will be impossible to deliver in five years if you are talking about a real improvement in health prevention, retraining and realigning the roles of NHS staff, together with integration of health and social care. “The best investment that the government could make in the NHS is the immediate scrapping of the Health and Social Care Act which has already squandered £3bn in a pointless reorganisation.” The NHS blueprint states that continuing current inflation-only budget rises would lead to a massive black hole even if the service succeeded in finding more ways to cut costs.\xa0It predicts a £21bn annual shortfall if the current “efficiency” drive to find 0.8 per cent savings a year continued and funding remained in line with inflation. That gap could narrow to £16bn if savings increased to 1.5 per cent a year and the budget remained flat. But NHS England would only meet costs by 2020-21 if a hugely ambitious 2-3 per cent annual cost-saving target totalling £22bn was met and real-terms funding rose by £8bn a year. The Jaws of doom just\xa0don’t\xa0affect Local Government but it will also affect our NHS under The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) if the Conservatives and UKIP coalition or Conservatives and Fibdems coalition after the general election on 7 May 2015. Nor can I defend or even justify The boss of the NHS in England has defended the privatisation of services as a way of helping patients get treatment but insisted that the health service would continue to do most of the work. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said that “sometimes there will be a case” for a patient needing, for example, a hip operation to use a private provider paid by the NHS and stressed that patients should decide themselves who should treat them. He was responding on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme to questions about the NHS put by its listeners, many of which involved the outsourcing of NHS clinical services. Stevens, an ex-Labour government health adviser under Tony Blair, started in the NHS’s top job on 1 April after 10 years working for UnitedHealth, an American private health firm. Asked if it was his intention to have more private companies delivering care, he replied: “No. Most services in this country are delivered by the NHS and that’s going to continue to be the case under any foreseeable future. But the tests we should be applying are that we think like a patient and act like a taxpayer and sometimes there will be a case for whether you need a hip operation [being done in the private sector, but paid for by the NHS.” Many of you will have noticed that the right-wing press never want to report\xa0Britain\xa0needs a pay rise as they had no choice but to report it could it be that they want to see a Conservative and UKIP coalition.\xa0 I can only come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter as those marchers are a bunch of hard lefties. This demonstration also took place in Glasgow, and Belfast to coincide with England people from all walks of life turned up to show their anger at this vile coalition who are offering a below inflation 1% whilst Members of Parliament are happy to receive their pay increase which amounts to 11% in 2015 and the European Parliament MEPs gets €96,246 which does not includes their benefits. Midwives who took strike action this week for the first time ever are among tens of thousands of trade unionists taking to the streets of London and no one can claim that they don’t know the value of labour. A march from the Thames Embankment to Hyde Park will see heroic trade unionists joined by students, housing campaigners, anti-nuclear activists and many others in calls for a new politics of hope at the TUC’s Britain Needs a Pay Rise march and rally. Meanwhile thousands more are expected to join a sister march and rally taking place in Glasgow dubbed A Just Scotland: Decent Work, Dignified Lives. The demonstration comes after half a million workers in the NHS downed tools this week in the first health strike since the Thatcher era and low-paid civil servants brought government to a standstill. Members of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), which is not affiliated to the TUC, received an ecstatic message from the union’s chief executive Cathy Warwick urging them to take to the streets. She said: “I really encourage those that can make it to join us on Saturday so that we can show the government just how strong their feelings are and how much support there is for fair pay. “Our members are not asking to be paid like bankers, just for a fair reward for the work they do. Enough’s enough and now is the time to take a stand.” TUC research has found the average worker is now a whopping £50 a week worse off than in 2007. On the\xa017 October the TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady, said she will address crowds in Hyde Park launched a rallying cry for a fairer Britain. “After the longest and deepest pay squeeze in recorded history, it’s time to end the lock-out that has kept the vast majority from sharing in the economic recovery. “An economy that finds money for tax cuts for the rich and boardroom greed, while the rest face a pay squeeze and big cuts to the welfare system that any of us might need is no longer working for the many.” And lecturers’ union UCU leader Sally Hunt will use her speech in Hyde Park to blast the “narrow nationalism” of Ukip. “Britain needs more than just a pay rise, we need real change,” she is set to say. I have to say that I’m intrigued to say which I don’t normally do even the \xa0private sector workers have taken to the streets on 18 October they also belong to trade unions. \xa0Also public sector workers pay the same tax as everyone else. It is also wrong to say public sector are not wealth creators a very narrow view. \xa0My local authority for example works with the business sector to help enable growth in businesses be they large or small, we are also putting in reserves to create business opportunity that is wealth creation. Never in this country have those who fight for democracy and social justice carried a greater burden or faced the possibility of bigger losses of human rights, human freedoms, human dignity and wellbeing than they do right now. As the poor and disabled suffer and have to pick up the crumbs from the dining tables of the fatcats, and bankers. They rather put their finance in offshore accounts rather than paying their fair share of taxes. Yet the The TaxPayers’ Alliance have produced a\xa0report, and assisted \xa0by Harry Phibbs concerning the vast amount of space Trade unions are provided with in public sector buildings – at little of now charge. It amounted to at least 273,753 square feet in 2013-14. This is more than the total floor space of the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow nothing more than a distraction as to why the trade union members when on strike on 18 October which they play into the hands of Conservatives and UKIP. Let us all not forget It was your government that lost us the triple A Fitch and Moody credit rating, inflicted socially and economically damaging austerity on only the poorest, whilst handing out our money to the millionaires, and your government that borrowed more money in 4 years than Labour did in 13. And Labour had the global recession caused by irresponsible bankers to deal with. And they did. No austerity cuts from them. We were out of recession in 2010, and you, Mr Cameron, with YOUR government’s policies that manufacture gross wealth inequalities, caused another recession. Be a man. Tell the truth. I say to them we will fight them at the hustings, we will fight them at the ballot box; we will fight them for the minds of the People. We shall never surrender. In 2015 if people let the Tories win the only thing they will guarantee is years and years of more austerity. On such a scale that it will scare the UK in such a way it will never recover. That is the stark truth. The Tories want to destroy social justice, equality and fairness. Their overriding plan is to sell of every single public service to private companies. Regardless of standards, commitments to service, protection for those least able to get by and with no regard to the real economic impact having hundreds of thousands more people on the dole.\xa0Have no doubt this is what the Tories want and are hoping you will fall for it all over again. They want another £20 billion in cuts. That is on top of the multi billions already taken away. Now no matter the lies and spin the cuts have done nothing to bring down the deficit and that money seems to just vanish, but it’s going somewhere? When people say there is no difference between the political parties they really need to think before they say that. The only hope every single public service and public sector worker have is with Labour winning in 2015. If not then what is happening now will seem tame in comparison. I seem to recall between 1987 -1996 in my former trade union debating the Handover of Hong Kong to China which I recommended to my former trade union Conference for reference back I remember there was a very big split on the debate. I make no apologies for allowing the debate to take place and in one sense I was glad that I had the opportunity to state my case by informing delegates the mover was anti-China as the mover was pro Hong Kong and I was and still am pro-China and I felt that the motion was one-sided and it was by applying the common sense approach which won the day and the motion was put to the vote and reference back won the day. Nobody would have anticipated that this motion caused passionate debates from all sides of the conference and the then president and general secretary got involved which would have not make no difference as the atmosphere was like a us and them at one point as some of the delegates where not engaged with the Chinese political scene as there were on two Chinese members who could really could argue for and against whilst some delegates who thought they knew about the situation but it turned out to be limited with the information as the mover fail to produce the additional information that was required to sway the delegates. Let’s us all not lose focus here for one moment that Hong Kong’s territory was acquired from three separate treaties: the\xa0Treaty of Nanking\xa0in 1842, the\xa0Treaty of Beijing\xa0in 1860, and\xa0The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory\xa0in 1898, which gave the UK the control of\xa0Hong Kong Island,\xa0Kowloon\xa0(area south of\xa0Boundary Street), and the\xa0New Territories\xa0(area north of Boundary Street and south of the\xa0Shenzhen River, and outlying islands), respectively. Although Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the control on the New Territories was a 99-year lease. The finite nature of the 99-year lease did not hinder Hong Kong’s development as the New Territories were combined as a part of Hong Kong. By 1997, it was impractical to separate the three territories and only return the New Territories. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the New Territories were being developed with large-scale\xa0infrastructures\xa0and other developments, with the break-even day lying well past 30 June 1997. Thus, the status of the New Territories after the expiry of the 99-year lease became important for Hong Kong’s economic development. In March 1979, the\xa0Governor of Hong Kong\xa0Murray MacLehose\xa0paid his first official visit to the People’s Republic of China (PRC), taking the initiative to raise the question of Hong Kong’s sovereignty with\xa0Deng Xiaoping. Without clarifying and establishing the official position of the PRC government, the arranging of real estate leases and loans agreements in Hong Kong within the next 18 years would be rather difficult. In fact, as early as the mid-1970s, Hong Kong had faced additional risks raising loans for large scale infrastructure projects such as its\xa0MTR\xa0system and a new airport. Caught unprepared, Deng asserted the necessity of Hong Kong’s return to\xa0China, upon which Hong Kong would be given special status by the PRC government. MacLehose’s visit to the PRC raised the curtain on the issue of Hong Kong’s sovereignty: Britain was made very much aware of the PRC’s aspiration to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and began to make arrangements accordingly to ensure the sustenance of her interests within the territory, as well as initiating the creation of a withdrawal plan in case of emergency. Three years later, Deng received the former\xa0British Prime Minister\xa0Edward Heath. Heath had been dispatched as the special envoy of Prime Minister\xa0Margaret Thatcher\xa0to establish an understanding of the PRC’s view with regards to the question of Hong Kong. Throughout their meeting, Deng stated clearly for the first time the PRC’s willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with Britain through formal\xa0negotiations. In the same year,\xa0Edward Youde, who succeeded MacLehose as the 26th Governor of Hong Kong, led a\xa0delegation\xa0of five\xa0Executive Councillors\xa0to\xa0London, including Chung Sze-yuen,\xa0Lydia Dunn, and\xa0Roger Lobo. Chung presented their position on the sovereignty of Hong Kong to Thatcher, encouraging her to take into consideration the interests of the native Hong Kong population in her upcoming visit to China. In light of the increasing openness of the PRC government and economic reforms on the mainland, then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\xa0sought the PRC’s agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. However, the PRC took a contrary position: not only did the PRC wish for the New Territories, on lease until 1997, to be placed under the PRC’s jurisdiction, it also refused to recognise the “unfair and unequal treaties” under which Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity.[1]\xa0Consequently, the PRC recognised only the British administration in Hong Kong, but not British\xa0sovereignty. In the wake of Governor MacLehose’s visit, Britain and the PRC established initial diplomatic contact for further discussions of the Hong Kong question, paving the way for Thatcher’s first visit to the PRC in September 1982.[2]\xa0Margaret Thatcher, in discussion with Deng Xiaoping, reiterated the validity of an extension of the lease of Hong Kong territory, particularly in light of binding treaties, including the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the\xa0Convention of Peking\xa0in 1856, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1890. In response, Deng Xiaoping cited clearly the lack of room for compromise on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of\xa0Qing Dynasty\xa0and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. During talks with Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the negotiations set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that “I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon”. Thatcher replied that “there is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like”. After her visit with Deng in Beijing, Thatcher was received in Hong Kong as the first British Prime Minister to set foot on the territory whilst in office. At a press conference, Thatcher re-emphasised the validity of the three treaties, asserting the need for countries to respect treaties on universal terms: “treaties ought always to be respected; without such respect, without such necessary trust, it was impossible for any negotiations to take place”. At the same time, at the 5th session of the 5th\xa0National People’s Congress, the constitution was amended to include a new clause which stated that the country might establish a\xa0special administrative region\xa0(SAR) when necessary. The additional clause would hold tremendous significance in settling the question of Hong Kong and later\xa0Macau, putting into social consciousness the concept of “One country, two systems“. A few months after Thatcher’s visit to Beijing, the PRC government had still yet to open negotiations with the British government regarding the sovereignty of Hong Kong. Unsure of what to do, Thatcher consulted former U.S.\xa0Secretary of State\xa0Henry Kissinger, though consultation proved fruitless in the end. Shortly before the initiation of sovereignty talks, Governor Youde declared his intention to represent the population of Hong Kong at the negotiations. This statement sparked a strong response from the PRC, which criticised Britain for “making a three-legged stool” and “playing public-opinion cards” as bargaining chips.[1]\xa0At the preliminary stage of the talks, the British government proposed an exchange of sovereignty for administration and the implementation of a British administration post-handover.\xa0The PRC government refused, contending that the notions of sovereignty and administration were inseparable, and although it recognised Macau as a “Chinese territory under\xa0Portuguese\xa0administration”, it also sought the return of that territory. The conflict that arose at that point of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite clearly on the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution of the issue of Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally. In 1983,\xa0Typhoon Ellen\xa0ravaged Hong Kong, causing great amounts of damage to both life and property. The Hong Kong dollar plummeted onBlack Saturday, and the\xa0Financial Secretary of Hong Kong\xa0John Bremridge\xa0publicly associated the economic uncertainty with the instability of the political climate. In response, the PRC government condemned Britain through the press for “playing the economic cards” in order to achieve their ends: to intimidate the PRC into conceding to British demands. Governor Youde with nine members of the Hong Kong Executive Council travelled to London to discuss with Prime Minister Thatcher the crisis of confidence – the problem with morale among the people of Hong Kong arising from the ruination of the Sino-British talks. The session concluded with Thatcher’s writing of a letter addressed to the PRC Premier\xa0Zhao Ziyang; in it, she expressed Britain’s willingness to explore arrangements optimising the future prospects of Hong Kong while utilising the PRC’s proposals as a foundation. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, she expressed Britain’s concession on its position of a continued British presence in the form of an administration post-handover. Two rounds of negotiations were held in October and November. On the sixth round of talks in November, Britain formally conceded its intentions of either maintaining a British administration in Hong Kong or seeking some form of co-administration with the PRC, and showed its sincerity in discussing PRC’s proposal on the 1997 issue. Obstacles were cleared. Simon Keswick, chairman of\xa0Jardine Matheson & Co., said they were not pulling out of Hong Kong, but a new\xa0holding company\xa0would be established in\xa0Bermuda\xa0instead. He remarked that it was not desirable to “put all of one’s eggs in one basket”. The PRC took this as yet another plot by the British. The Hong Kong government explained that it had been informed about the move only a few days before the announcement. The government would not and could not stop the company from making a business decision. Just as the atmosphere of the talks was becoming cordial, members of the\xa0Legislative Council of Hong Kong\xa0felt impatient at the long-running secrecy over the progress of Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue. They held that the people of Hong Kong should have the right to know what was being discussed and to speak at the talks. A motion,\xa0tabled\xa0by legislator\xa0Roger Lobo, and declaring, “This Council deems it essential that any proposals for the future of Hong Kong should be debated in this Council before agreement is reached”, was passed unanimously. The PRC attacked the motion furiously, referring to it as “somebody’s attempt to play the three-legged stool trick again”.[5]\xa0At length, the PRC and Britain initiated the Joint Declaration on the question of Hong Kong’s future in Beijing.\xa0Zhou Nan, the then PRC Deputy Foreign Minister and leader of the negotiation team, and SirRichard Evans, British Ambassador to Beijing and leader of the team, signed respectively on behalf of the two governments. The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed by the Prime Ministers of the People’s Republic of China and the United Kingdom governments on 19 December 1984 in\xa0Beijing. The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People’s Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the\xa0United Nations\xa0on 12 June 1985. In the Joint Declaration, the People’s Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (includingHong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In the document, the People’s Republic of China Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong. In accordance with the One Country, Two Systems principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People’s Republic of China, the\xa0socialist\xa0system of People’s Republic of China would not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong’s previous\xa0capitalist\xa0system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. The Joint Declaration provides that these basic policies shall be stipulated in the\xa0Hong Kong Basic Law. The ceremony of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration took place at 18:00, 19 December 1984 at the Western Main Chamber of the\xa0Great Hall of the People. The\xa0Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office\xa0at first proposed a list of 60-80 Hong Kong people to attend the ceremony. The number was finally extended to 101. The list included Hong Kong government officials, members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, chairmen of\xa0The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation\xa0and\xa0Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong celebrities such as\xa0Li Ka-shing,\xa0Pao Yue-kong\xa0and\xa0Fok Ying-tung, and also\xa0Martin Lee Chu-ming\xa0and\xa0Szeto Wah The\xa0Basic Law\xa0was drafted by a\xa0Drafting Committee\xa0composed of members from both Hong Kong and mainland China. A\xa0Basic Law Consultative Committee\xa0formed purely by Hong Kong people was established in 1985 to canvas views in Hong Kong on the drafts. The first draft was published in April 1988, followed by a five-month public consultation exercise. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989. The Basic Law was formally promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the\xa0NPC, together with the designs for the flag and emblem of the HKSAR. Some members of the Basic Law drafting committee were ousted by Beijing following the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after voicing views supporting the students. The Basic Law was said to be a mini-constitution drafted with the participation of Hong Kong people. The political system had been the most controversial issue in the drafting of the Basic Law. The special issue sun-group adopted the political model put forward by\xa0Louis Cha. This “main-stream” proposal was criticised for being too conservative. According to Clauses 158 and 159 of the Basic Law, powers of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law are vested in the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress and the National People’s Congress, respectively. Hong Kong’s people have limited influence. Chris Patten\xa0became the last governor of Hong Kong. This was regarded as a turning point in Hong Kong’s history. Unlike his predecessors, Patten was not a\xa0diplomat, but a career politician and former\xa0Member of Parliament. He introduced democratic reforms which pushed PRC-British relations to a standstill and affected the negotiations for a smooth handover. Patten introduced a package of electoral reforms in the\xa0Legislative Council. These reforms proposed to enlarge the electorate, thus making voting in the Legislative Council more democratic. This move posed significant changes because Hong Kong citizens would have the power to make decisions regarding their future. The handover ceremony was held at the new wing of the\xa0Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre\xa0in\xa0Wan Chai\xa0on the night of 30 June 1997. The principal British guest was\xa0Charles, Prince of Wales\xa0who read a farewell speech on behalf of the\xa0Queen. The newly elected\xa0Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,\xa0Tony Blair, the British Foreign Minister\xa0Robin Cook, the departing Hong Kong governor\xa0Chris Patten\xa0and\xa0General Sir Charles Guthrie,\xa0Chief of the Defence Staff of the United Kingdom, also attended. Representing China were the\xa0President of the People’s Republic of China,\xa0Jiang Zemin; and\xa0Tung Chee-hwa, the first Chief Executive of the\xa0Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\xa0of thePeople’s Republic of China. This event was broadcast on several television and radio stations across the world. As much I still look toward for China to make the right move by implementing the Sino-British Joint Declaration. I have to raise my strongest object to China for not listening to student protesters after all they are the future leaders of both Hong Kong and China. There is no doubt that the two tier system has allowed foreign investment to flow into the country which China is hoping to show the western world that they are taking the lead in this field where other communist country has failed. Some will recall the Tinnaman Square incident which many lives were lost and is still raw in people’s memories the Chinese establishment sent out the troops to stop demonstrators from exercising their right for reform in China where not held to account for the injustice of innocent lives for this reason many Chinese internationally does not trust the Chinese regime to allow the flow of democratic free elections and hopefully all over China one day free from interference of vetting of their chosen candidates.\xa0 As here is another part of history which the Chinese establishment would want us to forget if it had its way: After the\xa0Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the\xa0Executive Councillors\xa0and the\xa0Legislative Councillors\xa0unexpectedly held an urgent meeting, requesting that British Government give the right of abode in the United Kingdom to the people of Hong Kong. More than 10,000 Hong Kong residents rushed to\xa0Central\xa0in order to get an application form for residency in the United Kingdom. On the eve of the deadline, over 100,000 lined up overnight for a\xa0BN(O)\xa0application form. While mass migration did begin well before 1989, the event did lead to the peak migration year in 1992 with 66,000. Many citizens were pessimistic towards the future of Hong Kong and the transfer of the region’s sovereignty. A tide of emigration, which was to last for no less than five years, broke out. At its peak,\xa0citizenships\xa0of such small countries as\xa0Cape Verde,\xa0Tonga,\xa0Gambia\xa0and\xa0Ecuador\xa0were also in great demand. Many\xa0consuls\xa0were deported for their\xa0corrupt behaviour\xa0in granting immigration visas. Canada (Vancouver\xa0and\xa0Toronto), United Kingdom (London,\xa0Glasgow, and\xa0Manchester),\xa0Australia\xa0(Sydney\xa0and\xa0Melbourne), and the United States (San Francisco\xa0and\xa0New York) were, by and large, the most popular destinations. The United Kingdom devised the\xa0British Nationality Selection Scheme, granting 50,000 families British citizenship under the\xa0British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990. Vancouver was among the most popular destinations, so much so that\xa0Richmond\xa0(a suburb of Vancouver) earned the nickname of “Little Hong Kong” and “New Chinatown“, and for the city itself, “HongCouver”. Other popular settlements are found in\xa0Auckland,\xa0New Zealand\xa0and\xa0Dublin,\xa0Ireland. All in all, from the start of the settlement of the negotiation in 1984 to 1997, nearly 1 million people emigrated; consequently, Hong Kong suffered serious loss of capital. It is for this reason I call on all international Chinese, and The International Communities to lobby their respective governments to ensure that Chinese Government honour’s its agreement to allow Hong Kong Chinese to have its democratic rights to choose who they want to have as their candidates and not be dictated by the Chinese Government to vet the candidates as to not rock the boat. It clearly shows that china has no idea how to deal with this situation and that they are likely to back track on the agreements signed with the\xa0British Government. https://www.mysociety.org/who-is-your-mp/?gclid=CjwKEAjwns6hBRDTpb_jkbTv1UYSJACBhberTYPkmQXO-B9-ejznXBs1_ckCezuZnd3GA7GhbukjWBoCMYfw_wcB How many have noticed in their own community or region of lately that there has been a housing shortage yet successful governments haven’t addressed the increasing population which need a truly affordable and rentable housing. There are many who feels they(parliamentarians) Walk the walk talk the talk? Over the weekend there has been some announcements how the \xa0political establishments who will provide or address the housing issue which to me has become more of the same in a nutshell more spin doctoring to see who can outdo each other for which I blame both previous and present governments for not doing enough to build housing at affordable prices. I still say that both present and previous governments give a good talk but they never seem to do the walk when it comes to addressing the housing crisis. “People must hold their parliamentarians to account. If we don’t they get away with it.” http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/PRIVATE_RENTED_HOUSING.pdf http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/agenda-2015/policy-review/policy-review/lyons-housing-review The Liberal Democrat policy paper on housing notes that the primary driver of growing housing benefit and Local Housing Allowance bills has been the shortage of housing, leading to higher rents, and increasing number of people unable either to buy or to access social housing. The paper focused on the most pressing issues: Home ownership is becoming more and more out of reach for many. Since the withdrawal of Mortgage Interest Relief for residential homeowners, we have seen a dramatic escalation in house prices and a surge in buy-to-let investors in the housing market. Home ownership is falling and the private rental market is growing – spurred on by rent subsidies and the private rental of former council properties acquired under right to buy schemes. Welfare costs for housing support are all the while increasing dramatically, despite welfare caps and under-occupancy restrictions. Government cannot simply legislate for higher wages that may increase unemployment, lower rents that may reduce housing supply or abandon millions of people to the vagaries of the market.\xa0 So what can be done in addition to the proposals in the Liberal Democrat paper? Firstly, we can focus on increasing wages as a share of GDP by specifically targeting non-inflationary full employment as government policy and driving investment in productivity enhancing infrastructure. Secondly, involuntary unemployment can be reduced with the introduction of a voluntary job guarantee scheme targeted at those currently in need of housing support. Such a scheme would allow for the introduction of a condition of habitual employment as a pre-requisite to eligibility for housing support for the able-bodied. Thirdly, state housing support can be refocused away from rental subsidies and towards capital development, primarily at shared ownership schemes for citizens and long term residents i.e. rent to buy. Combined rental/mortgage payments would be based on a fixed % of annual earnings/income. Equity built-up in the property would be transferable to family members or other eligible participants in the scheme. Fourthly, discounts under the current right to buy scheme can be ended and both new and existing council properties retained in the shared ownership scheme portfolio. Lastly, council tax could be replaced with a national Land Value Tax payable by landlords and owner occupiers on land values over and above a primary residence homestead credit equivalent to the average Band A of council tax. This would aid in both stabilising house and land prices generally and redistributing the burden of council tax more progressively, such that those on very low incomes were better able to afford rents/mortgage payments. The seeds of the next housing bubble have already been planted by Labour’s persistently low rates of housebuilding, so unless we make serious changes now, a wasteful and painful boom and bust cycle could happen again. Our first challenge, therefore, is to deliver enough of the homes people want, in the places people want them, in order to meet Britain’s unmet housing need. The first thrust of our reform will be to abandon the Government’s failed top-down, target-led model of imposing development on communities, which has comprehensively failed to meet this goal. Instead, we will move to a more sustainable system that uses radical new freedoms and powerful incentives to enable communities to deliver the new housing they want and need. The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people. They would be built on brownfield land already identified for development and exempt from some taxes, he said. He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend. Conservative politicians and activists will gather in Birmingham from Sunday for what is the final conference before next May’s general election. Unveiling the pledge – an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme – Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to “achieve the dream” of owning their own home. “I want young people who work hard, who do the right thing, to be able to buy a home of their own. So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value. “They can’t be bought by foreigners, they can’t be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can’t be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40.” The starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide. That scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. “After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership. “Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years.” Campbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was “absolutely vital” that the homes built were “genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes”. “There’s a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,” he said. Grainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed “the focus on supply and affordability” but still had “some serious concerns”. She said: “This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another. “Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis – there are always going to be people who can’t afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too. “Equally, we’d like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities.” Under the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use. Savings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said. Public sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge. The homes would be exempt “from a raft of taxes”, Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development. Some building regulations – including the zero carbon homes standard – would also not apply to the new units. The zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency. It requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services – such as ventilation – in new homes. I had to laugh when I listen to UKIP talked about their housing policy’s the conference only for Nigel Farage to backtrack on it on it on Sunday the Marr Show. I\xa0cannot discover how UKIP feels about letting agent fees or licensing, but after unearthing various manifestos, the subject of immigration certainly makes it mark. The party wants immigration to be controlled so that “large areas of British countryside will not need to be destroyed by house building”. It also proposes that council house applicants whose parents or grandparents were born locally should be given priority. Paul Nuttall, UKIP MEP for the north-west and UKIP deputy leader, has been particularly vocal on the subject, saying that Britain’s “chronic under-supply of homes” is a “crisis fuelled by the unprecedented immigration into our country of the last decade. Nearly nine out of ten new homes required in the UK result from inward immigration. “Unless we withdraw from the European Union, the immigration spiral will continue and the demand for housing will be compounded.” Environment, Planning and Housing: Reduce the pressure on housing by ending open-door immigration. Oppose the bedroom tax, but provide incentives to re-use empty homes. Protect our green spaces by directing new housing and business developments to brown-field sites. Stop preferential treatment to special groups such as travellers – rules should apply equally to us all. This chronic shortage of housing is having an impact across the country.\xa0Young people and families are struggling to get on the property ladder. Those renting privately are now having to pay record sums, on average 41% of their income just to keep a roof over their heads. It’s also affecting those who want to upsize to a bigger home but are finding they can’t bridge the gap between what they own and where they want to move to. And for those who have just joined a waiting list for a social home, there are 1.7 million families already in the queue. That’s why, last year, Ed Miliband set a target for the next Labour government to build over 200,000 homes a year by 2020. It’s a big ambition. But, Labour is determined to make home ownership a realistic aspiration for the next generation.\xa0 We know that there is no single solution to tackling the housing shortage. That is why alongside our ambition, Ed Miliband tasked our housing commission, chaired by Sir Michael Lyons, to draw up a roadmap for achieving this step-change in house building. Labour is determined to tackle the root causes of this crisis. We need to release more land for development. We will ensure that local authorities that want to expand but do not have the land can do so through a right to grow. Alongside this, Labour is determined to reform the land market. We will bring an end to land-banking by giving local authorities the power to levy fines and use proper compulsory purchase powers on those who sit on land with planning permission, so that they have to ‘use it or lose it.’ We also want to support more firms to enter into the market and encourage small-scale and self-build so we can make the most of all opportunities to create a thriving housebuilding industry. That is why, earlier this year, alongside Chris Leslie, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary, I announced the details of Labour’s Help to Build policy specifically designed to help SME builders. In the Federation of Master Builders’ 2013 House Builder Survey, 60 per cent of members cited access to finance as a major barrier to their ability to increase their output of new homes, more than any other factor. So the next Labour Government will provide government guarantees for banks lending to SME construction firms in a similar way to how the current ‘Help to Buy’ scheme underwrites mortgages. By itself, the private sector has never produced the number of homes we need. Therefore, we are also exploring how we can get councils, together with housing associations, back into the business of building again. Labour councils are already blazing a trail. When it comes to getting affordable homes built they are outbuilding their Tory counterparts by 2 to 1. Given the severity of the shortage, we will need some big scale solutions. New Towns and Garden Cities played an important role in delivering housing in the past. The commission will be looking at how new plans for a new generation of New Towns and Garden Cities can be realised in a way that benefits local communities. By contrast the Tories and Lib Dems can only offer more of the same. Their initiatives to boost house building have consistently failed to deliver. The government recently announced a new Garden City in Ebbsfleet and the building of 15,000 homes, but this is 5,000 fewer homes than those announced for the same place in 2012. Their biggest initiative, Help to Buy, is, it is true, helping to boost demand but here the Government hasn’t understood basic economics. Boosting demand without boosting supply will simply see prices pushed out of reach of aspiring buyers. The next Labour government will succeed where this government has failed. Nobody should be in any doubt about our determination to deliver the reforms we need to double house-building, restore the dream of home ownership and to give families the security of a home they can afford.

after the electrical impulse of the heart passes through the av node it travels next to the,"['Ongoing Trials on Electrical conduction system of the heart at Clinical Trials.gov Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1]; Associate Editor-In-Chief: Cafer Zorkun, M.D., Ph.D. [2] The normal electrical conduction in the heart allows the impulse that is generated by the sinoatrial node (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to (and stimulate) the myocardium (Cardiac muscle).  The myocardium contracts after stimulation.  It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped throughout the body. Cardiac muscle has some similarities to neurons and skeletal muscle, as well as important unique properties. Like a neuron, a given myocardial cell has a negative membrane potential when at rest. Stimulation above a threshold value induces the opening of voltage-gated ion channels and a flood of cations into the cell. The positively charged ions entering the cell cause the depolarization characteristic of an action potential. Like skeletal muscle, depolarization causes the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels  and release of Ca2+ from the t-tubules. This influx of calcium causes calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and free Ca2+ causes muscle contraction. After a delay (the absolute refractory period), Potassium channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarization to the resting state. Note that there are important physiological differences between nodal cells and ventricular cells; the specific differences in ion channels and mechanisms of polarization give rise to unique properties of SA node cells, most importantly the spontaneous depolarizations necessary for the SA node\'s pacemaker activity . Signals arising in the SA node stimulate the atria to contract and travel to the AV node. After a delay, the stimulus is conducted through the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular epicardium. Microscopically, the wave of depolarization propagates to adjacent cells via gap junctions located on the intercalated disk. The heart is a syncytium: electrical impulses propagate freely between cells in every direction, so that the myocardiam functions as a single contractile unit. This property allows rapid, synchronous depolarization of the myocardium. While normally advantageous, this property can be detrimental as it potentially allows the propagation of incorrect electrical signals. These gap junctions can close to isolate damaged or dying tissue, as in a myocardial infarction. Under normal conditions, electrical activity is spontaneously generated by the SA node, the physiological pacemaker.  This electrical impulse is propagated throughout the right and left atria, stimulating the myocardium of the atria to contract. The conduction of the electrical impulse throughout the atria is seen on the ECG as the P wave. As the electrical activity is spreading throughout the atria, it travels via specialized pathways, known as internodal tracts, from the SA node to the AV node. The AV node functions as a critical delay in the conduction system.  Without this delay, the atria and ventricles would contract at the same time, and blood wouldn\'t flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles.  The delay in the AV node forms much of the PR segment on the ECG. And part of atrial repolarization can be represented by PR segment. The distal portion of the AV node is known as the Bundle of His.  The Bundle of His splits into two branches in the interventricular septum, the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch.  The left bundle branch activates the left ventricle, while the right bundle branch activates the right ventricle.  The left bundle branch is short, splitting into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle.  The left posterior fascicle is relatively short and broad, with dual blood supply, making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage. The two bundle branches taper out to produce numerous Purkinje fibers, which stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract. The spread of electrical activity through the ventricular myocardium produces the QRS complex on the ECG. The last event of the cycle is the repolarization of the ventricles. An impulse (action potential) that originates from the SA node at a rate of 60 - 100 beats/minute (bpm) is known as normal sinus rhythm. If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate less than 60 bpm, the heart rhythm is known as sinus bradycardia.  If SA nodal impulse occur at a rate exceeding 100 bpm, the consequent rapid heart rate is sinus tachycardia. Sinus bradycardia may not always be indicative of disease. Trained athletes, for example, often have heart rates < 60 bpm when not exercising.  If the SA node fails to initialize the AV Junction can take over as the main pacemaker of the heart.  The AV Junction ""surrounds"" the AV node (the AV node is not able to initialize its own impulses) and has a regular rate of 40 to 60 bpm.  These ""Junctional"" rhythms are characterized by a missing or inverted P Wave.  If both the SA node and the AV Junction fail to initialize the electrical impulse, the ventricles can fire the electrical impulses themselves at a rate of 20 to 40 bpm and will have a QRS complex of greater than 0.12 seconds.', 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm defined by an irregular, disorganized heartbeat.

where is watermelon grown in the united states,"['Why not leave a comment or a suggestion? Be the first to leave a comment.', 'Watermelon refers to both the edible fruit and vine-like plant (Citrullus lanatus of the family Cucurbitaceae) of a climbing and trailing herb originally from southern Africa and one of the most common types of melon. This flowering plant produces a special type of fruit known by botanists as a pepo, a type of egigynous berry or false berry (accessory fruit) that is derived from an inferior ovary and is characteristic of the Cucurbitaceae, a family that also includes cucumbers, squashes (such as pumpkins), luffas, and muskmelons (such as cantaloupe). In species of Cucurbitaceae, other parts of the flower (including the basal parts of the sepals, petals, and stamens) can ripen along with the ovary, forming the false berry. The watermelon has a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center composed of mesocarp and endocarp. The watermelon fruit, loosely considered a type of melon (although not in the genus Cucumis), has a smooth exterior green and yellow rind and a juicy, sweet, usually red or yellow, but sometimes orange, interior flesh. The plants produce male and female flowers separately on the same plant, and the female flowers have inferior ovaries. The flesh consists of highly developed placental tissue within the fruit. All parts of the watermelon fruit are used by people, including the fleshy interior, the seeds, and the rind. The flesh may be eaten fresh or used to flavor drinks, and is an excellent source of vitamins C and A, as well as a good source of vitamin B6 and vitamin B1 and various minerals. The seeds are eaten as a snack or added to other dishes, and may be roasted and seasoned. They are a good source of fat and protein. The rind is edible and may be stir-fried, stewed, pickled or even grilled. Beyond these values, the watermelon plant provides aesthetic delight and the fruit an appeal to the senses of taste, sight, and touch. Ecologically, the watermelon flowers provide a source of nectar and pollen for bees. American humorist Mark Twain, in one of his novels, had a character colorfully refer to the watermelon as ""chief of this world\'s luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took; we know it because she repented."" David Livingstone, an explorer of Africa, described watermelon as abundant in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa, where it is believed to have originated. There, the ancestral melon grows wild and is known as the Tsamma melon (Citrullus lanatus var citroides). It is recognizable by its pinnatifid leaves and prolific fruit, up to 100 melons on a single vine. For this reason it is a popular source of water in the diet of the indigenous people. The flesh is similar to the rind of a watermelon and is often known as citron melon (distinct from the actual citron, of the citrus family). It is used for making pickles, and because of its high content of pectin is popular as a constituent of jams, jellies, and other gelled preserves. It has established itself in the wild in Baja California. It is not known when the plant was first cultivated, but Zohary and Hopf (2000) note evidence of its cultivation in the Nile Valley from at least as early as the second millennium B.C.E. Finds of the characteristically large seed are reported in Twelfth dynasty sites; numerous watermelon seeds were recovered from the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun (Zohary and Hopf 2000). By the tenth century C.E., watermelons were being cultivated in China, which is today the world\'s single largest watermelon producer. By the thirteenth century, Moorish invaders had introduced the fruit to Europe; and, according to John Mariani\'s The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, ""watermelon"" made its first appearance in an English dictionary in 1615. Museums Online South Africa list watermelons as having been introduced to North American Indians in the 1500s. Early French explorers found Native Americans cultivating the fruit in the Mississippi Valley. Many sources list the watermelon as being introduced in Massachusetts as early as 1629 (Orzolek et al. 2010). Southern food historian John Egerton has said he believes African slaves helped introduce the watermelon to the United States (Motes et al. n.d.). Parsons (2002) lists African slaves and European colonists as having distributed watermelons to many areas of the world. Parsons also mentions the crop being farmed by Native Americans in Florida by 1664 and the Colorado River area by 1799. Other early watermelon sightings include the Midwestern states (1673), Connecticut (1747), and the Illiana region (1822) (Parsons 2002). Until the 1940s, however, it was hard to find watermelons in good condition at grocery stores. Melon lovers had to grow their own (which tended not to keep for long), purchase them from local grocers supplied by truck farmers, or purchase them from roadside produce stands. Now they can be found in most any local grocery store and, if preferred, in slices or whole, with seeds or without. Charles Fredric Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina, set out to produce a disease-resistant and wilt-resistant watermelon. The result was ""that gray melon from Charleston."" Its oblong shape and hard rind made it easy to stack and ship. Its adaptability meant it could be grown over a wide geographical area. It produced high yields and was resistant to the most serious watermelon diseases: anthracnose and fusarium wilt. Today, farmers in approximately 44 states in the U.S. grow watermelon commercially, and almost all these varieties have some Charleston Gray in their lineage. Georgia, Florida, Texas, California, and Arizona are the United States\' largest watermelon producers (CBHS 2006). This now-common watermelon is large enough that groceries often sell half or quarter melons. There are also some smaller, spherical varieties of watermelon, both red- and yellow-fleshed, sometimes called ""icebox melons."" There are numerous cultivars of watermelon, which can differ in shape, rind color, fruit size, type of seed, and color of flesh. One may find 2 kilogram (cantaloupe-sized) to 40 kilogram watermelons, watermelons with light green to very dark green rinds, and flesh color that is red, pink, yellow, orange, and white. In the United States, the most popular is the the large (15 to 35 pound), elongated-oval shape with a striped or variegated, two-tone gray or gray-green rind and red flesh (Herbst 2015). The following are some other common varieties: For commercial plantings, one beehive per acre (4,000 m² per hive) is the minimum recommendation by the US Department of Agriculture for pollination of conventional, seeded varieties. Because seedless hybrids have sterile pollen, pollinizer rows of varieties with viable pollen must also be planted. Since the supply of viable pollen is reduced and pollination is much more critical in producing the seedless variety, the recommended number of hives per acre, or pollinator density, increases to three hives per acre (1,300 m² per hive). Although so-called ""seedless"" watermelons have far fewer seeds than the seeded varieties, they generally contain at least a few soft, pale, edible seeds. They are the product of crossing a female tetraploid plant (itself the product of genetic manipulation, using colchicine) with diploid pollen. The resulting triploid plant is sterile, but will produce the seedless fruit if pollenized by a diploid plant. For this reason, commercially available seedless watermelon seeds actually contain two varieties of seeds; that of the triploid seedless plant itself (recognizable because the seed is larger), and the diploid plant, which is needed to pollenize the triploid. Unless both plant types are grown in the same vicinity, no seedless fruit will result. This system for growing seedless watermelons was first developed by H. Kihara in Japan and subsequently improved by O J Eigsti in partnership with Kihara. This scientific relationship was begun at the Third International Genetics Congress, held in Stockholm, Sweden in 1948. Their collaboration lasted for over 20 years until Kihara died in 1986. Eigsti, a professor at Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana, developed a tetraploid hybrid in the 1950s, which became the gold standard for all seedless watermelons developed since then. In 1986, Eigsti\'s company was reorganized and a joint venture, American Sunmelon, was entered into with SunWorld International and in the ensuing eleven years, seedless watermelon became a staple in supermarkets around the world. In 1998, Eigsti\'s tetraploid hybrid along with all of the assets of American Sunmelon were sold to Syngenta, the seed producing arm of Novartis A.G. In Japan, farmers of the Zentsuji region found a way to grow cubic watermelons, by growing the fruits in glass boxes and letting them naturally assume the shape of the receptacle (BBC News 2001). The square shape supposedly makes the melons easier to stack and store, but the square watermelons are often more than double the price of normal ones. Pyramid-shaped watermelons have also been developed. All parts of a watermelon fruit—fleshy interior, seeds, and rind—can be used. Herbst (2015) notes that Asians love the seeds roasted and that in many parts of the world the pickled rind is a favorite. A one-cup serving of watermelon will provide around 48 calories. Watermelon is an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin A. Watermelon also provides significant amounts of vitamin B6 and vitamin B1, as well as the minerals potassium and magnesium. Pink watermelon is also a source of the potent carotenoid antioxidant, lycopene. Watermelon is 92 percent water by weight, the highest percentage of any fruit. Fresh watermelon may be eaten in a variety of ways and is also often used to flavor summer drinks and smoothies. In the United States and South Africa, one may also find an alcoholic novelty known as a hard watermelon, or a watermelon that has been enhanced with an alcoholic beverage. This process involves boring a hole into the watermelon, then pouring the liquor inside and allowing it to mix with the flesh of the fruit. The watermelon is then cut and served as normal. Watermelon seeds are rich in fat and protein, and are widely eaten as a snack, added to other dishes, or used as an oilseed. Specialized varieties of watermelon are grown that have little watery flesh but concentrate their energy into seed production. In China, watermelon seeds are one of the most common snack foods, popular especially with women, competing with sunflower seeds, and sold roasted and seasoned. In West Africa, they are pressed for oil, and are popular in egusi soup and other dishes. There can be some confusion between seed-specialized watermelon varieties and the colocynth, a closely-related species with which they share many characteristics, uses, and similar or identical names. Watermelon rinds are also edible, and sometimes used as a vegetable. In China, they are stir-fried, stewed, or more often pickled. When stir-fried, the de-skinned and de-fruited rind is cooked with olive oil, garlic, chili peppers, scallions, sugar and rum, providing a way to utilize the whole watermelon. Pickled watermelon rind is also widespread in Russia, Ukraine, and Romania. Grilled watermelon, known as watermelon steak due to its visual similarity to raw steak, has started to become a popular item in restaurants. The watermelon also has been used as a popular symbol. The watermelon slice is striking and unmistakable in appearance. It looks like a kuku flower in bloom. Art related to the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead — October 31–November 2) commonly depicts watermelons being eaten by the dead or shown in close conjunction with the dead. This theme appears regularly on ceramics and in other art from the holiday. Watermelons are a frequent subject in Mexican still life art. The image of a watermelon slice being eaten and general references to watermelons sometimes historically have been used derogatorily. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, African Americans often were depicted in racist caricatures as being inordinately fond of watermelon. Southerners of any race frequently have been lampooned for the fruit\'s popularity in the South over the years; however, some of the folk humor about Southerners has been gentle self-parody, as seen in the annual watermelon seed-spitting contests at Southern festivals like Georgia\'s ""Redneck Games."" In 2007, the Oklahoma State Senate passed a bill in 2007 declaring watermelon as the official state vegetable, with some controversy about whether it is a vegetable or a fruit (Jackson and Mock 2007). Assuming that character of Pudd\'nHead Wilson speaks for the author of the novel of the same name, then Mark Twain was very fond of watermelon indeed. In this novel he wrote, ""It is the chief of this world\'s luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took; we know it because she repented."" All links retrieved June 11, 2020.

Watermelons likely originated in southern Africa, where they grow wild. At 90% water, the\xa0melons were a valuable and portable thirst quencher when natural water supplies were scarce or contaminated. Watermelons were cultivated in the Nile Valley from the second millennium BC. Watermelon seeds have been found at Twelfth Dynasty sites (1991–1802 BC).\xa0The Book of Numbers (11:15) mentions that after the Israelites left Egypt (around 1446 BC), melons were one of the foods they greatly missed, along with\xa0leeks,\xa0garlic,\xa0onions, and\xa0cucumbers.

Early French explorers found them being cultivated by Native Americans in the Mississippi Valley.\xa0Throughout the 16th century, European traders and explorers bartered for produce with the Native Americans, who had obtained cucumbers and\xa0watermelons\xa0from the Spanish, and added them to the crops they were already growing, including several varieties of\xa0corn\xa0and\xa0beans,\xa0pumpkins,\xa0squash, and gourds.\xa0Not too long after, they spread to Japan. “Watermelon” made its first appearance in an English dictionary in 1615.\xa0They were introduced in Massachusetts as early as 1629. Enslaved Africans helped introduce watermelons to the United States. They were grown by Native Americans in Florida by 1664 and were growing in what would become the Midwestern states by 1673. Watermelons were growing in Connecticut by 1747 and in the Colorado River basin by 1799.\xa0Watermelons grew along the border of Illinois and Indiana by 1822. In\xa0the 1840s and 1850s in Sumter, South Carolina, Nathaniel Napoleon Bradford (1809-1882)\xa0developed a namesake watermelon with a reputation of being sweet, flavorful, and with a tender skin that was good for pickling. The tender skin also made it difficult to ship. \xa0Nathaniel shared seeds of his watermelon with some seed traders in the early 1850s, who developed a very profitable commercial line that became the most popular and widespread watermelon of the 19th century in spite of its resistance to shipping. By the early 1900s watermelons had been developed with hard, thick skins and tough rinds at the sacrifice of flavor, ultimately more profitable because they were able to be shipped stacked many layers deep on railroad cars with very little breakage. \xa0The commercial line of the Bradford watermelon disappeared, but the Bradford family kept growing the original watermelon. Seedless watermelon was developed in 1939. Yellow-fleshed watermelon, often sweeter, have grown in popularity as well. In 1954, Charles Fredric Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina, developed a disease-resistant and wilt-resistant watermelon, the Charleston Gray.

When purchasing a whole, uncut watermelon, choose one that feels heavy for its size\xa0with a relatively smooth rind that is slightly dulled on top, with a creamy yellow spot underneath where it was resting on the ground. Uncut watermelons are best stored at temperatures of 50-60°F (10–16°C).

Better storage temperatures will typically be found in cellars or basements that are partly or completely below ground level.\xa0Avoid contact with high ethylene-producing foods like passion fruit, apples, peaches, pears, and papaya. Wash the watermelon before cutting it. Due to its large size, you will probably not be able to run it under water in the sink.

The flesh is similar to the rind of a watermelon and is often known as citron melon (distinct from the actual citron, of the citrus family); it is used for making pickles, and because of its high content of pectin is popular as a constituent of jams, jellies, and other gelled preserves. It has established itself in the wild in Baja California. It is not known when the plant was first cultivated, but Zohary and Hopf note evidence of its cultivation in the Nile Valley from at least as early as the second millennium BC. Finds of the characteristically large seed are reported in Twelfth dynasty sites; numerous watermelon seeds were recovered from the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun.[1] By the 10th century AD, watermelons were being cultivated in China, which is today the world\'s single largest watermelon producer.  By the 13th century, Moorish invaders had introduced the fruit to Europe; and, according to John Mariani\'s The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, ""watermelon"" made its first appearance in an English dictionary in 1615. Until the 1940s, however, it was hard to find watermelons in good condition at grocery stores. Melon lovers had to grow their own, which tended not to keep for long, purchase them from local grocers supplied by truck farmers, or purchase them from roadside produce stands.  Now they can be found in most any local grocery store, and if preferred in slices or whole, with seeds or without. Then Charles Fredric Andrus, a horticulturist at the USDA Vegetable Breeding Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina, set out to produce a disease-resistant and wilt-resistant watermelon. The result was ""that gray melon from Charleston."" Its oblong shape and hard rind made it easy to stack and ship. Its adaptability meant it could be grown over a wide geographical area. It produced high yields and was resistant to the most serious watermelon diseases: anthracnose and fusarium wilt. Today, farmers in approximately 44 states in the U.S. grow watermelon commercially, and almost all these varieties have some Charleston Gray in their lineage. Georgia, Florida, Texas, California and Arizona are the USA\'s largest watermelon producers. This now-common watermelon is large enough that groceries often sell half or quarter melons. There are also some smaller, spherical varieties of watermelon, both red- and yellow-fleshed, sometimes called ""icebox melons."" For commercial plantings, one beehive per acre (4,000 m² per hive) is the minimum recommendation by the US Department of Agriculture for pollination of conventional, seeded varieties. Because seedless hybrids have sterile pollen, pollinizer rows of varieties with viable pollen must also be planted. Since the supply of viable pollen is reduced and pollination is much more critical in producing the seedless variety, the recommended number of hives per acre, or pollinator density, increases to three hives per acre (1,300 m² per hive). Their collaboration lasted for over 20 years until Dr. Kihara died in 1986. Dr. Eigsti developed a tetraploid hybrid in the 1950s which became the gold standard for all seedless watermelons developed since then. In 1986, Dr. Eigsti\'s company was reorganized and a joint venture (American Sunmelon) was entered into with SunWorld International and in the ensuing eleven years seedless watermelon became a staple in supermarkets around the world. In 1998, Dr. Eigsti\'s tetraploid hybrid along with all of the assets of American Sunmelon were sold to Syngenta, the seed producing arm of Novartis A.G. In Japan, farmers of the Zentsuji region found a way to grow cubic watermelons, by growing the fruits in glass boxes and letting them naturally assume the shape of the receptacle. (BBC)  The square shape supposedly makes the melons easier to stack and store, but the square watermelons are often more than double the price of normal ones. Pyramid shaped watermelons have also been developed. Fresh watermelon may be eaten in a variety of ways and is also often used to flavor summer drinks and smoothies. The simplest way to cut a watermelon is to slice it crossways and then to slice the resulting round slabs into halves or quarters (pictured above).  This method is generally used in a casual setting where people do not mind the juices flowing everywhere.  Since the rind provides a handle, no utensils are needed. If the watermelon is to be eaten in conjunction with a meal, it is generally cut into bite-sized squares or balled with a melon baller.  The resulting pieces are often mixed with other melons and fruits and possibly a syrup to form a fruit salad. A one-cup serving of watermelon will provide around 48 calories.  Watermelon is an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin A, with one serving containing 14.59 mg of vitamin C and 556.32 IU of vitamin A.  Watermelon also provides significant amounts of vitamin B6 and vitamin B1, as well as the minerals potassium and magnesium.  Pink watermelon is also a source of the potent carotenoid antioxidant, lycopene. Grilled watermelon, known as watermelon steak due to its visual similarity to raw steak, is beginning to become a popular item in restaurants. Watermelon rinds are also edible, and sometimes used as a vegetable.  In China, they are stir-fried, stewed, or more often pickled. When stir-fried, the de-skinned and de-fruited rind is cooked with olive oil, garlic, chili peppers, scallions, sugar and rum (and provides a great way to utilize the whole watermelon).  Pickled watermelon rind is also widespread in Russia and Romania.[citation needed] Watermelon seeds are rich in fat and protein, and are widely eaten as a snack, added to other dishes, or used as an oilseed.  Specialized varieties are grown which have little watery flesh but concentrate their energy into seed production. In China watermelon seeds are one of the most common snack foods, popular especially with women, competing with sunflower seeds, and sold roasted and seasoned.  In West Africa, they are pressed for oil, and are popular in egusi soup and other dishes.  There can be some confusion between seed-specialized watermelon varieties and the colocynth, a closely-related species with which they share many characteristics, uses, and similar or identical names. The watermelon slice is striking and unmistakable in appearance. Art related to the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead — October 31–November 2) commonly depicts watermelons being eaten by the dead or shown in close conjunction with the dead.  This theme appears regularly on ceramics and in other art from the holiday. Watermelons are a frequent subject in Mexican still life art. The image of a watermelon slice being eaten and general references to watermelons sometimes historically have been used derogatorily. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, African Americans often were depicted in racist caricatures as being inordinately fond of watermelon. Southerners of any race frequently have been lampooned for the fruit\'s popularity in the South over the years; however, some of the folk humor about Southerners has been gentle self-parody, as seen in the annual watermelon seed-spitting contests at Southern festivals like Georgia\'s ""Redneck Olympics.""  Musician Fats Waller jokingly referred to watermelon as ""Georgia ham"" in an ad-libbed aside during a recording of his song ""I\'m Crazy \'Bout My Baby"". Additionally, the word ""watermelon"" has been used since the late 20th century as a term describing left-wing Green party members, referring to them as ""green on the outside, red on the inside"" (red being the color commonly associated with communism.) Assuming that character of Pudd\'nHead Wilson speaks for the author of the novel of the same name,Template:Or then Mark Twain was very fond of watermelon indeed. In this novel he wrote, ""It is the chief of this world\'s luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took; we know it because she repented."" Fans of the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League have adopted the \'melonhead\' (a carved out watermelon shell used as a hat or football helmet) as a symbol of their \'Rider Pride\'. It is widely accepted that this originated primarily because the \'Riders official colors are green, white, black, and silver, and that the melon shell placed on the head resembles the helmets that the players use. Attempts were made to pioneer the ""Wheathead"" (Wheat being a more prominent crop in Saskatchewan agriculture) modelled after the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League\'s, \'Cheesehead\' phenomenon, the \'Wheathead\' campaign was largely a failure and the \'melonhead\' still stands as a symbol of Saskatchewan football fans.', 'Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum & Nakai, family Cucurbitaceae) refers to both fruit and plant of a vine-like (climber and trailer) herb originally from southern Africa and one of the most common types of melon. This flowering plant produces a special type of fruit known by botanists as a pepo, which has a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center (mesocarp and endocarp); pepos are derived from an inferior ovary and are characteristic of the Cucurbitaceae. The watermelon fruit, loosely considered a type of melon (although not in the genus Cucumis), has a smooth exterior rind (green and yellow) and a juicy, sweet, usually red, but sometimes orange, yellow, or pink interior flesh. It is not known when the plant was first cultivated, but Zohary and Hopf note evidence of its cultivation in the Nile Valley from at least as early as the second millennium BC. Finds of the characteristically large seed are reported in Twelfth dynasty sites; numerous watermelon seeds were recovered from the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun,[1] although the existence of the fruit in ancient Egypt is not certain because it is not depicted in any hieroglyphic text nor does any ancient writer mention it. It wasn’t present in any other culture of the ancient Mediterranean. A closeup of a watermelon leafBy the 10th century AD, watermelons were being cultivated in China, which is today the world’s single largest watermelon producer. By the 13th century, Moorish invaders had introduced the fruit to Europe; and, according to John Mariani’s The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, “watermelon” made its first appearance in an English dictionary in 1615. In Vietnam, legend holds that watermelon was discovered in Vietnam long before it reached China, in the era of the Hùng Kings. According to legend, watermelon was discovered by Prince Mai An Tiêm, an adopted son of the 11th Hùng King. When he was exiled unjustly to an island, he was told that if he could survive for six months, he would be allowed to return. When he prayed for guidance, a bird flew past and dropped a seed. He cultivated the seed and called its fruit “dưa tây” or western melon, because the birds who ate it flew from the west. When the Chinese took over Vietnam in about 110 BC, they called the melons “dưa hảo” (good melon) or “dưa hấu”, “dưa Tây”, “dưa hảo”, “dưa hấu”—all words for “watermelon”. An Tiêm’s island is now a peninsula in the suburban district of Nga Sơn. Watermelons on display by a roadside vendor in Delhi, IndiaMuseums Online South Africa list watermelons as having been introduced to North American Indians in the 1500s. Early French explorers found Native Americans cultivating the fruit in the Mississippi Valley. Many sources list the watermelon as being introduced in Massachusetts as early as 1629. Southern food historian John Egerton has said he believes African slaves helped introduce the watermelon to the United States. Texas Agricultural Extension horticulturalist Jerry Parsons lists African slaves and European colonists as having distributed watermelons to many areas of the world. Parsons also mentions the crop being farmed by Native Americans in Florida (by 1664) and the Colorado River area (by 1799). Other early watermelon sightings include the Midwestern states (1673), Connecticut (1747), and the Illiana region (1822).

Pyramid shaped watermelons have also been developed. Fresh watermelon may be eaten in a variety of ways and is also often used to flavor summer drinks and smoothies. Watermelon contains about six percent sugar by weight, the rest being mostly water. As with many other fruits, it is a source of vitamin C. It is not a significant source of other vitamins and minerals unless one eats several kilograms per day. The amino acid citrulline was first extracted from watermelon and analysed. \xa0Watermelons contain a significant amount of citrulline and after consumption of several kg an elevated concentration is measured in the blood plasma, this could be mistaken for citrullinaemia or other urea cycle disorder. Watermelon rinds are also edible, and sometimes used as a vegetable. In China, they are stir-fried, stewed, or more often pickled. When stir-fried, the de-skinned and de-fruited rind is cooked with olive oil, garlic, chili peppers, scallions, sugar and rum. Pickled watermelon rind is also commonly consumed in the Southern US, [8] Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria.[citation needed] In Balkans, specially Serbia, watermelon slatko is also popular Watermelon is 92 percent water by weight. Watermelon is also mildly diuretic. Watermelons contain large amounts of beta carotene. Watermelon with red flesh is a significant source of lycopene. A traditional food plant in Africa, this fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare. my family grows watermelon every summer in our garden. this was so helpful to my research for my project.

On April 16, 1947, in the Port of Texas City, Texas, at Galveston Bay, a mid-morning fire started on board the French-registered vessel SS Grandcamp (docked in the port) and detonated her cargo of about 2,300 tons of ammonium nitrate intended for fertilizer. This started a chain reaction of fires and explosions in other ships and nearby oil-storage facilities, ultimately killing at least 581 people, including all but one member of the Texas City fire department. More than 5,000 people were injured, over 500 homes were destroyed and hundreds damaged, and some 2,000 were left homeless. The seaport was destroyed, and many businesses were flattened or burned. Over 1,100 vehicles were damaged and 362 freight cars were obliterated; the property damage was estimated at $100 million (equivalent to $1.2 billion in 2020). The disaster drew the first class action lawsuit against the United States government on behalf of 8,485 plaintiffs, under the recently enacted 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). On April 13, 1950, a Texas District Court found the United States responsible for a litany of negligent acts of omission and commission by 168 named agencies and their representatives, in the manufacture, packaging, and labeling of ammonium nitrate. This was further compounded by errors in transport, storage, loading, fire prevention, and fire suppression, all of which led to the explosions and the subsequent carnage. On June 10, 1952, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision (197 F.2d 771),  finding that the claim did not meet the requirements of the FTCA, stating that “This Act does not subject the Government to a previously unrecognized type of obligation.”  It noted: The Act does not apply to “any claim * * * based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.” Sec. 2680(a). This is a “highly important exception”. H. Report 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Session, 1945, pp. 5 & 6. As Judge Woodrough, speaking for the Eighth Circuit, pointed out in Coates v. United States, 181 F.2d 816, 817, 818, 19 A.L.R.2d 840, “the term `discretionary function or duty’ has a long history of precise meaning in a legal sense”. It was meant “to continue to exclude judicial authority from interference with lawful legislative and executive action”. See also 56 Yale Law Journal, p. 545.” The Supreme Court granted certiorari “because the case presented an important problem of federal statutory interpretation.”  In Dalehite et al. v. United States (346 U.S. 15, June 8, 1953), a 4-3 opinion, it accepted the Circuit Court’s reasoning. Justice Stanley Forman Reed, writing for the Court, observed that no individual acts of negligence could be shown.  And the legislative history of the FTCA indicated that while Congress desired to waive the Government’s immunity from actions for injuries to person and property occasioned by the tortious conduct of its agents acting within their scope of business,\xa0it was not contemplated that the Government should be subject to liability arising from acts of a governmental nature or function. Section 2680(a), Justice Reed averred based on the legislative history, was intended to preclude any possibility that the bill might be construed to authorize suit for damages against the Government growing out of authorized activity, such as a flood control or irrigation project, where no negligence on the part of any government agent is shown, and the only ground for the suit is the contention that the same conduct by a private individual would be tortious. The Court noted that the District Court had no jurisdiction under the federal statute to find the U.S. government liable for “negligent planning decisions” which were properly delegated to various departments and agencies. That is, the FTCA clearly exempts “failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty,” and the Court found that all of the alleged acts in this case were discretionary in nature: Petitioners rely on the word ‘wrongful’ though as showing that something in addition to negligence is covered. This argument, as we have pointed out, does not override the fact that the Act does require some brand of misfeasance or nonfeasance, and so could not extend to liability without fault; in addition, the legislative history of the word indicates clearly that it was not added to the jurisdictional grant with any overtones of the absolute liability theory. Rather, Committee discussion indicates that it had a much narrower inspiration: ‘trespasses’ which might not be considered strictly negligent. Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 2690, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 43—44. Had an absolute liability theory been intended to have been injected into the Act, much more suitable models could have been found. . . . In short, the Court concluded, the alleged ‘negligence’ does not subject the Government to liability. The decisions implicated in subsequent disastrous events were all responsibly made at a planning rather than operational level and involved considerations more or less important to the practicability of the Government’s fertilizer program.  The Court affirmed the Circuit Court’s findings. The Dalehite decision was eventually “appealed” to Congress, where relief was granted by means of legislation (Public Law 378, 69 Stat. 707, 1955).  When the last claim had been processed in 1957, 1,394 awards totaling nearly $17 million had been made. On this day in history, James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson commenting on Jefferson’s proposal for a text book for the new law school at University of Virginia.  Notably, Madison observed: The ‘Federalist’ may fairly enough be regarded as the most authentic exposition of the text of the federal Constitution, as understood by the Body which prepared & the Authorities which accepted it. Yet it did not foresee all the misconstructions which have occurred; nor prevent some that it did foresee. And what equally deserves remark, neither of the great rival parties have acquiesced in all its Comments. It may nevertheless be admissible as a School book, if any will be that goes so much into detail. It has been actually admitted into two Universities, if not more, those of Harvard & Rh. Island; but probably at the choice of the Professors, without an injunction from the superior authority.” You can read the entire letter here. On January 29, 1783, Connecticut became the first state to pass a general colonial copyright law, 1783 Conn. Acts 133, entitled “An Act for the Encouragement of Literature and Genius.” It was not uncommon for a printer, who had been paid by the author to print a set number of copies, to produce extras to sell on the side. Also, another printer might copy and sell the author’s book without permission.” At the time,  patents were the only form of protection for an author’s work and legislatures generally granted these private bills for relatively short periods. Ultimately, it was John Ledyard who succeeded in securing the first general copyright protection, which set the precedent for other colonies to enact similar laws. John Ledyard.Credit…Ledyard National Bank, via NYT Ledyard, as we learn from another Connecticut history site, was born a ship captain’s son in\xa0Groton, Connecticut in 1751.  He joined the famous expedition with Captain James Cook on the HMS\xa0Resolution\xa0in 1776.  He spent over four years at sea, but deserted the British Navy in 1783 and returned to Connecticut.  He then wrote a memoir of Cook’s voyage largely from memory, although some of it was later found to have been plagiarized.  This was ironic since it was Ledyard who petitioned the General Assembly for copyright protection, leading to a series of state laws that codified that right. The General Assembly, instead of passing a private bill for Ledyard, as had been the custom, issued the first general colonial copyright statute. It secured the rights to the author for 14 years with the ability to renew the copyright once. During the 1780s, following the 1783 legislation of the first general copyright act in America by the Connecticut legislature, \xa0all states but one passed similar statutes, modeled to various degrees after the English Statute of Anne. In 1709 British parliament enacted the Statuteof Anne:  short title: Copyright Act 1709 8 Anne c.21; long title: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned. \xa0Named after Anne, Queen of Great Britain, this was the first copyright statute in Great Britain, and the first full-fledged copyright statute in the world. It was enacted in the regnal year 1709 to 1710, and entered into force on April 10, 1710. The Statute of Anne granted publishers of books legal protection for 14 years with the commencement of the statute. It also granted 21 years of protection for any book already in print. At the expiration of the first 14 year copyright term the copyright re-vested in its author, if he or she were still alive, for a further term of 14 years.] The entrenchment of general authors’ rights in the US came with the 1789 constitutional clause that empowered Congress to ’promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors […] the exclusive Right to their […] Writings’ (The Constitution of the United States of America, Art. 1, §8, cl. 8)  and the 1790 federal Copyright Act (Copyright Act 1790, 1 Stat. 124, 1790). Potter Stewart was born into a powerful Ohio Republican family on this day in history.  He attended Yale for both undergraduate studies and law school, made law review, and graduated cum laude in 1941.  He took a job at a law firm, but enlisted in the Navy when WWII began, acting as defense counsel in court-martial proceedings. After the war, Stewart joined a prominent law firm in Cincinnati, and in 1954, President Eisenhower appointed Stewart to a seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.  In 1958, President Eisenhower named Stewart to a recess appointment to replace retiring Justice Harold H. Burton on the Supreme Court. This was Eisenhower’s third recess appointment, and despite criticism of the practice, Justice Stewart was confirmed by the Senate in a 70-17 vote on May 5, 1959. Oyez reports that Justice Stewart believed in judicial restraint, seeing the proper function of a judge as interpreting the law as it applied to a particular case, rather than attempting to assert judicial influence over matters he saw best left to the legislature.  This put Stewart in the ideological center of the Court, and he became an influential swing vote on many cases. One of his more well-known opinions was in the obscenity case Jacobellis v. Ohio (378 U.S. 184, 1964).  Justice Stewart famously said that while he could not readily define the term “hard-core” pornography, “I know it when I see it.” Justice Stewart stepped down from the Court in July of 1981 at age 66.  He said that his decision was influenced by his desire to spend more time with his grandchildren while he was still in good health. In 1985, he died from a stroke and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Upon his death, journalist Bob Woodward revealed that Justice Stewart was the primary source for The Brethren, the seminal book on the inner workings of the Supreme Court. Rowena Scott Comegys, in her article, “Potter Stewart: An Analysis of His Views on the Press as Fourth Estate,” 59 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 157 (1982), online here, contends that Justice Stewart’s support for freedom of the press stood out as part of his legacy, writing: Stewart indicated in judicial opinions and extrajudicial commentary that he believed that the press deserves a special place among American institutions.  [He believed] the Freedom of Press Clause was a structural provision of the first amendment, which the framers thought necessary in order to assure “openness and honesty in government. . . an adequate flow of information between the people and their representatives . . . [and] a sufficient check on autocracy and despotism. ‘ ‘ As he said in his speech at Yale in 1974, “If the Free Press guarantee meant no more than freedom of expression, it would be a constitutional redundancy.” Ada Lois Sipuel (later married to Warren Fisher), a Black woman, was born on February 8, 1924 in Chickasha, Oklahoma.  She was an excellent student and was her high school valedictorian.  She graduated from Langston University in Oklahoma with honors and hoped to become a lawyer.   As a site by the Oklahoma Historical Society explains, Blacks were not allowed to attend white state universities such as the University of Oklahoma which had a law school.  Instead, Oklahoma actually provided funding for Blacks to go outside the state of Oklahoma and attend law schools and graduate schools that accepted them. At the urging of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) twenty-one-year-old Fisher agreed to seek admission to the University of Oklahoma’s law school in order to challenge Oklahoma’s segregation laws and achieve her lifelong ambition of becoming a lawyer. The president of the University of Oklahoma agreed that Fisher had the necessary credentials, but pointed out that Oklahoma statutes prohibited whites and Blacks from attending classes together. The laws also made it a misdemeanor to instruct or attend classes comprised of mixed races. Had they admitted Fisher, the president would have been fined up to fifty dollars a day, and the white students who attended class with her would have been fined up to twenty dollars a day. On April 6, 1946, Fisher filed a lawsuit in the Cleveland County District Court, prompting a three-year legal battle. The future U.S. Supreme Court justice, Thurgood Marshall, represented Fisher. She lost her case in the county district court and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. It sustained the ruling of the lower court, finding that the state’s policy of segregating whites and Blacks in education did not violate the United States Constitution. Fisher then filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. On January 12, 1948, the court ruled per curiam in Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma (332 U.S. 631) that Oklahoma must provide Fisher with the same opportunities for securing a legal education as it provided to other citizens of Oklahoma: The State must provide it for her in conformity with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and provide it as soon as it does for applicants of any other group.” According to Supreme Court Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, who sat in the gallery and watched Marshall argue the case before the court on January 8, 1948, Marshall was “respectful, forceful and persuasive – so persuasive that on the following Monday – only four days after the argument – the Court unanimously ruled in Sipuel’s favor.” The case was remanded to the Cleveland County District Court to carry out the ruling. Following the Supreme Court’s favorable ruling, the Oklahoma Legislature, rather than admit Fisher to the Oklahoma University law school or close the law school to students both Black and white, decided to create a separate law school exclusively for her to attend. As Melvin Hall writes for the Oklahoma Historical Society, the new school, named Langston University School of Law, was thrown together in five days and was set up in the State Capitol’s Senate rooms. It was not be any means “equal.” On March 15, 1948, Fisher’s lawyers filed a motion in the Cleveland County District Court contending that Langston’s law school did not afford the advantages of a legal education to Blacks substantially equal to the education whites received at OU’s law school. The Cleveland court ruled against her, averring that the two state law schools were “equal.” The Oklahoma Supreme Court  upheld the finding. Fisher’s lawyers announced their intention to again appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Oklahoma attorney general knew it was a lost cause to argue equality in front of the same court. As a result of this concession, on June 18, 1949, more than three years after Fisher first applied for admission to the University of Oklahoma College of Law, she was admitted. She enrolled on June 18, 1949, becoming the first African American woman to attend an all white law school in the South. It was not a total experience in “equality”: Fisher was forced to sit in the back of the room behind a row of empty seats and a wooden railing with a sign designated “colored.” All of the Black students enrolled at the University of Oklahoma were provided separate eating facilities and restrooms, separate reading sections in the library, and roped-off stadium seats at the football games. These conditions persisted through 1950. But as Hall contends, the end of segregation in higher education had already begun. In 1948 a group of six Black Oklahomans applied to University of Oklahoma’s graduate schools in disciplines ranging from zoology to social work. All were denied admission under the same statute that denied admission to Fisher. Thurgood Marshall selected one of the six students, George W. McLaurin, to present yet another challenge to segregation in higher education. On June 5, 1950, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, that the restrictions of segregation imposed on McLaurin at OU impaired and inhibited his ability to study. Meanwhile, in August, 1952 Fisher graduated from the University of Oklahoma College of Law. She earned a master’s degree in history from the University of Oklahoma in 1968. After briefly practicing law in Chickasha, Fisher joined the faculty of Langston University in 1957 and served as chair of the Department of Social Sciences. She retired in December 1987 as assistant vice president for academic affairs. In 1991 the University of Oklahoma awarded Fisher an honorary doctorate of humane letters. On April 22, 1992, Gov. David Walters appointed Dr. Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher to the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, the same school that had once refused to admit her to its College of Law. As the governor said during the ceremony, it was a “completed cycle.” The lady who was once rejected by the university was now a member of its governing board. In April 1992, Gov. David Walters appointed Fisher to the OU Board of Regents – the very group that had once rejected her. Gov. Walters said during the ceremony it was a “completed cycle.” Via UO College of Law Fisher died on October 18, 1995. In her honor the University of Oklahoma subsequently dedicated the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Garden on the Norman campus. At the bottom of a bronze plaque commemorating Fisher’s contribution to the state of Oklahoma, an inscription reads, “In Psalm 118, the psalmist speaks of how the stone that the builders once rejected becomes the cornerstone.” On this day in history, President Harry Truman declared a national emergency over the perceived threat of communism he felt had just increased exponentially by the massive Chinese intervention in the Korean War. The United Steel Workers of America threatened a strike at that very time, which would have imperiled steel production at a time when nearly all military weapons required steel. Thus Truman also issued Executive Order 10340, which followed the national emergency declaration, so Truman could order the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of and operate plants and facilities of steel companies to ensure the manufacture of “the weapons and other materials needed by our armed forces and by those joined with us in the defense of the free world.” President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiated U.S. involvement in the Korean War Proclaiming that “Communist imperialism” threatened the world’s people, Truman called upon the American people to help construct an “arsenal of freedom.” Despite Truman’s argument that his position as commander-in-chief afforded him the power to make all military decisions, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled 6-3 in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer (343 US 579, 1952), that Truman lacked the constitutional authority to nationalize the steel industry.  As summarized by Oyez: The Court found that there was no congressional statute that authorized the President to take possession of private property. The Court also held that the President’s military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces did not extend to labor disputes. The Court argued that ‘the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.’” Professor Charles Lund Black, Jr. (1915-2001), was one of the leading constitutional law scholars of the twentieth century. In this restatement of much of his life’s work, he attempted to put the jurisprudence of human rights on firm legal ground. Black looked to three sources for human rights:  the Declaration of Independence, the Ninth Amendment, and the “privileges and immunities” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Declaration declares “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” The Ninth Amendment provides that “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Article 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment says “1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Black considered the Declaration of Independence to be not only a source of law, but “law” itself.  Why not?  After all, it is the founding document that “established” the United States. But even if the Declaration is not considered “law,” the ninth and fourteenth amendments are most certainly law – national law, which Article VI of the Constitution, provides is the supreme law of the land, superior to anything enacted by any of the “several states.” The ninth amendment, though rarely cited in Supreme Court opinions, as indicated above states that the failure of the constitution to enumerate certain “rights” shall “not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”  But what are those unenumerated rights?  Black proposed they should include those mentioned in the Declaration, which was adopted only thirteen years before the passage of the Ninth Amendment. And because the Ninth Amendment applies only to the Federal Government, the Fourteenth Amendment is needed to protect citizens from the actions of the states, which, Black pointed out, are the principal abridgers of human rights. Although the 14th Amendment has acted as a check on actions by the states to limit human rights, the jurisprudence surrounding it has been faulty.  The federal courts have relied on the “due process” clause of the amendment to find various state actions unconstitutional.  This is all well and good where the state action was an unfair procedure (process), but that clause’s language simply does not seem to cover an unfair or otherwise constitutionally inappropriate substantive provision. Professor Charles L. Black Black contended that reliance on the due process clause to invalidate overreaching by state governments has resulted in some poor decisions and fuzzy analysis.  Instead, he pointed to the privileges and immunities clause, augmented by the 9th Amendment and a reference to the Declaration of Independence, as a better guide to the human right jurisprudence. Black further argued that those three sources of human rights not only protect against state infringement, but also impose on Congress an affirmative constitutional duty to see that all citizens have a decent chance to “pursue happiness.”  He said, “There is then nothing exotic to the Constitution in the proposition that a constitutional justice of livelihood should be recognized….”  He wanted our national debate about the elimination of poverty to shift from a matter of compassion to one of a constitutional right.  In his words, “The general diffusion of material welfare is an indispensable part in the general diffusion of the right to the pursuit of happiness.” Black believed that “the pursuit of happiness” should be adopted as a fundamental right, created by the Declaration of Independence, incorporated in the Constitution and imposed on the federal government through the Ninth Amendment, and imposed on the states through the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The simple insight of the right to pursue happiness would reach out to every field of human rights: It would make plain the wrong in every kind of discrimination hurtful to women.  It goes to the essence of the wrongs done by the law and outside the law to those having homosexual preferences.  It could clarify the ultimate grounds of the banning of racial discrimination against blacks and other racial minorities.” Moreover, we need not fear that such an extension of such rights would go “too far.”  After all, the law effectively limits the right of free speech and religion. An analysis similar to that which prohibits yelling “fire” in a crowded theater (limiting speech) and prohibits ritual animal sacrifice (limiting religion) would keep pursuit of happiness jurisprudence within reasonable bounds. Black dedicated the book to Abraham Lincoln, who also looked to the Declaration of Independence as a source of “law” when he referred to it in the Gettysburg Address. Black thought perspicaciously and wrote clearly; this exceptionally good book is highly recommended. Virginia led the way in legislation punishing slaves and also in removing punishments for whites who abused them in any way.  Other colonies then followed Virginia’s example. As the late civil rights advocate and federal court judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. wrote for the Washington Post: With each succeeding decade, the Virginia legislators, expressing a mixture of fear, greed and prejudice, simply reduced the privileges and rights of blacks. They rationalized their actions on the ground of security, without religious or moral qualm whatsoever.” There was no legal declaration that Africans were to be slaves, but rather a series of cases, followed by legislation, that dealt with the practical problems arising from the custom of holding Africans as slaves.  The effect of these laws and deci\xadsions was to make it increasingly difficult for Blacks to be any\xad thing but slaves. The paths of escape from this condition were gradually narrowed until choked off nearly altogether.” One of these laws, passed on this day in history, removed criminal penalties for enslavers\xa0who killed enslaved people resisting authority. The assembly justified the law on the grounds that “the obstinacy of many [enslaved people] cannot be suppressed by other than violent means.” The law provided that an enslaver’s\xa0killing of an enslaved person could not constitute murder because the “premeditated malice” element of murder could not be formed against one’s own property.

It was an organization of “night-riding white supremacists who terrorized Black families, and a good many white Republicans, as it sought to cripple the Republican party and its supporters, which included virtually all African-Americans.”  (Ryan, Allan A., Amos Akerman: Grant’s Attorney General Who Broke the Back of the Ku Klux Klan (July 4, 2021). Available at SSRN here. Lou Falkner Williams, in “The Great South Carolina Ku Klux Klan Trials, 1871-1872, an online dissertation for U. Of Florida, observed that “The Ku Klux Klan was the white solution to a Black population which refused to stay in its place and maintain a slavelike demeanor.” As Eric Foner, a preeminent historian of Reconstruction, described the Klan, “It was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired the restoration of white supremacy.” (Eric Foner, Reconstruction, America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, pp,. 425-26) “All those” of course consisted of white males. During the presidential campaign of 1868, the KKK emerged as a “paramilitary wing” of the Democratic Party.  Robert J. Kaczorowski, in “Federal Enforcement of Civil Rights During the First Reconstruction,” 23 Fordham Urb. L.J. 155 (1995), reports that the KKK “embarked on a campaign of terror for the purpose of destroying the Republican Party in the Southern states and reducing Southern Blacks to the control of white supremacists.”  After Grant was elected to the presidency, terrorist acts by the KKK increased.  Thus, Kaczorowski notes, “Congress created the Department of Justice in 1870 in large part for the purpose of providing more effective protection against Klan terrorism.” In April, 1871, President Grant signed the Ku Klux Klan Act, which made it a federal crime to deprive American citizens of their civil rights through racial terrorism.   He then sent US Attorney General Amos T. Akerman along with Army Major Lewis Merrill to South Carolina to investigate reports of violence against newly freed Blacks.  According to the Equal Justice Initiative, in York County alone they found evidence of eleven\xa0murders and more than 600 whippings and other assaults. Amos T. Akerman Lou Falkner Williams wrote that “Akerman left South Carolina convinced that ‘from the beginning of the world until now,’ no community ‘nominally civilized, has been so fully under the domination of systematic and organized depravity.’” (p. 94). He concluded the KKK activities “amount(ed) to war,” and recommended to President Grant that he use the full extent of his powers to suppress the KKK in South Carolina. On October 12, 1871, President Grant warned nine South Carolina counties with prevalent KKK activity that martial law would be declared if the Klan did not disperse. The warning was ignored. On October 17, 1871 –  this day in history – President Grant declared martial law and suspended the writ of habeas corpus in the same nine counties. Once he did so, federal forces were allowed to arrest and imprison KKK members and instigators of racial terrorism without bringing them before a judge or into court. Many affluent Klan members fled the jurisdiction to avoid arrest but by December 1871 approximately 600 Klansmen were in jail. More than 200 arrestees were indicted, fifty-three\xa0pleaded guilty, and five were convicted at trial. Klan terrorism in South Carolina decreased significantly after the arrests and trials but racial violence targeting Black people continued throughout the South for decades. You can read President Grant’s proclamation suspending habeas corpus here. The Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1650s was a Puritan stronghold with little tolerance for other religions.  Carl Sigmond, author of “Quakers fight for religious freedom in Puritan Massachusetts, 1656-1661” in the Global Nonviolent Action Database, contended that “A fear was\xa0embedded\xa0in the Puritan society that if they started to admit outsiders, they would lose their political and religious control of the colony.” Beginning in 1656, he noted, members of the newly formed Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) started to arrive in the Massachusetts colony on ships from England, where Quakerism had recently emerged. The Quakers who arrived in Boston’s harbor demanded that they be allowed to live in Massachusetts and practice their own religion freely. They were greeted by intense hostility and were often forced to board the next ship out. They continued to come, however, and thus governors of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth both took legal steps to prevent Quakers from entering their colonies. As a Massachusetts online history site reports, in late 1656 and 1657, the General Court passed a series of laws that outlawed “the cursed sect of heretics commonly called Quakers,” as they were named in the first act of this nature passed on this day in history.  Captains of ships that brought Quakers to Massachusetts Bay were subject to heavy fines; so was anyone who owned books by Quakers or dared to defend the Quakers’ “devilish opinions.” As for Quakers themselves, it was decreed that “what Quaker soever shall arrive in this country from foreign parts, or shall come into this jurisdiction from any parts adjacent, shall be forthwith committed to the House of Correction; and, at their entrance, to be severely whipped, and by the master thereof be kept constantly to work, and none suffered to converse or speak with them, during the time of their imprisonment, which shall be no longer than necessity requires.” You can read the text of the law here. Blog at WordPress.com. WP Designer.', 'A blog of the U.S. National Archives When Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas traveled around Illinois in 1858 debating each other while vying for a seat in the U.S. Senate, they weren’t looking for votes from the masses. They were seeking votes in the Illinois legislature. Douglas was the incumbent senator, and Lincoln, who had served one term in the House in the 1840s, was a railroad attorney. In the 1850s, U.S. senators were selected by the state legislatures as directed by Article I, Section 3, of the Constitution, which says: “The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one vote.” According to the Senate Historical Office, the framers thought that having senators elected by the legislatures would aid senators because they would be less subject to pressure and have more time to do business. And, they felt, direct election would strengthen ties between the national and state governments. But opposition to this arrangement began long before the Lincoln–Douglas debates. Political problems in states resulted in many seats going empty for long periods. Support grew slowly for popular, or direct, election of senators by voters. Strong resistance in the Senate to a proposed Constitutional amendment calling for direct elections meant the idea got nowhere for many years. Finally, in 1911, the Senate approved a proposed Amendment allowing direct election, and the House followed suit the next year. It won approval by the required three-fourths of the state legislatures by April 8, 1913, and was declared part of the Constitution, the 17th Amendment, on May 31 by Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. States still had two senators, elected for six year terms and with one vote each. When there is a vacancy, the governor of the state shall call for a special election to fill the remainder of the term and, if empowered by the legislature, appoint someone to serve as senator until one is elected by the voters. Seats in the U.S. House, however, remain vacant until a new representative is chosen in a special election. The Constitution does not provide for appointments to vacant House seats. In that 1858 Senate race, Douglas kept his seat, and Lincoln found another office to seek. Your email address will not be published.

In Connecticut, there is an unexpected opportunity to unseat veteran Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) in 2010. In New Jersey, incumbent Gov. Jon Corzine (D) trails his Republican challenger in the polls. Several House races seem promising in neighboring New York, where Democratic Gov. David Paterson’s bungling of a recent Senate appointment has jeopardized both his seat and the one now held by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). It’s not exactly a rebirth, but the combination of some self-inflicted Democratic wounds, the economic downturn and the departure of President George W. Bush has shell-shocked Northeastern Republicans cautiously optimistic about their fortunes in 2010. “To predict there is now a groundswell of support for Republicans is a little pretentious,” said former Rep. Charlie Bass (R-N.H.), who lost a reelection bid in 2006. “But clearly the traditional voter in the Northeast is looking more closely at Republicans with Bush and the war in Iraq not on the front burner anymore. Now the Democrats have their scandals, they have their problems, and the American people are looking back and thinking we need to balance things out.” People, and that means voters, can tell when they got a bad deal….

Criticism of Gov. David Paterson’s handling of the Caroline Kennedy fiasco continued unabated Tuesday. “I’m going to address this issue for the last time,” Paterson said. Slim chance. With the New York Post comparing his ability to tell the truth to Pinocchio, Paterson was on the hot seat again Tuesday over his administration’s handling of Kennedy. “I had nothing to do with any of the negative characterizations of any of the candidates, particularly Caroline Kennedy,” Paterson said. But reporters — some of whom had received calls from “sources close to the governor” attacking Kennedy — peppered the beleaguered governor with questions about the leaks. He was also asked if he would give lie detector tests to his staff. “I’m not going to hunt down scurrilous rumors,” Paterson said. After just eight minutes of the tough grilling the governor stalked out of the room with reporters left still asking questions. “Are you going to apologize to Caroline Kennedy?” one reporter asked. The furor detracted from the new Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s brief swearing in, where she promised to uphold the constitution. The controversy has caused the governor’s popularity to plummet. The long and the short of it: Kirsten Gillibrand becomes the Senator from New York;\xa0 seen with Vice President Joe Biden in the Old Senate Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2009, before a mock swearing in ceremony..(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Just think for a moment about the three U.S. Governors most seen in the nationl media. Governor Paterson of New York just passed up an opportunity to appoint Caroline Kennedy to the U.S. Senate, choosing instead a relative unknown House member supported by the NRA, Kirsten E. Gillibrand. Paterson also just cancelled a trip funded by the taxpayers to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “Perhaps it would be a better idea to go at another time,” Paterson said.\xa0 Or maybe never…. Illinois Governor\xa0Rod Blagojevich is all over TV, apparently fighting to keep his hair from getting mussed in prison.\xa0 His impeachment trial opened monday in Illinois but that is just an opening: there is sure to be a criminal trial. Blago also caused his Demoicratic Party some heartburn during his dramatic naming of a former Illinois notable to fill the vacant Senate seat of barack Obama.

Governor Schwarzenegger has warned that the Golden State is on the brink of insolvency; yet he seems to be working like a dog and in a bipartisan way to make things better…. “The government has created kind of a mess and that’s a problem to be solved, but the negatives are actually fairly small. I think you can expect a lot of good out of California,” he said. The typically upbeat Schwarzenegger made international headlines this month when, instead of delivering his usual cheery “state of the state” speech, he issued a short, bleak message about California’s roughly $1.5 trillion economy. A beleaguered Gov. Paterson pulled out of his Switzerland trip Monday as a new poll showed his once-huge lead over Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has virtually disappeared. Paterson was planning to leave Thursday to attend and speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, but said he decided to stay to concentrate on the state budget. “Because of the deficit reduction and the desire to get it moving as soon as possible … perhaps it would be a better idea to go at another time … and stay right here with the leaders of the Legislature and work on the budget,” Paterson told reporters in Hyde Park, Dutchess County. Some critics felt he should forgo the taxpayer-funded trip and stay in New York to deal with the $15.8 billion budget deficit. Posted in Arnold, california, Caroline Kennedy, Illinois, Kirsten E.

Two Governors recently made single-man selections of United States Senators — a practice voters should no longer tolerate. Governors have the power to appoint “interim” Senators in cases such as when\xa0a seated and elected Senator’s dies.\xa0 But in each of these cases, there seems to have been ample time and reason to hold special elections to allow the people to decide who they wanted representing them in the United States Senate…. Rethink Practice of Governors Filling Vacant U.S. Senate\xa0Seats The departure of four Democratic senators this year has cast a new — and at times, unflattering — light on governors and their power to fill Senate vacancies. While governors must call a special election to replace members of the House who resign or die before their term is up, 38 states allow governors the sole power to appoint an interim senator, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. Just nine states require a special election to fill a Senate vacancy. In three other states — Hawaii, Utah and Wyoming — governors must select a candidate from a list of prospective appointees submitted by representatives of the departing incumbent’s political party. Choosing a new senator has led to considerable drama for the four governors tasked with doing so this year. All have weathered some level of opprobrium for their choices or for how they handled the selection, with one — Rod Blagojevich of Illinois — facing criminal charges for trying to barter President Barack Obama‘s former seat for cash and favors. “Politically, the choices made by the governors so far have been pretty odd,” said Seth Masket, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver. Most recently, New York Gov. David Paterson engaged in a messy, drawn-out effort to name a replacement for Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama’s secretary of state. The process was largely dominated by a high-profile lobbying campaign by Caroline Kennedy, the 51-year-old daughter of President John F. Kennedy hoping to win the nod. New York Gov. David Paterson, seen here in 2008, has chosen state congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand, a relative unknown on the political scene, to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton, US media said Friday.(AFP/Getty Images/File/Chris Hondros) Gov. Paterson, defying the liberal wing of his Democratic Party, has chosen little-known, NRA-backed, upstate Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as New York’s junior senator, it was learned last night. The surprising – and, for many Democrats shocking – decision to pick the conservative Gillibrand, 42, from Hudson in Columbia County, was disclosed by the governor in calls to party officials and some members of the state’s congressional delegation, many of whom said they were unhappy with the selection, sources said. The governor of New York has chosen state congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand, a relative unknown on the political scene, pictured here in 2007, to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton, US media said Friday.(AFP/File/Mannie Garcia) Democratic congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand is the New York governor‘s pick to fill Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton‘s vacate Senate seat. An aide to the governor tells The Associated Press that the 42-year-old Gillibrand will be named by Gov. David Paterson on Friday. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not been made. Gillibrand (JIL’-uh-brand) was a dark horse, lacking the name recognition of Caroline Kennedy, who withdrew her candidacy, or even the seniority of other New York representatives vying for the job. But she is a proven vote-getter in her sprawling eastern New York district. She picked off an entrenched Republican incumbent in 2006 and cruised to re-election last year. Gov. David A. Paterson has selected Representative Kirsten Gillibrand, a 42-year-old congresswoman from upstate who is known for bold political moves and centrist policy positions, to fill the United States Senate seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a person who spoke to the governor early Friday. Caroline Kennedy, widely believed to have been a contender for the vacant U.S. Senate seat in New York once held by Hillary Clinton, removed herself from consideration last night due to “tax trouble and an employee problem,” according to sources close to the situation. A source to the New York Post said Kennedy was \xa0“mired” in an issue over taxes, her nanny and possibly her marriage. Senator Edward Kennedy’s staff is said to be angry because Caroline seemed to be using his illness as her excuse. The New York Times, for instance, wrote in its Thursday morning edition: “The person who spoke with Ms. Kennedy said she cited concerns about the health of her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who suffers from brain cancer and was hospitalized after a seizure Tuesday, as the reason for her abrupt withdrawal.” Time Magazine said, “He is crazy about her. He encouraged her” in her bid for the Senate seat, one close associate says of Ted Kennedy’s relationship with his niece. “But using him as an excuse, as though things were on the downward spiral, is not going to be O.K. with him … This will get in the way of health reform” – by suggesting that a key legislator involved in putting the bill together may be incapacitated. Danny Hakim and Nicholas Confessore wrote for the New York Times Thursday that “Problems involving taxes and a household employee surfaced during the vetting of Caroline Kennedy and derailed her candidacy for the Senate, a person close to Gov. David A. Paterson said on Thursday, in an account at odds with Ms. Kennedy’s own description of her reasons for withdrawing.” Ms. Kennedy’s employee problem, known to involve a housekeeper, is believed to include tax irregularities and withholding for an alien. Interestingly, President Barack Obama’s Treasury Secretary nominee has admitted to tax problems already…. Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy F. Geithner told the Senate Committee considering\xa0his nomination\xa0that the nonpayment of payroll taxes in the three years he was at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2004 “were careless mistakes. They were avoidable mistakes. But they were unintentional. I should have been more careful.” Fool Timothy Geithner testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on his nomination to be US Treasury Secretary at the Dirksen Senate office Building in Washington, DC. Geithner apologized Wednesday over past tax transgressions….\xa0 He wants to run the IRS so he can make sure you pay your taxes….”I was careless”….(AFP/Mandel Ngan) He remains the nominee for Secretary of the Treasury. In 2004,\xa0 President Bush’s choice for Secretary of Homeland Security, Bernard Kerik, was forced to withdraw himself from consideration for the post when it was revealed that he had employed an illegal alien nanny and failed to withhold taxes from her paycheck. The former New York City police commissioner would have been responsible for enforcing the immigration laws he violated had he been confirmed by the Senate. Kerik\xa0was not the first cabinet appointee to be derailed by violations of immigration and tax laws. President Clinton’s first two choices for Attorney General, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, and President Bush’s first choice for Secretary of Labor, Linda Chavez, were scuttled by revelations that they had employed illegal immigrants in clear violation of the federal laws they would be required to enforce in those jobs. Kennedy jumped to the top of statewide polls in early December, but her public support waned following a brief upstate tour and a few press interviews. She was criticized as reluctant to answer questions, and her knowledge of New York and its issues were suspect. She was also mocked nationwide for her frequent use of “you know” and “um” in interviews and was branded a lackluster campaigner. The Kennedy reports came hours after Rep. Carolyn Maloney, some Democrats’ top choice, was named chair of the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. That’s a significant move because Paterson had made it clear the next senator’s top job should be to help land a federal stimulus package to help New York out of its historic fiscal crisis. In a stunning revelation, a source close to Gov. David Paterson insisted this afternoon that the governor “had no intention” of picking Caroline Kennedy for New York’s vacant senate seat – because she was “mired” in an issue over taxes, her nanny and possibly her marriage. Kennedy was “mired in some potentially embarrassing personal issues,” the source said, citing tax liabilities and worker compensation liabilities connected to the employment of a nanny. The source also said the state of her marriage may have presented a problem as well. “She has a tax problem that came up in the vetting and a potential nanny issue,” the soruce said. “And reporters are starting to look at her marriage more closely,” the soruce continued, refusing to provide any specifics.

Except in newspaper interviews, TV shots and talks with others she sounded like a lightweight or, you know, an inarticulate jerk who has no experience or reason to be a U.S. Senator. So the Democrat Party Leadership of the State of New York has decided not to model itself after Illinois and the Nutjob Blagoyevich-Rush-Burris trio. New York is “floating” the idea of a “caretaker” senator with the gravitas of, say, Bill Clinton or Mario Cuomo. We here at Peace and Freedom favor a special election in most of these cases of vacant seats; but in Illinois just now the legislature rejected the idea of a special election and chose to impeach the Governor and go from there. But they ran out the clock and the Governor got the last shot off before the buzzer. The Illinois Governor named his one-time rival Roland Burris to fill Barack Obama’s vacant U.S. Senate seat. And, as David Broder of the Washington Post says, “Everyone, including Obama, has been exceedingly polite in their public comments about Burris. I have known him for years, and I like him. But I have never been confused about the level of his talent.” Sen. Bill Clinton? Sen. Mario Cuomo? Don’t completely rule it out. The former president and the former New York governor are among several boldface names being touted as possible “caretakers” for New York’s Senate seat — people who would serve until the 2010 elections but wouldn’t be interested in running to keep the job. As the process of picking Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton’s replacement gets messier, the option may become increasingly attractive to Gov. David Paterson, who has sole authority to name a successor. A spokesman for Bill Clinton, Matt McKenna, said Wednesday that the former chief executive isn’t interested in the job and plans to continue the work of his foundation. Cuomo declined through a spokesman to discuss the Senate seat. A big name could have an immediate impact for New York in the Senate while letting the large field of hopefuls duke it out in 2010, according to three Democratic Party advisers in New York and Washington who are close to the discussion with Paterson’s inner circle on this issue. Two others in the party confirmed that Paterson is still considering the caretaker option. The advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment. “You could find a very senior person who could serve New York well” on an interim basis, said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist and dean at the State University of New York at New Paltz. “Then you can say to Caroline Kennedy, `You know, you’d make a good senator. Run for it.’ And you can tell everyone else that it’s a level playing field.” US Senate hopeful Caroline Kennedy, seen here in October 2008, drew stinging criticism Tuesday over her weekend interviews after weeks of silence, with many lampooning her as a clumsy and unfocused speaker.(AFP/Getty Images/File/Win Mcnamee) Interviews with more than a dozen people who have met or spoken with her in recent weeks reveal a fairly uniform portrait of the private Ms. Kennedy in her first turn as a very public woman. Most described her as courteous but reticent, unfailingly gracious but not exactly passionate. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, who has known Ms. Kennedy for years and had lunch with her this month, said Ms. Kennedy was smart, shy and reserved. Keith L. T. Wright, a Democratic state assemblyman from Harlem who spoke with Ms. Kennedy on the phone a few days before Christmas, said she had yet to light a fire among potential backers. “I don’t know many people who are ready to go ‘Rah! Rah! She’s our candidate,’”\xa0 he said.

This fully corresponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government”.\xa0 -Federalist 9, by Alexander Hamilton Montana bill SJ-10, to repeal the 17th Amendment, in 2003 passed the Judiciary Committee 6-3 but was defeated in the full Senate. In 1791 the state legislatures ran the United States Senate, but the 17th Amendment passed in 1913, reversed the power of the states, removing their control over Washington and creating two separate and redundant Houses of the People.. With no guidance by the legislatures, Congress has a misdirected role, duplicating functions the Constitution had given to the states.\xa0\xa0 Gun regulation should be a federal issue whenever it involves\xa0 the movement of guns between states, sale of a gun to a non-resident, or when the separate state legislatures see need for a uniform law,.\xa0 A Senate not answerable to the state legislators will pass bills to please their constituents, duplicating House bills and negating more relevant laws passed by the separate states. The 17th Amendment did more than increase the role of the federal government.\xa0 It fundamentally changed the Constitution because it ended\xa0 the states legislative role\xa0 in Washington. The States’ Liberty Party will repeal the 17th Amendment\xa0 and reaffirm the perpetuity of the United States Constitution\xa0 and first several amendments. In the original design by the Framers of the U.S. Constitution, there was an effective check on Congress through the state legislatures’ power to appoint (and remove) U.S. Senators.\xa0 The 17th Amendment\xa0 eliminated the checks and balances available to the states over federal power or over Congress itself in any area. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority the Supreme Court recognized that the seventeenth amendment, which provides for the popular election of Senators, may have diminished the influence that state governments have over the federal political process and, thereby, the effectiveness of the states’ role in that process Friends For America– a non-profit Corp.\x96was founded by volunteers to bring about a rebirth of freedom by restoring the balance of powers between the state governments and national government, with a mission of educating state legislators of their responsibility to maintain states rights and sovereignty. He said that he was from the future and had come back in time to point out an error in the proposed constitution for the states.\xa0 I was just getting ready to point out to him that what he foresees as the future of this country could never happen according to his imaginary account. Aside from the checks in the Constitution there is the moral fiber of humanity that gets it’s sustenance from above. The people of this soon to be born nation will never allow such foolish things to happen. Thomas Jefferson once stated during the formation of the U.S. Government: “We might hope to see the finances of the Union as clear and intelligible as a merchant’s books, so that every member of [the] Union, should be able to comprehend them to investigate abuses, and consequently to control them.” The Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, changed the method of selecting senators from election by state legislatures to popular election. This change was made during the height of the Progressive Era, a populist movement that sought increased suffrage, a bigger role for government, and other democratic reforms. The U.S. Constitution has changed over time, sometimes by formal amendment and other times by judicial interpretation, presidential and congressional action, and general custom and practice. That New Hampshire and the sovereign people of this state from this day forward shall not be subject to any law, rule, resolution, code, or executive order that exceeds the scope of the several parts of the constitutions of either New Hampshire or of the subordinate United States of America. With respect to states’ rights, it should be readily apparent to all that state governments cannot exert any meaningful influence or control over the federal government, judiciary, or any other federal institution. For more information, I respectfully refer you to a law review article that I wrote, Amplifying the Tenth Amendment, 31 ARIZ. L. REV. 915 (1989). This article was cited as “worth reading” by the National Law Journal, in its March 5, 1990, publication. Additionally, I direct you to two books written by George Haynes titled “The Senate of the United States” published in 1938, and “The Election of Senators” published in 1906. I believe that you will find that these references are well worth reading. In my opinion, the 17th Amendment should be repealed. This would reinstate the states’ linkage to the federal political process and would, thereby, have the effect of elevating the present status of the state legislatures from that of lobbyists, to that of a partner in the federal political process. The state legislatures would then have the ability to decentralize power when appropriate. It would give state legislatures direct influence over the selection of federal judges and the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary and much greater ability to modify federal court orders. This structure would allow the flow of power between the states and the federal government to ebb and flow as the needs of our federal republic change. The existing relationship, combined with the effect of the Supremacy Clause, is guaranteed to concentrate power into the hands of the federal government with little or no hope of return. With that, the state governments should be focusing an effort to repeal the 17th Amendment, not on passing legislation or engaging in irrelevant activities, that are more than likely useless over the long term and probably also over the short. The constitutional amendment proposed would reinstate the states’ linkage to the federal political process and would, thereby, have the effect of elevating the status of the state governments from that of lobbyists, to that of a partner in the federal political process.\xa0 Figure A above portrays the existing relationship between the states and the federal government.\xa0 This relationship, combined with the effect of the Supremacy Clause, is guaranteed to concentrate power into the hands of the federal government with little hope of return. With the passage of the amendment, the state legislatures would have the ability to decentralize power when appropriate.\xa0 After passage, it would primarily be the state legislatures interacting with their appointed senators, and not with the other branches of the federal government, that would establish the “line” between the federal and state governments.\xa0 Figure B shows the effect of the passage of the proposed amendment on the relationship between the governments.\xa0 This structure allows the flow of power between the states and the federal government to ebb and flow as the needs of our federal republic change.\xa0 This structure also exemplifies the original concept of the Framers of the Constitution. A . How many times have you had your U.S. Senator approach you and discuss impending legislation with you? \xa0Even though you voted for them, they probably did not contact you once. But how many times do you suppose they contacted Enron about impending legislation. Enron and other corporations financed their campaigns, to the tune of millions of dollars, to get you to vote these senators into office. You can safely bet that your U.S. Senators discuss impending legislation with these corporations on a routine basis. How often do U.S. Senators discuss federal affairs with your state legislator? I am still looking for a state legislator who has been contacted by their U.S. Senator regarding federal affairs. Prior to the enactment of the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution the U.S. Senators discussed federal affairs with their state legislators on a regular basis. At THAT time U.S. Senators did not have to raise millions of dollars to run for office. They were not beholden to the large corporations. There is no way our U.S. Senators are going to personally discuss federal affairs with, and handle the input from, 900,000 people. The only choice we have before us is to have them discuss our federal affairs with the State Legislatures as opposed to the large corporations. As originally included in the U.S. Constitution, the people of the states will continue to enjoy the right to vote for their U.S. Representatives. I am including the final version of my presentation which I gave today before the Montana Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote. At the time the Constitution was written, the U.S. Representatives were to represent the people and were to be elected by popular vote. The U.S. Senators were to represent the States and were to be elected by the State Legislatures. The 17th Amendment changed the United States Constitution and took away the States representation in our United States government. It states: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications required for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct. This amendment shall not be construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution. Since Representatives in the House are elected by the general population of a state, they represent the individual citizens of the state. People have different anxieties and desires as individuals than they do collectively as a state. In fact, most individual citizens are not even aware of what the state must do to protect its people and their rights. There are 2 main reasons to repeal the 17th Amendment. These reasons are: Campaign Finance Reform and to protect States’ Rights. The sad state of the union is that money talks and public policy is sold to the highest bidder. Less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the U.S. population gave 83 percent of all campaign contributions in the 2002\xa0 elections. Those who give money in political contributions get back billions in tax breaks, subsidies and the right to exploit public land at ridiculously low prices. This system in turn costs ordinary Americans billions of dollars, not to mention the costs to health, safety and the environment, and the cost of not having enough money for good schools. For example, the top corporations that paid zero taxes from 1996 to 1998 included AT&T, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Chase Manhattan, Enron, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Microsoft, Pfizer and Phillip Morris. They gave $150.1 million to campaigns from 1991 to 2001. Public Campaign reports they got $55 billion in tax breaks from 96 to 98 alone, perennial legislation\xa0 to gut the alternative minimum tax and billions in rebates to select\xa0 corporations. Right here in Montana, in the race for Senate between incumbent Max Baucus and challenger Mike Taylor, millions of dollars were spent. Max Baucus raised and spent $6.7 million and Mike Taylor raised and spent 1.8 million. Much of this money came from out of state. Some of the contributions came from: American International Group, Microsoft Corporation, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Chase & Co., Merck & Company, AOL Time Warner, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, National Pro-Life Alliance, National Rifle Association and Retamco Oil and Gas. With the original Constitutional provisions before the 17th Amendment, the U.S. Senate was to be a check on Congress to prevent them from dipping into the National treasury to buy votes. But since the passage of the 17th Amendment, rather than being appointed by the State Legislatures, they too must run expensive election campaigns and, instead of checking the problem, they are now part of the problem. James Madison thought that the States should be active participants in the Federal Government. He said: Whenever power may be necessary for the national government, a certain portion must be necessarily left with the states, it is impossible for one power to pervade the extreme parts of the United States so as to\xa0 carry equal justice to them. The state legislatures also ought to have some means of defending themselves against the encroachments of the national government. In every other department we have studiously endeavored to provide for its self-defense. Shall we leave the states alone un-provided with the means for this purpose? And what better means can be provided than by giving them some share in, or rather make them a constituent part of, the national government? Since the enactment of the 17th Amendment, the states have been reduced from an equal l partner with the Federal Government to a common lobbyist, which has resulted with the loss of State Sovereignty, State Rights and a host of Federal mandates some funded and some unfunded. These mandated include the No Child Left Behind Act with its system of compulsory tests. The other day I heard Eric Feaver, the lobbyist for MEA/MFT, state that he couldn’t understand how any U.S. Senator representing Montana could vote to eviscerate the Montana Constitution. He was talking about the act of our U.S. Senators passing the No Child Left Behind Act. This act might sit well with that portion of the public who are not involved in > politics. But if we, as members of the Montana Legislature, had any say in the matter, we would have insisted it did not do harm to the Montana Constitution or to our state government. It was recently brought to my attention that Governor Martz is proposing hiring a lobbyist in Washington D.C. in order to protect our state’s interests. Prior to the adoption of the 17th Amendment this would have been unnecessary. If the responsibility of electing our U.S. Senators was returned to the State Legislatures, the cost of campaigns would be much lower. It obviously costs less to influence 150 Montana Legislators than it costs to influence the voters in a state of over 900,000 people.\xa0 Rather than paying back the Legislatures in tax breaks, subsidies and\xa0 lands to be exploited, the Federal Government would consider the will of the various state governments when making its laws. We would not have mandatory student testing being imposed upon us by the federal government. There were 2 main reasons the 17th Amendment was adopted in 1913. One was the deadlock of State Legislatures when electing U.S. Senators.\xa0 According to the Montana Historical Society Legislative Minute for January 15: The other was the corruption of the State Legislators. In Montana W.A. Clark bribed our state legislators in order to become a U.S. Senator. Our protection from corrupt State Legislatures are: Term limits; Campaign disclosure statements; Open Caucuses; and We have highly visible public information. Our protection from dead-locked State Legislatures is the provision that if a State Legislature does not fill a vacancy or elect a U.S. Senator within 30 days, the Governor shall appoint the U.S. Senator. I recommend that committee members give extra careful consideration to this proposal. This vote has historic and fundamental ramifications that go back to our founding fathers. We should not be impeded from following the patriotism and wisdom of our Constitution’s framers. Regarding opponents of the measure as Shakespeare said, they are thinking to precisely on the event and are 1 part wise, but 3 parts fearful.

The term bristlecone pine covers three species of pine tree (family Pinaceae, genus Pinus, subsection Balfourianae). All three species are long-lived and highly resilient to harsh weather and bad soils. One of the three species, Pinus longaeva, is among the longest-lived life forms on Earth. The oldest Pinus longaeva is more than 5,000 years old,[1] making it the oldest known individual of any species. Despite their potential age and low reproductive rate, bristlecone pines, particularly Pinus longaeva, are usually a first-succession species, tending to occupy new open ground.[2] They generally compete poorly in less-than-harsh environments, making them hard to cultivate.[2] In gardens, they succumb quickly to root rot.[3] They do very well, however, where most other plants cannot even grow, such as in rocky dolomitic soils in areas with virtually no rainfall.[2] Bristlecone pines grow in scattered subalpine groves at high altitude in arid regions of the Western United States. The name comes from the prickles on the female cones.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine https://www.britannica.com/plant/bristlecone-pine I stole this beaut for 75 bucks, I am very happy\ufeff. you should be... the usual ignore another Monday day...

I think the earliest trees were the fern trees... 3~400 million years ago... now for the who\'s on 1st tree (Sequoias or Bristle Cone)... time to go look/see... would the Aspen figure in here some place because of the root system and how that tree spreads.. ie; the grove on the CO/UT border that is suppose to be like 80,000± years old... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree) Pando (Latin for ""I spread out""), also known as the Trembling Giant,[1][2] is a clonal colony of an individual male quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers[3] and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is located in the Fremont River Ranger District of the Fishlake National Forest at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau in south-central Utah, United States, around 1 mile (1.6\xa0km) southwest of Fish Lake.[4] Pando occupies 43 hectares (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons),[5] making it the heaviest known organism.[6][7] The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.[8][9] There\'s a lot of those Quaking Aspens around here. None real close to me. They seem to like to live within a certain range of elevation. At our 5600\', we may be to low. But, just a few hundred feet higher, they\'re prolific. Plus, where they do grow gets more rain than us. That could be a factor. Just wondering...those really gnarly short pines that grow along Route 1 in N. California...are they Bristle cones? They\'re protected, aren\'t they? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree The earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew in forests in the Carboniferous period. The first tree may have been Wattieza, fossils of which have been found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, Archaeopteris was the earliest known tree.[91] Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the Triassic period. The gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and these may have appeared as a result of a whole genome duplication event which took place about 319 million years ago.[92] Ginkgophyta was once a widespread diverse group[93] of which the only survivor is the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba. This is considered to be a living fossil because it is virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in Triassic deposits.[94] I believe the Sequoias have it... finding when the Bristlecone 1st appeared is proving to be a bit more elusive... https://www.giant-sequoia.com/about-sequoia-trees/about-sequoia-trees/ Sequoiadendrons can be traced to the Triassic Period 200 million years ago when dinosaurs first appeared.

Only 75 emoji are allowed.', 'We stayed in Paradise RV Park. This was our first encounter with a self service park with no reservations. The owner had insured us that this time of year it would not be crowded but we were still a little nervous. It all worked out! We drove up and picked out our spot on the hill and then filled out the registration form and slipped it under the door with our check. It only cost $100 a week, the cheapest site so far! Chris said he sees why but I overlooked all that when I saw the 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains with the most beautiful sunsets every night. I think they should charge more just for the views. Maybe they could use the money to fix up the playground. The park is located in Panquitch, UT which is 25 minutes outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. We chose this location because it’s proximity to Bryce Canyon and it’s in the middle of Zion and Capitol Reef National Parks. Each of those is 2 hours away; Zion to the south and Capitol Reef to the East. Next week we move to Arches National Park where we will also visit Canyonland National Park. All 5 of these parks make up the Mighty 5 of Southern Utah. I will post Bryce Canyon on this post and then post each of the other parks separately. The Quaking Aspen Tree is Utah’s state tree and\xa0my new favorite tree. I splurged and bought myself a pair of real aspen leaf, dipped in 24kt gold, made into earrings at the Bryce Canyon Lodge. From the fluorescent yellow colors their leaves turn in the fall to the white bark with beautiful black scars where they have self pruned to the fact that they spout out of the family root system make them fascinating.\xa0Pando, also known as the Trembling Giant, is a clonal colony of an individual male Quaking Aspen\xa0determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is located in Fishlake National Forest.\xa0Pando occupies 106 acres and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,600 tons,\xa0making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old (some tree experts claim it is over 1 million years old), is thought to be the oldest known living organism. The girls and I drove into Bryce Canyon on Monday to get a lay of the land, get passport books stamped, pick up maps and the Junior Ranger booklets. We learned that they also have a shuttle bus system like Zion but this one is not mandatory so we chose to drive around and check things out in the Jeep. Our first stop was Sunrise point, we did a quick walk along a paved path to catch the views. It was like walking up to the rim of the Grand Canyon and seeing it for the first time. You park among pine trees and then walk to the opening. WOW! The rim of Utah’s high plateau has pastel-colored stones called hoodoos. They are white, pink, and red. Bryce\xa0Canyon is known for the Hoodoos (irregular columns of rock). They exist on every continent, but here is the largest concentration found anywhere on Earth. Situated along a high plateau at the top of the Grand Staircase, the park’s high elevations include vast wildlife, fantastic dark skies, and geological wonders. The next day we waited for Chris to get done with work and took him to the park for the first time so we revisited Sunrise point to hike Queen’s Garden trail. This trail starts at Sunrise point and takes you down to the bottom of the canyon,\xa0descending 320 feet. You will see many hoodoos, representing flowers and plants in a garden. We tried to imagine Queen Victoria in this hoodoo at the end of the trail but just didn’t see it. The girls did find a hidden rock painted with the Flash symbol. We took it to Arches and hid it there. We drove over to Inspiration Point and then to Bryce Point to watch the sunset. The pictures don’t do it justice. Thursday we waited until the late afternoon and headed back to hike the Navajo Loop Trail to see Thor’s hammer and Wall Street. You can combine the Queens Garden trail and the Navajo Loop all in one trip because they connect with a short 0.8 mile trail. We split it up because we are limited to daylight hours when we do family hikes because of the sunset setting early. After hiking them both, I would still suggest hiking them separately so you can see ALL of the Navajo Loop. Wall Street with it’s narrow slot canyons is not to be missed. \xa0We walked over 3 miles among the HooDoos so we earned a special “I hiked the Hoodoos” sticker that we picked up when the girls turned in their Junior Ranger badges. The last day we drove the 18 mile scenic roadway all the way to the end at Rainbow point. We stopped at the Natural Bridge pull out on the way out to Rainbow Point. Highlights of Bryce Canyon are the Amphitheater, \xa0hiking Queen’s Garden, and \xa0walking through the pines at the bottom of the Navajo Loop. We attended an astronomy ranger lead program and learned all about Cassini and it’s final days around Saturn. After the program we went Star gazing through park telescopes in one of Earth’s best dark skies areas. We were able to see binary stars, a star cluster, and Saturn through the telescopes. While we stood in lines waiting for our turn to peek into the galaxy, \xa0we enjoyed pointing out constellations. We don’t have any pictures because we were part of a ranger program that restricted any white lights at all. I borrowed this photo from skyandtelescope.com of what Saturn looked like through the telescope that evening. NASA’s Cassini spacecraft made its final approach to Saturn and dove into the planet’s atmosphere on Friday, Sept. 15. It had been launched in 1997 and entered orbit in 2004 where it started collecting data about Saturn and it’s rings. RIP Cassini. Notify me of new comments via email.

Pando\xa0(Latin\xa0for “I spread out”), also known as the\xa0Trembling Giant,\xa0is a\xa0clonal colony\xa0of an individual male\xa0quaking aspen\xa0(Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical\xa0genetic markers\xa0and assumed to have one massive underground\xa0root system. The plant occupies 43 hectares (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons),\xa0making it the\xa0heaviest known organism.\xa0The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the\xa0oldest known living organisms. Pando is located 1 mile (1.6\xa0km) southwest of\xa0Fish Lake\xa0on\xa0Utah State Route 25,\xa0in the Fremont River Ranger District of the\xa0Fishlake National Forest, at the western edge of the\xa0Colorado Plateau\xa0in south-central\xa0Utah, United States. Pando is currently thought to be dying. Though the exact reasons are not known, it is thought to be a combination of factors including\xa0drought,\xa0grazing, and\xa0fire suppression.\xa0The Western Aspen Alliance, a research group at\xa0Utah State University’s “S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources”, has been studying the tree in an effort to save it, and the\xa0United States Forest Service\xa0is currently experimenting with several 5-acre (2\xa0ha) sections of it in an effort to find a means to save it. A new study published in October 2018 concludes that Pando has not been growing for the past 30–40 years. Human interference was named as the primary cause, with the study specifically citing people allowing cattle and deer populations to thrive, their grazing resulting in fewer saplings and dying trees. Pando is thought to have grown for much of its lifetime under ideal circumstances: frequent forest fires have prevented its main competitor,\xa0conifers, from colonizing the area, and a climate shift from wet and humid to semi-arid has obstructed seedling establishment and the accompanying rivalry from younger aspens. During intense fires, the organism survived underground, with its root system sending up new stems in the aftermath of each wildfire. If its postulated age is correct, the climate into which Pando was born was markedly different from that of today, and it may have been as many as 10,000 years since Pando’s last successful flowering.\xa0Additionally, the post glacial climatic conditions have made it very problematic for new seeds to sprout. According to an\xa0Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\xa0(OECD) report: Clonal groups of\xa0P. tremuloides\xa0in eastern\xa0North America\xa0are very common, but generally less than 0.1\xa0ha\xa0in size, while in areas of Utah, groups as large as 80 ha have been observed (Kemperman and Barnes 1976). In the\xa0semi-arid\xa0western United States, some argue that widespread seedling establishment has not occurred since the last glaciation, some 10,000 years ago (Einspahr and Winton 1976, McDonough 1985). Indeed, some biologists feel that western clones could be as old as 1 million years (Barnes 1966, 1975). The clone now known as Pando was discovered in 1968 by researcher Burton V. Barnes, who continued to study it through the 1970s.\xa0Barnes had described Pando as a single organism based on its morphological characteristics alone; molecular techniques and methods developed since that time have largely substantiated those conclusions. Building on Barnes’s earlier work, Michael Grant of the\xa0University of Colorado at Boulder\xa0re-examined the clone, named it “Pando”, and claimed it to be the world’s most massive organism in 1992. In 2006 the\xa0United States Postal Service\xa0published a stamp in commemoration of the aspen, calling it one of the forty “Wonders of America.” The average age of Pando’s stems is 130 years, as indicated by tree rings. The roots are 80,000 years old.\xa0Michael Grant in\xa0BioScience\xa0said: …quaking aspen regularly reproduces via a process called suckering. An individual stem can send out lateral roots that, under the right conditions, send up other erect stems; from all above-ground appearances the new stems look just like individual trees. The process is repeated until a whole stand, of what appear to be individual trees, forms. This collection of multiple stems, called ramets, all form one, single, genetic individual, usually termed a clone. Tree experts also note that the organism’s age cannot be determined with the level of precision found in\xa0tree rings; some claim Pando’s age is closer to 1 million years.\xa0Its current 80,000-year designation is based on a complex set of factors, including the history of its local environment, the evidence indicating that there are few if any naturally occurring new aspens in most of thewestern United Statessince a climate shift took place 10,000 years ago which eliminated favorable soil conditions for seedlings, the rate of growth (including the differences of rates in distinctclimateswhen accounting for its local-climate history, the fact that males grow more slowly than females, and the fact that aspens grow more slowly at higher elevations—Pando is at 2,697\xa0m, or 8,848\xa0ft, above sea level), its size, and its\xa0genetic codein comparison to themutationsfound among aspens born in the modern era. Michael Grant summed it thus: Conversely, other observations in the region show that seedling establishment of new clones is regular, and often abundant on sites exposed by\xa0wildfire.\xa0J. L. Howard (U.S. Forest Service\xa0Fire Effects Information System) states: Kay documented post-fire quaking aspen seedling establishment following 1986 and 1988 fires in\xa0Grand Teton\xa0and\xa0Yellowstone\xa0National Parks, respectively. He found seedlings were concentrated in\xa0kettlesand other topographic depressions, seeps, springs, lake margins, and burnt-out riparian zones. A few seedlings were widely scattered throughout the burns. In Grand Teton National Park, establishment was greatest (950–2,700 seedlings/ha) in 1989, a wet year, but hundreds to thousands of seedlings established each year despite\xa0drought\xa0conditions in 1986–1988 and 1990–1991. Seedlings surviving past one season occurred almost exclusively on severely burned surfaces. Other candidates for oldest or heaviest living organisms include the possibly larger\xa0fungal mats\xa0in\xa0Oregon, the ancient clonal\xa0Creosote bushes, and strands of the clonal marine plant\xa0Posidonia oceanica\xa0in the\xa0Mediterranean Sea. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree) Мненията на редакцията и на автора/ите могат да не съвпадат.

You’ve heard all the hoopla and wondered if its worth the time and money. Let me assure you that it is worth every penny. Why? It’s all about the connections. Connecting with your ancestors. Connecting with fellow genealogists. Connecting with the genealogy world. Let’s take a look at each of those and give you some solid reasons to attend the largest, most exciting genealogy and family history conference in the world. You are addicted to family history because you feel it – that connection to your ancestors. At RootsTech you will be inspired to connect with your ancestors in new ways. The 2018 conference will include four days of classes and four general sessions. Each of those general sessions will feature celebrities talking about their own connection to their ancestors.\xa0As RootsTech 2018 Ambassadors, Nicole and I will be sharing \xa0several posts previewing keynote speakers and giving you all the information you need to know for a successful RootsTech experience. Why celebrity keynote speakers? I’ll never forget Levar Burton’s moving words or the emotion he showed when a FamilySearch representative presented him with his family history. There is a power that comes from connecting to our ancestors and being among thousands of others who share those feelings is remarkable. RootsTech is also the forum for FamilySearch\xa0to announce what’s new and exciting. During the opening session of RootsTech 2017, Steve Rockwood introduced us to Pando, a giant group of aspen trees that share a common root system. Defined on Wikipedia,¹ Pando (Latin for “I spread”), also known as the Trembling Giant, is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. Pando aspen grove at Fishlake National Forest ; By J Zapell – http://www.fs.usda.gov/photogallery/fishlake/home/gallery/?cid=3823&position=Promo, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27865175 Steve compared the\xa0FamilySearch\xa0Family Tree to Pando. Every single family tree, no matter how unique it is, is ultimately connected . . . Like any single aspen tree, a family tree is only a small part of a much, much larger organism. Steve encouraged us to use the collaborative FamilySearch Family Tree to connect our ancestors to the giant family tree of mankind. He addressed our concern that another user might change our information and explained that we could now use the “Genealogies” tab to upload our own family tree that will preserved as is. If you haven’t yet discovered “Genealogies,” the tab is located under the main “Search” tab at the top of the\xa0FamilySearch\xa0screen. When you click on “Genealogies” you are taken to a page where you can search for your ancestor among various family trees that have been submitted by other users. The screenshot below shows some of the collections here: Guild of One-Name Studies, Community Trees, Oral Genealogies, Partner Trees, Pedigree Resource file, Ancestral File, and the International Genealogical index (IGI). These are trees in their original form. The accuracy of the information is for you to evaluate. What’s the advantage of Genealogies? Not only can you submit your own tree by uploading a GEDCOM file, you can search other trees for your ancestor. This is useful when sorting out bad merges on the\xa0FamilySearch Family Tree. You can see what the relationships and information looked like originally. Wondering what other new developments are coming for\xa0FamilySearch?\xa0RootsTech 2018 will be full of announcements like the Genealogies. You can be among the first to hear of them. If you’re mainly researching at home with just your computer and your ancestors, you need to get out of the house and connect with others like you – people who love family history and genealogy. You may be brand new or you may be experienced, but there is so much to learn from each other. At RootsTech 2018 you meet others researching their roots when you attend classes, wander the expo hall, or even eat lunch. Standing in line last year for my Ancestry DNA kits, I struck up a conversation with the couple behind me and learned they had traveled all the way from Canada to attend the conference. We had a lot to talk about because we share a passion for family. Nicole and I met Belgian researcher, Marie Cappart, as a fellow blogger ambassador. She is an author, professional genealogist, and owns her own business, \xa0histoires de familles. She quickly became a friend and we’re looking forward to seeing her again in 2018. She’s promised to bring Belgian chocolate! Because RootsTech attracts genealogists from around the globe, this is a wonderful way to meet online acquaintances in person and make new friends. Walking through the expo hall you’ll be exposed to family history and genealogy products, applications, and ideas that you had never thought about. You might find exactly what you need to help you get organized, break through a brick wall, or share your family history. You have the opportunity to enter drawings for freebies and you might even win. I won a free custom family tree and was able to update my family history wall. Attending classes of your choice, you’ll get new ideas for your research. I often think about my own journey in family history. Just a month after getting all of my dad’s 30 years of documents, I attended a local family history fair where I learned from professionals how to get started. I will be ever grateful that I took the opportunity to learn from those who already had it figured out. \xa0There is always something new to learn and with the thousands of exhibitors and hundreds of presenters, you’ll connect with the brightest and the best in the genealogy world. As a RootsTech 2018 Ambassador, I will be giving away a free pass. Watch for details how you can enter the contest in the coming months. I hope to see you at RootsTech 2018. I promise you won’t be disappointed! ¹ \xa0 \xa0 “Pando (tree),”\xa0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree) Diana Elder AGⓇ is a professional genealogist, author, and speaker.
